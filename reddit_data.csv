korea,biggest korea travel regret,"whats your biggest regret from your travels in south korea anything from overpacking booking ahead when you didnt need to paying too much for something etc  

if you regret your entire trip sad crown for you  

edit so many great and diverse responses i recommend reading though but to pick out some common themes 
 overpackingoverheavy suitcases  
 visiting during summer and the heat being unbearable  
 underestimating the amount of walking and stairs  
 not learning basic korean  
 not leaving seoul or having enough time in each location"
korea,i recommend you to travel to korea in winter,"i am korean 

the summer from april to september in korea is very hot it is cold from november to february too but it is better than the summer heat the hot weather in korea is very hot enough to interfere with travel
and the streets on snowy days in korea are beautiful 

i hope you enjoy your trip to korea"
korea,is korea  easy  to travel on your own without a good knowledge of the language  ,"hello from france  

i will plan later this year in september a 23 weeks trip in korea on my own i will first land in soul but will want to travel in the country on my own to visit as much as i can
so is it okay to go blindly with a few key phrase in mind like  how can i go there    do you know where this is   etc
or should i prepare more for the language in case english and basic korean will not be enough outside seoul and bussan  

thanks in advance and i hope you had a good day 
"
korea,broad tips from inexperienced traveler to korea,"earlier this year i got to spend a few weeks in and around seoul and traveled a little in jeju and busan for the first time this was also my first time out of my home country only knowing the names of a few dishes and very basic korean words hello thank you etc so i caused myself a lot of embarrassment d here are tips many of which came from this subreddit that helped me  

apps

httpspreviewredditwj19scxbdnld1pngwidth721formatpngautowebpsadfe2b566fe8a6dfb769b48054b721f2c6a0ca20

 i would recommend downloading these apps picture above 

 i used papago a lot to translate menu items coin laundry instructions etc 
 we used kakao t to order taxis 99 of our taxis were prepaid to go from point a to point b so we didnt have to worry about being upcharged or explain directions that much 
 wowpass had 2 purposes its a korean debit card and has a pass for subways and buses however they both need funds added to them i believe they are also loaded up differently 
    to add funds that will be used as a debit card there are a few machines to load it up incheon airport theres one near the arex some international hotels big transit stations i believe you can also transfer the funds back into your original account when youre traveling back
    to add funds for your public transit pass i usually did it two ways  

       theres a list of convenience stores on the app that you can load it up at just ask the cashier to load your tmoney and show them your card and give them how many won you want loaded in it 
       at some subway stations theres a few kiosks where you can load tmoney up i used my won bills to pay for it as well
 naver and kakao maps were absolutely essential for navigating especially when youre on foot or tracking on public transit it will tell you which subway line or bus to take and what stationstop to leave on the maps the highly rated places like at least 4345 stars are helpful to find good spots for food and like i used google maps mostly to find places that are more foreigner friendly as in there were positive english reviews of the place especially when i went to get my hair done the salon owner was fluent in english 
 i used kakao bus mostly to check when and what buses were coming to a particular bus stop but usually there is a sign to indicate this 

money

 keep won bills on you especially if you are going to the street markets and get food or items many vendors have their prices listed and usually only accept cash so having some small bills 1000 and 5000 won were necessary  

 if you have your debt card you can go to international atms theyre at airports and usually in the walkin area of international banks around seoul there you can get korean won but i had a cap per day of the amount able to be withdrawn and there was a small exchange fee 

 you dont have to tip ie stores or most services 

 if you are spending money at stores go to duty free carry your passport and keep your receipts certain stores offer tax refunds but you need your passport they can be processed once youre back at the airport there were some kiosks to put in your receipts then you take the slip it dispenses to the tax refund desk 

transport

 if possible avoid peak traffic hours on the subway in the morning when people are going to and leaving from work it was unavoidable a couple of times for my travel but over time i wasnt as anxious in a crammed subway car and could mostly freely stand without stumbling not much shoving or body contact despite it everyone mostly keeps to themselves 

 when someone gets off and leaves their open seat in front of you sit quickly lol i had someone immediately squeeze past in front of me to take a seat   

 when waiting for a bus especially if its crowded have your transport card in hand ready to scan and that you are in line ready to board it once that bus is pulling in at the stop definitely missed a few buses because i didnt have my card ready lol when you are leaving the bus theres a side entrance that opens for the departing passengers while the front door is reserved for the onboarding passengers like boarding you scan your transport card as you exit

 if you happen to go to gamcheon village beautiful place in busan in those smaller green i think buses prepare yourself for a rocky ride if you dont have seat xd 
 also buses are on time sensitive routes they will most likely start driving as soon as the last person boarding pays so brace a little while you are finding a place to sitstand
 there are little red buttons to press when youre approaching a stop most of the time there was someone else pressing the stop i wanted to get off at but be aware to not miss it

httpspreviewredditkho48rwrjnld1pngwidth828formatpngautowebps2f2fe7f785034ba6b8f0e87c75c4b701dbdbb05f

 above is a screenshot of the subway app 

subway lines were personally confusing for me but they are very efficient convenient and wellmaintained to go around seoul they are color coded and have two lines going in two different directions there are signs with english translations on which station the stop is heading towards next also on the subway car it has a voiceover and a sign that will announce in english the upcoming station like buses subways are not going to have delays really so i tried to get to the platform before they arrived  

 there are some restrooms and shops from clothing to convenience and other miscellaneous items in the subway

etiquette 

 you dont have to hold the doors for other people or be overly friendly in general as long as you are not too loud in public and on transit people tend not to notice 

 everyone follows the street lights to cross intersections and streets 

 do not order togo or carryout and sit downloiter in the store if you want to sit down please say youre eatingdrinking in the store when an employee asks most of the time for togo orders the staff have to give you portable containers for your items rather than glasses or dishes reserved for sitdown customers

 some sit down cafes will have a return station it could just have a counter or rack to put the finished tray and items on andor have a small disposal area for certain items youve eaten

 this may seem obvious but do not pick up pose and take pictures with fruitsitems you havent purchased from small vendors i saw a group of tourists do this to a man in jeju and he was not amused to say the least    

 sometimes people will stare especially older folks however because i pass as korean it did not affect me much on public transit its not very loud and i saw most people stare at their phone or the floor in front of them  

language 

 definitely learn how to say basic korean words like please thank you sorry excuse me this and numbers up to like 5 probably you will need to use them like when ordering food or purchasing items 

 maybe not as necessary but if you like certain drinks or food i would learn how to say them in korean  

time

 there are certain days off and holidays just be mindful when you are planning to go out for the day that the place you are going to isnt closed

 breakfast may be tricky since a lot of places are not open until 10001100 am but if you are need a snack drink or random things the convenience stores in korea are the best 

foods

 delivery apps like coupang is great for trying out different foods without any pressure to order but i believe you need a korean number to order 

 gwangjang market and similar markets where multiple vendors sell the same type of thing in my opinion do not have the best korean foods however theyre were not bad there are better food vendors at these markets other markets you kind of have to find them though usually therell be a line of koreans lol

other

 there are bidets on some toilets and a few places dont like to flush toilet paper down because of weak water pressure and a have bin for its disposal so prepare to use a bidet lol

 there are a lot of stairs if you are using the subway frequently keep to the right side unless you are in a rush

 clothing stores generally dont have bigger sizes but i went to the main flagship romistory store which carried kind of basic feminine clothing that is more korean style i went there twice and wish i could go back lol 

 if you love korean makeup skincare etc oh my god there are so many oliveyoungs in seoul im talking two on one street or across from each other it is much cheaper buying in korea than global sites and they have sales and promotions on usually on offer

korea,what are the expectations reality and regret you face when travelling to korea,im wondering what you were expecting when you went to korea the reality that was different from what you expected and regrets you had while travelling to korea
korea,korea travel tips ive learned from multiple trips,"seoul is one of my favorite cities in the world and i could not wait to go back once restrictions started to lift ive been there three times and have honed in on some general tips that i hope are helpful to this sub

background i visited seoul in may 2019 and then again in october 2019 i just came back from a 15 day trip in september split between seoul third time and busan first time i used to travel frequently for both business and leisure especially to asia so theres very little culture shock anymore im a mid30s woman from la who looks korean but does not speak the language which earned me a lot of disappointed looks 

not going to cover covidrelated entryexit tips given how quickly those have evolved this year all i will say is this the man who performed my swab touched a place inside me i didnt know existed and i never want to feel again 

travel

 purchase a tmoney or cashbee card when you land at the airport for public transportation funds both cards work in seoul and busan across subways and busses youll need cash to top off the cards public transportation is cheap clean and efficient in both seoul and busan
 dont bother with a wifi egg everywhere has wifi i have a google pixel and googlefi so i didnt need to go anything once landing but others have recommended getting a sim card at the airport 
 kakao taxi came in clutch given the language barrier enter the address and request a ride you can use kakao t without a korean number just select the option to pay after the ride uber exists but pales in comparison 
 taxi light colors are reversed if you see a taxi with a red light on that means its vacant green is occupied or reserved and blue is off duty 
 download kakao or naver for food and directions not google due to data mapping privacy some addresses in google are straight up inaccurate
 unless youre traveling during chuseok you can purchase ktx tickets the day of edit ive been corrected try to buy tickets ahead of timeyou can go to a ktx station and purchase in person for a future date if you run into online credit card issues like i did no need to splurge on first classits not worth it
 plenty of luggage storage at essentially every subway station but almost all hotels will hold your bags for you at check out 

language

 use a translation app like papago or google translate to get the hangul of what youre looking for and then plug that into kakao or naver for recommendations for example typing in bossam didnt net any decent result but  did 
 i found that papago is better for written translations whereas google translate is better for speechtotranscribe we ended up making fast friends with some older gentleman at a pocha one night in busan using only papago google translate and increasingly exaggerated hand gestures thanks to soju to communicate 
 i used the google translate lens to translate menus not the most amazing translations but i got enough of the gist to order 
 seoul speaks and understands far more english than busan 
 dont be a shitasslearn some basic korean some helpful phrases
    annyeong haseyo  hello
    gamsahamnida  thank you
    ne  yes
    aniyo  no
    yeongeo halsu isseoyo  can you speak english
    mian hamnida  sorry
    du myeong iyo  two people
    yeogiyo  jogiyo  here  there to get attention in a restaurant
    masisseoyo  delicious
 that being said korean romanization is confusing in korean s is pronounced as the sh sound so masisseoyo  mahsheesohyo the first time i visited it took 5 min for my cab driver to understand i wanted to go to sinsadong because i didnt pronounce it shinsadong wish i had kakaotaxi that time korean sounds best if youre basically speedrunning through the phrase 

food  drinks  activities

 most businesses and restaurants dont open until 11am at the earliest some dont open until 56pm seoul comes to life at night if you find yourself up early go get a bowl of soup found that theres a strong overlap between 24h restaurants and seollungtung spots a coffee and stroll through seoul forest park or gyeongbokgung palace which open earlier in the morning 
 if youre staying at a hotel ask concierge to help book reservations i really wanted to try the hanwoo beef omakase in the basement speakeasy of born  bred but they only took reservations over the phone in korean and spots fill up about a month in advance i emailed ryse hotel in hongdae a week before my flight and they helped me secure a reservation within hours 
 so much turnover for businesses in korea dont be disappointed if a place is gone or operating hours have changed from whats posted online which is often time not entirely accurate i stumbled into an amazing vinyl bar during my first trip to seoul in may 2019 when i returned five months later it was gone during this most recent trip i looked up a highly rated soondubu restaurant in busan that had reviews as recent as two months prior but found a fresh pile of rubble upon arrival 
 unless youre going to a western style cocktail bar you will likely need to order food with your drinks this is called anju some places only require one dish for the table but others especially pochas expect you to order one dish per person on the plus side these businesses arent in the practice of quickly turning over tables so you can hang and munch for a while
 pochas and food stalls only take cash most other restaurants take card had no issue with visa but ive seen amex cause problems 
 nachos just mean tortilla chips youll see nachos and cheese on some pub menus dont order it 
 sweet onion powder is inexplicably on everything including nachos  

miscellaneous

 if youre looking for a toilet just go to any subway station plentiful and decently clean 
 carry tissues and hand sanitizer at all times many bathrooms lacked soap or had communal soap bars hork 
 korea is incredibly safe people leave their cell phones and purses when going to the restroom or to reserve seats i even saw a rolex on a bar stool when someone stepped outside for a smoke with that being said dont be carelessyoure still in a big city 
 stand on the right side of the escalator step to the left side if youre walking updown 
 despite the level of organization and efficiency for escalators this is not the case for sidewalks its a chaotic game of chicken and youll run into at least half a dozen people who dont bother to look up from their phones 

happy to give some cityspecific recommendations if anyone is interested i generally avoid major tourist attractions like n seoul tower and lotte world unless theres some other interesting draw im food and drink motivated and dont care for clubbing but love a good nightlife"

korea,traveling to korea heres some advice ,"please note this is my experience and opinions

1 transportation 
public transportation is great here
i used public transportation in busan and seoul didnt really have an issue except on one day where they closed some parts of the city for a marathon 
theres usually a bus every 10 minutes
dont forget to tap in and out of the bus

uber and kakao t
i used the uber app way more than kakao t
you can select pay in person if you want to pay in cash or using a prepaid debit card
if using cash i gave the exact amount so i am unsure if they offer change 
the cost of using uberkakao isnt too bad but if theresa traffic the price does go up


if you are traveling with multiple large luggages please make your life easier and call use a taxi
at the airport you would usually have to cross the street to get a jumbo taxi  4050 usd 
hotels will also help call a taxi for you on the way back to the airport just let them know in advance

2 payment methods
i used cash credit cards and wowpass
i loved all three and if i were to come back i would still use all three payment methods

cash transportation tmoney reload and uber street food and light shopping

credit cards transportation uber shopping and restaurants
make sure to press korea when buying stuff i chose americausd and got charged 4 even though my cards have do not have foreign exchange fees


wowpass currency exchange transportation public and uber restaurants and shopping 
pros 
the currency exchange rate with wowpass is actually great better than most banks 
only had to use one card for shopping and transportation 
can check balance of the card and tmoney on the app
cons
not enough machines in the city 


3 esim or pocket wifi 
i reserved the airport package with wowpass and received an esim
the data is great didnt have any issues with it
there is wifi almost everywhere you go 

i chose esim over pocket wifi because i didnt want to carry another item in my bag and worry about losing it and having to charge it 

you also get a korean number havent had to use it other than getting my pictures sent to me through text 

4 other things
be prepared to walk and stand
so wear the right shoes 

if youre planning on taking your drink to go you wont be able to bring it on public transportation 
so chug that drink lol 

dont do too much in one day plan realistically
also dont underestimate jet lag and traveling to your accommodation on the first day 

cultural differences 
dont get offended if people accidentally shove or push you and they dont say sorryexcuse me im from the us and this was a shocking experience

bathroom
they dont have toilet seat covers 
prepare to squat or wipe down the seat
they have signs not to flush the toilet paper 


prices
shopping and eating is a hit or miss with the prices
its usually about the same price as back in america 
even convenience stores are kind of pricey
not sure if it was in the area i was in 


if i remember anything else ill edit this post
if you have any advice please comment below "

korea,arrowhead hasnt changed since magicka,"all info regarding magicka is from this article from 13 years ago written by pilestedt himself detailing how the development for magicka went a lot of his comments sure seem familiar

httpswwwgamedevelopercombusinesspostmortemarrowheadgamestudiosimagickaihttpswwwgamedevelopercombusinesspostmortemarrowheadgamestudiosimagickai

magicka

1 estimates 6 months with 5 full time devs
2 actually took 24 months and 8 full time devs  some part timers
3 as magicka was developed to be a niche game it was easy to filter and dismiss incorrect feedback from certain wellestablished people that knew the industry better  all of these suggestions directly interfered with the main design philosophies at arrowhead and wouldve diluted our vision for magicka and made it a carbon copy of so many other titles
4 as the game went live on steam a huge number of people bought it the first day the number of severe bugs and crashes became painfully obvious  to the point that a problemfree game of magicka became a joke
5 due to our milestone plan we had this mentality of having to pull together this mentality resulted in not only our actually pulling together but also our shunning existing technology putting too much effort in things that didnt matter and just plain grinding  mmo style
6 we instead took it upon ourselves to work overtime for several consecutive weeks to catch up for previous misjudgments and attempt to reach new impossible milestones
7 unfortunately we didnt have a plan at least not a plan that had any reasonable way of tracking how we were doing where we were or how much we had left all that existed was a timeline on the whiteboard with numbered weeks associated with levels and features if a level slipped past the week to which it was assigned we would just consider it good enough  even though it was missing crucial gameplay features
8 sometimes in the middle of development we realized the game was nowhere as fun as it had been in the prototype stages and not even close to what we aimed for the first time we had experienced such a problem doubt filled the studio and it caused our productivity to decrease
9 regarding advice from the gaming industry we failed miserably at heeding their advice it was almost as if we were told about the exact position of all the mines in a minefield and we still like some sort of imbeciles were compelled to step on them
10 this tendency of having to experience mistakes before learning from them kept haunting us throughout the entire development process
11 other than that we have established a functional pipeline for creating new content for magicka even though the game engine isnt really crafted to handle it

helldivers 2

1 estimates 3 years with a studio of 30ish
2 actually takes 8 years ending with 100 size studio
3 what fans loved vs the vision
4 game crashes glitches and multiplayer aspects breaking are almost guaranteed at this point
5 overcomplicated game design and focus on player nerfs 200 overlapping systems
6 were at this step now fixing previous misjudgments
7 the whole well have a plan within 60 days speech
8 productivity decrease
9 completely ignoring player feedback regarding weapon nerfs
10 same as 9
11 hd2s is not crafted to handle more additions

theyve massively grown in size and budget but havent changed for the better in over a decade missing deadlines ignoring feedback making constant mistakes not having a plan theyre using the same game engine they had issues with 13 years ago and now expect it to do so much more

now theyre making all the same mistakes as well as new ones i dont know why id expect anything to change at this point the games stability is falling apart and youve got ah employees on social media talking about all the cool new features theyre working on theyve got new employees trying to patch nearly decade old spaghetti code with 200 overlapping systems

meanwhile by 24hour peak steam rating in one week helldivers 2 has dropped 18 places to end up at 75 if it loses another 30 it will be off the top 100 and be underneath cookie clicker and space marine 2 isnt even out yet were on track to see sub10k total players in the mornings and sub30k highs within a few days"

korea,i took my family on a car free vacation my wife cried,"i have always despised cars and loved public transportation early in my adult life i was stationed in korea and often used their public transportation and bullet trains ive been chasing that high ever since 

i lived in dc for around a year in 2012 and again found their public transportation immaculate and i did not own a car the entire time i went everywhere without issue 

i moved back to my home state in texas with virtually no public transportation and met my wife six lane stroads no bike infrastructure and they barely implemented a new bus system but did not reach our neighborhood despite us living in dense housing 

it always ate at me and was so inefficient and nonsensical i tried to convince my wife who has only traveled outside of texas a few handful of times that we should consider moving to a larger city with at least some public transportation it was foreign to her and she gets social anxiety sometimes 

she had a medical incident where one of her eyes just froze up and was unresponsive after seeing some neurologist and wearing an eye patch it eventually returned to normal however she still struggles to drive at night and sometimes gets blurry vision 

it kind of clicked with her when we were on one of our several debates of car free living i explained i was just concerned for her and her safety while driving that if it got worse or she had another episode while driving she would be at risk 

i was able to get the time to take my family to dc we never once got in a car we used the metro buses or walked yeah it was hot and sometimes the bus was late because you know  cars but the metro was reliable and we planned a lot of our trip around metro access i would have used the capital bike share but our kid is not old enough to ride alone but did adore the bike infrastructure dc had we even took the marc to baltimore for lunch and some attractions then took the acela back to dc just to prove how easy travel was with proper rail infrastructure 

at one point on the trip while riding the metro she started to cry convinced how travel wasnt scary how efficient it was as well easy to use she felt like she had wasted so much time arguing about moving to an area like it 

not saying were packing up to move next week or even moving to dc in particular but places like the ne corridor chicago minneapolis denver are now on my families top destinations to start a new chapter in

korea,ive been travelling in korea for the past 16 days and these were the kpop songs i heard the most in shops and restaurants,"1 nxde and tomboy by far gets played the most every single day i hear these two songs so many times 

2 hype boy and ditto are close third and fourth we went to a fancy twostar michelin restaurant and they were playing the piano version of these two songs i only heard attention once though 

3 not every day but love dive after like a few times too 

other comments
 other songs i heard a couple of times aespas various title tracks glitch mode maniac and sneakers 

 i only heard bts played in the really really touristy areas sometimes its so random and unrelated its hilarious like its a shop in the mountains selling korean souvenirs and wood carvings and they are blasting dynamite and dna 

 all blackpink songs i heard were in skincare and cosmetic shops 

 shops and restaurants usually dont play all those dance songs back to back usually after a dance song the next two or three songs are slower and sadder ballads that i dont recognise or ed sheeran or justin bieber 

 most heard english song was 2002 by annemarie 

 fearless is obviously a song written about these girls who wear miniskirts in zero degree thats why they are fearless but need to get away 

 my ult group is got7 and unsurprisingly their songs were never played in shops

 my husbands love is twice and they were not played either on day 14 he heard the beginning of talk that talk when walking past a shop he got so excited he grabbed me to stop and listen

 hikr was an unforgettable kpop experience i dont know if the staff are always that fun and energetic if you can do random dance go and dance with the staff there theyre so much fun"
korea,i just spent two months in china dont believe the ccp reporting 21 youth unemployment it is definitely way way higher,"so im a mandarinspeaking asian dude from texas this is all anecdotal so this is only my firsthand observations feelings are useless in trading you are a moron if you trade off a story versus hard facts i was in beijing for a wedding then was a tourist through chengdu and harbin and various villages in between

first locals are freaked out the ccp is so embarrassed youth unemployment is over 21 that they will stop reporting the number starting the next month for reference places like japan south korea and the us are at 5 to 7 youth unemployment uk at 10 eu at 14 twenty one puts china in the same territory as fucking lebanon heard many an angry rant against the government by middleage and older parents behind closed doors talking about how their adult kids are unemployed even with a c9 university degree i met many many food cart vendors and meituan food delivery app dudes on ebikes who just graduated from a top school this on top of all the quiet quitting and lying flat people i met who are just giving up and not looking for steady work several parents told me how the old cushy government jobs for grads are drying up because cities are all teetering on bankruptcy due to the growthatallcosts spending and debt of the past 20 years

second these shady fucks are not reporting unemployed migrant workers from rural areas theres got to be millions of these people i thought migrants were reported after the ccp revamped their labor reporting standards in 2019 but the business owners and university faculty i met and talked to said it is all bullshit there is no way to track them i stayed at a friends flat near central chengdu and every morning there were hundreds of migrant day laborers at the truck depot across the street waiting for trucks and vans to drive up looking for cheap labor shit was wild there would be literally fistfights over who would pile into each truck reminded me of the honduran mexican and salvadorian migrants back in dallas who line up near home depots looking for day work sans violence the day labor dudes i talked to in those mobs in chengdu and beijing were almost all former construction workers who are now doing day work or gig jobs because all the construction jobs are gone thanks to the imploding real estate market see evergrande bankruptcy they told me the day labor crowds were easily 3x bigger right after covid but the work was so rare that folks packed up and returned to their villages when they ran out of money multiple that a couple hundred times who knows how many unemployed ppl arent being counted

another big problem no one is talking about that i noticed  china made working construction over 50 illegal so now theres millions up on millions of people over that age trying to fill other service jobs even before covid thanks to the one child policy and nonexistent government benefits there arent the large family safety nets that other asian countries have so i could see with my own eyes many older folks with no savings already falling through the cracks

shit is fucked ive been to china a few times since 2000 and this is the first time i could see and hear deep structural stress on the economy and society china has always felt like the wild west to me because theres just so many people there living on top of each other that everyone just looks out for themselves even before covid i rarely saw common courtesies like the waiting in line and not being rude to strangers that selfishness still exists but is now on hyperdrive since people dont have easy access to jobs anymore im curious how xi is going to keep people in line when the wheels come off completely thank you for coming to my ted talk


edit lol someone referred me to reddit cares for this post dont worry i dont plan on ever travelling back to china i decided awhile ago this would be my last trip i have zero family there and the friend i stayed with in chengdu is a nonchinese expat i love chinese people and culture that is why i kept going back but you dont need to be in china to exclusively experience it"

asian men are the most misogynistic sexist and chauvinistic asian men abuse and treat women the worst which is why the 4b movement exists  anti am propaganda

well facts on the ground and testimony from neutral observers non asian women from around the world are providing evidence to the contrary there are many other factors in the argument destroying those statements but those videos and many more like them provide a huge piece in contradicting them

if the above statements were true then there were would actually be enormously more complaints and reports of sexual harassment abuse attempted rape etc by both local and foreign women against asian men and that is simply not the case in fact the complete opposite appears to be true

those women describe in amazement the ability to enjoy those asian cities night lives and actually walk around by themselves and go home late at night feeling completely safe without fearing danger and harm for their safety in contrast to major cities in the usa uk western europe and other parts of the world where it is well known and documented that it is very unsafe for women to wander alone late at night where they can fall prey to real predatory men who can cause them serious harm

ironically too there are many countries and regions around the world where due to religionold cultural customs etc the men there really do hold extremely misogynistic sexist and chauvinistic beliefs and commit horrific and heinous violence against women on a societal scale

yet the anti am sources who propagate these lies against am bobas lus xm haters all with ulterior motives and negative am agendas never call out the men in the previous paragraph but instead focus all their vitriol against am

but thank goodness there is growing evidence we can use to counter these lies"

korea,during the 90s north korea leader kim jongll and his son and future leader kim jongun used fake brazilian passports to travel to disneyland,"these passports were obtained at an embassy in prague which allowed the family to travel without suspicion

brazilian passports were ideal because during the 19th and 20th centuries thousands of asian immigrants had moved to south america

as a result it was not an odd thing to see a person of asian descent from brazil

korea,is travel to north korea ethical,"no judgment to anyone who wants to go or has gone i have been researching north korea for a long time now and i too am extremely curious 

but i cant help but wonder is travel there ethical

knowing that people there are forced to do the jobs theyre assigned no choice but to wait on you and serve you for very little pay 

and these are people who have very few human rights granted youre going to be in the more privileged areas but even the most privileged citizens are trapped and have no choices

and of course theres the argument about supporting the regime with your money is supporting the good and bad they do 

i havent decided if i believe its ethical or not but i am definitely leaning more towards unethical i just cant imagine supporting it in any way 

id love to hear from everyone who is for and against it and how youd do it ethically if youre on the fence 

thanks

korea,as a european would you prefer to travel to india or to north korea,which one sounds more appealing to you or less bad as an alternate perspective north korea has the issue where you could get in deep trouble if you offend the government the wrong way while india has a reputation for hygiene pollution and female safety issues when you take into account these downsides which one sounds preferable to you or at least less risky

ive made it back from korea not only that i did so without any reactions and no close calls thank you very much once again for all of your help i had a lovely trip and the cuisine looked amazing from a distance

for anyone wondering heres how i handled it i brought enough premade food to make it through the entire trip due to customs regulations no meats were allowed and as stated i am allergic to nuts so i brought poptarts and triscuits which are both heavily processed and they didnt have any objection to i did eventually make it to a grocery store and bought some fresh things to have a little variety i had confirmed in advance that korea had the same labeling requirements as the us in terms of the allergens in the food and possibility of cross contamination  google lens did a great job of translating the labels for me i did not risk eating at any restaurants 

all in all i had a great trip im so grateful to everyone who took the time to read and comment on this post thank you very much 

 edit 823 745am est

thank you very much to everyone who commented i really didnt expect so many replies i deeply appreciate your willingness to help share knowledge and advise me on the best ways to protect myself

to reiterate i was already planning to makebring all of my meals myself but i wanted to see if there were precautions i could take to eat out safely the answer is a resounding no rest assured that i will take all of your advice very seriously and strictly avoid eating anything i have not prepared myself

i really do appreciate your help ill make sure to add another update when i get home safely thanks to all of you expect that around 918

original post follows

i need to travel to korea in a few weeks for a 1 week conference im very excited about it but i have been doing some research into how to handle allergies and the consensus seems to be that you cant the conference will be in busan so i am hoping that the touristheavy location will make it easier i do not speak any korean at all

i have a severe life threatening allergy to nuts peanuts fish and shellfish any amount of these even a trace amount or cross contamination could trigger a lifethreatening response  im planning to bring or prepare all of my meals myself but i would like to be prepared in case i am invited to a social event or some other circumstance requires me to purchase food from a restaurant here are the precautions i plan to take

1 two epipens
2 a laminated card with this text in korean

 i have life threatening allergies to tree nuts peanuts fish and shellfish even a small amount in my food can kill me for example if you add shrimp flavor to your food i might die be very careful while preparing please tell me you understand and can make something safe 

which according to google translate is

                                      

3 a medical alert bracelet in case i am found unresponsive

any other ideas or modifications to the above would be most appreciated thanks in advance"
korea,updates on johnny somali,"im sure everyone in this sub knows who this guy is but are just unaware of the latest updates heres the latest update

hes currently being charged for obstruction of business apologies its not justice its obstruction of business which is usually a fine  restraint order the reason why hes not allowed to leave is because hes currently being investigated for drug charges one count of assault charge and several sexual harassment charges we dont know how much evidence or how many victims came forward but because of this investigation he is barred from leaving korea in the meantime

there are still a lot of korean streamers looking for his whereabouts to boost their platform  anger towards his action to the comfort women statue what people dont know is that there are korean mafia members who are searching for him as well what they plan to do is unknown but i doubt its like what the japanese streamers did which was just make him apologize youre famous to the point where when you first entered no one in korea really cared as of now you have your own korean cafe wiki page detailing almost every incident you have been involved in korea httpsnamuwikiweca1b0eb8b8820ec868ceba790eba6achttpsnamuwikiweca1b0eb8b8820ec868ceba790eba6ac

theres talks amongst korean government officials who want to make an example out of him most are parliament members who are up for reelection  want to boost their approval rate most are using him in their reelection propaganda by just adding more fuel to the fire theres popular korean political channels making videos of you now to boost their viewership httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvn8bdrp11e5mhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvn8bdrp11e5m

there is currently a live petition for him to be arrested hes also being prosecuted yes prosecuted because they have sufficient evidence for making illegal pornography specifically deepfakes httpsnewsmtcokrmtviewphpno2024110118412316470httpsnewsmtcokrmtviewphpno2024110118412316470

to johnny somali if he does end up reading this

this is not any country this is korea im not the proudest in terms of the laws the country has and where moral standards have been in the courtroom but if theres one thing im sure of when given the opportunity they will make an example out of someone that has united a country in anger

why we as koreans are angry

we quite frankly dont care about the incidence you did at the convenience store or you slapping that phone or what you did with the presidents picture quite frankly the president has enough critiques amongst the general public we dont care that you were a nuisance everywhere you went what we do care is where you showed the japanese rising sun flag and your actions towards the comfort women statue what you did was poke at a painful past in our history for your amusement httpwwwsportivomedianetnewsarticleviewhtmlidxno13563httpwwwsportivomedianetnewsarticleviewhtmlidxno13563

my suggestion would have been for you to apologize but seeing your latest live stream you double downed on your position by portraying yourself as the victim instead of admitting what you did was wrong with sincerity you have already lost the opportunity to apologize oh and the us embassy talk they wont help you and arent really allowed to do anything they will make sure you receive your rights and counsel but thats about it the crimes you committed here while in korea are here to stay korea isnt like japan where they just ban you no the country will make sure you pay for your crimes either by jail sentence or heft fines and then deport you you better hope you dont get a jail sentence because news travels fast about what people did inside the jail cells

i guess my current suggestion is  to get a good lawyer if you can get one no high profile lawyer will take it because of public backlash no other lawyers will take it because of the low percentage chance of winning the case since foreigners vs national prosecution always sides with the national public counsel will most likely suggest you show repentance to receive lighter sentence andor smaller fines

as one crime film famously said the united states missed you japan gave you away israel lost you were going to fry you

new update
hes been slapped with a disturbance of peace charge according to the law if korean prosecution were to go to the full extent he could be seeing up to 10 years in prison also a group of former udt korean special operation force members are looking for him he claims hes in a us army base he isnt there are three us military bases in korea two of them are too far out of seoul and all of them are off limits for civilians let alone a nuisance to enter hes currently hiding somewhere near seoul but is afraid to go out due to him being recognized since what he did is pretty much well known to the korean community also he didnt apologize in his latest instagram post he instead photoshopped himself onto emperor hirohitos face and posted it on his story

update 113 
hes still in korean and confirmed to have claimed that comfort women were prostitutes also its been noted the drug charge in itself is 10 years so the combined sentence if found guilty could well be over 10 years latest updatehttpsyoutubeaux5lwqjewsivmfx2naxbtef8jd4 also heres the big fight everyone is talking about the big fight between johnny somalianother racist vs korean streamershttpswwwyoutubecomlivek2jdbtqxylgsiue3dpl99gvhjzen6 also the deep fake charges were apparently him trying to prove he had a korean girlfriend or some kind of fling happening so he was using an ai to portray that illusion hence the deep fake charge its not sexual deep fake charge that koreas been seeing lately in the news but its still a deep fake so he will still probably be charged with the same law also apparently the girl is an accomplice httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxkzcdjux2eu the han river part was real but we may not know the full story regardless shes suing under the deep fake law so even if shes lying its most likely the court will still rule in favor of her weird but the police are investigating this charge httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxesrpkxuwoo this is more about who the girl in the video is basically johnny you have a lot of charges


for people saying he already fled the country no he didnt theres no travel record indicating he left the country hes still in korea currently so called bounty hunters are trying to locate his whereabouts meanwhile the korean authorities are still probing into his deep fake charge as they have a key witness  sufficient evidence to build a case against him confirmed charges are ai deepfake charge  obstruction of business  disturbance of peace charge drug  assault  sexual harrassment charges are still pending investigation

update 114
korean parliament reviewed the johnny somali streams including the comfort women one one member described it as devastating and another as damaging the reputation of korea most parliament members agreed with the sentiment that his streams have severly damaged koreas reputation a member said that a swift action needs to be taken to discourage other potential tourists from ever doing the similar actions

additionally more korean youtube streamers as well as even more netizens have teamed up this morning to hunt johnny there was a conference today that was broadcasted amongst the original streamers who were involved in the scuffle apologizing for their violent act because this isnt the side of korea they want to show to the international world they seem committed to still search for johnny but in the meantime they have filed a complaint to the korean government for failing to act towards the national interest there is also widespread criticism amonst korean online cafes toward the government for failing to act

currently there are two different korean mafia groups actively searching for johnny while one is unconfirmed one that is confirmed is from the seongbuk district near the miari area who are asking citizens who have seen him to call a number for a cash reward the exact amount as well as the nature of the reward is unknown they are currently outsourcing their search work to try to find him as well as his friend hank they dont want interaction with the police so if the police do find him first its presumed they probably wont take further action

he was rumoured to have been staying at his friends hank apartment a lone streamer searching for johnny said he heard both johnny and hanks voice in the apartment and the streamer and his friends are currently staking out to see the latest development this is unconfirmed as of now httpswwwyoutubecomwatchviwszdcd0fak

sexual harrassment charges are confirmed as police have acquired the video of him and his friends asking korean girls two of them being minors if they can perform sexual acts i will not say in detail what he said because quite frankly its quite disgusting  one of it was even streamed live during one of his broadcast while the other was a report that was filed the authenticity of the video is still be tested by digital crimes division police are also in the process of obtaining cctv footages of areas johnny has streamed to see events that have transpired this has been confirmed

as for the deepfake charge that charge may not dropped even though the original suer has expressed that she no longer wishes to press charges httpsxcomteamftofficialstatus1853404933040599507 she did press charges originally this from her stream doing so httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv1j6cme1gzgo the reason why the charges may noe be dropped is because of the revised law in september 26 of this year which states that regardless of purposes productions and distribution of synthetic materials can still be punished not confirmed if the charges will be dropped but he has a lot more to worry about than the deepfake particularly the drug and sexual harrassment charges 

because a lot of johnnys foreign friends are not in korea it is possible that hank and johnny are the only ones out of their team that are still in korea hank is confirmed to be a bisexual pedophile who admitted to paying young korean boys to have sex in the past its being guessed amongst seachers that the police do know where johnny and his friend is staying but they are not going to release the information to the public for johnnys safety also previously i was unable to verify that his passport was actually confiscated but its been confirmed his passport was confiscated when the mokpo police took him into custody this also confirms the initial claim that he has not left korea even though he claims he did he is still in korea hiding out as of this time he has raised 22 cents through ebegging 

114 update
wow im honestly updating so much on this degen because hes just doing too much hes now confirmed to have claimed theres no dokdo island he said its takeshima island also for people dming for video of him saying comfort women are prositutes here is the clip httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvi0xzjpdcbsy 

115 update
so theres been some other updates a lot of seoul taxi drivers are aware of johnny and his actions and theres a common agreement to not give him ride or to report him to the police if they do give him a ride was riding a taxi and we were discussing with the driver about the johnny case and he said yes we all know him he shouldnt be doing that in our country we were just talking about him yesterday at the  taxi driver restraunt and also another group of nonstreamers actively looking for him its a group of former  korean marine corp members they were spotted near a park in mokpo asking passing civilians if theyve seen johnny theres a few other small groups and a common sentiment is that the police is protecting johnny by not revealing his location assuming the police know about johnnys whereabouts

1110 update
httpsyoutubexspa9wcvltesikkjn56qkcatvoxv
it is not up to but definitely over 10 years in prison
 obstruction of business disturbance of peace assault drug charges and sexual harrassment of minors are what he is being charged with  under investigation for he is currently in the no fly list still despite reports saying he already left  hes also been hit with multiple trespassing charges as well as an additional charge for vandalism of public property there is also a harrassment charge when he made rather degrading remarks to a woman while on public transit the apology although received nicely by the korean public doesnt change the course of action the police and prosecution will take most have seen what he did in japan and there is widespread criticism of korean streamers who met up with him to discuss the apology and seemingly accepting it 

there was no mention of dropping the deepfake charge so the police and prosecution is still looking into it the victim has reportedly stopped pursuing the case

1111 update
despite johnnys insisting that he hasnt been charged with assault and threatening legal actions if posts like these arent taken down he has been confirmed to have been charged for assault hes also been charged with obstruction of business and to top it off he is still being investigated for all the other charges mentioned above korean nonstreamers are still hunting for him even coining the term golden goblin to describe johnny

1112 edit
httpswwwseattlencomfocus19053googlevignette
just when you thought it couldnt get worse hes being investigated for stalking a streamer reported johnny for stalking no official charges yet as police is still conducting investigation also for people asking when he will be arrested he has been summoned by the prosecution office on charge of obstruction of business other charges could follow soon httpswwwkadonetnewsarticleviewhtmlidxno1275722

final edit
hes been formally indicted with obstruction of business which is sentence of at most 5 years however he wont likely get the 5 years but instead a lighter sentence likely up to 2 years since the store wasnt damaged where there were financial repurcussions like how usually a 5 year sentence is given if he gets a sentence could most likely be a fine if anything if he pleas guilty and shows repentance the deep fake charge is most likely going to be dropped because the victim is no longer pursuing the charge hes still under investigation of sexual harrassment of minors assault and disturbance of peace there was no mention of drug charges as of yesterday evening by both police stations 
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv7s8qsuudtog
the thing with korea is they have a 90 success rate when it comes to convictions basically johnnys screwed it doesnt seem like he will be facing the 10 year sentence that was previously reported in multiple news outlets but he will most likely be facing jail time andor hefty fine during his jailtime the prosecution could indict him on other charges once those investigations are concluded 
funny thing is johnny somali asked police to help because he was getting beaten up and the police went to his location and concluded he wasnt beaten up even those theres clips circulating the beating up  httpsyoutubebadsa66pnjmsifqu8zu2g8p1ns3p3
also i dont know why this got removed this is johnny and his friends being a predator httpsyoutubekkdxqjuxa0siwmsnowwdywn4kwgn"
korea,visiting korea made me feel like most americans are fucked when it comes to food options,"i really dont blame most of the us for being obese especially in smaller towns

even in the us i used to live in a small town and lost like 10 of my body weight simply by moving to a city with healthier takeout and grocery options every time i go back to my small town or travel to even somewhere like denver for work i literally cant escape all the extra sugars and other loaded garbage in food even healthy options

sure sure sure you can cook at home but most of us end up not doing it when we work full time and have to manage work kids etcetera most of us have to work some of us need second jobs

so i come to korea to visit family members and its not like koreans are necessarily more disciplined and making home cooked meals all the time koreans eat out all the time they just have fresher foods healthier meal options all at affordable prices and they dont have to drive 30 minutes to find a place to eat all and these people as busy as fuck

its not like korean food is inherently healthier than traditional american cuisine which is diverse its just that most americans dont have access to how americans 100 years ago ate anymore theyre stuck with junk food and massproduce franchises everywhere i am convinced our food supply is just fucked by big agriculture trying to pump sugars and corn syrups in everything just because they can and then the american palate changes to keep expecting unnecessarily sweeter and saltier garbage even the food pyramid is bullshit with a lot of lobbying and propaganda behind it these us corporates are throwing public health under the bus in the name of profit

korea,unpopular opinion its cheaper to travel to japan nowadays than to south korea,"i travelled to japan last march for two weeks and south korea 2 months after dun ko narealize na cheaper sa japan kesa sa sk food shopping pasalubong and transpo are cheaper in japan 

accommodations and flight tickets ang nagpapamahal sa japan pero pag nakascore ka ng piso sale or promo naku sobrang keri na yung 4050k mo for two weeks 

currently in south korea ulit right now and sobrang mahal ng food and transpo siguro dahil ang baba din ng japanese yen ngayon kaya nacocompare ko 

sa mga nakapagjapan and south korea na same thoughts din ba kayo haha"

korea,travelling to japan and south korea as a solo black man how safe is it,"im a 37 year old british black man from london who is planning to travel to japan and south korea for 11 days roughly in 2024 always wanted to go so looking forward to this trip im a father of 2 boys and taking my first solo trip without my wife for the first time in like forever ive chosen to go to these two areas not just because i love the culture but also as a black man it seemed from my research one of the few safest countries for people of colour with other areas being quite more negative to people who look like wont name all but particularly parts of america australia brazil europe etc 

i will be travelling into seoul first visiting the areas in and around busan and jeju island for 6 days before heading to japan  visiting tokyo osama and okinhawa for 6 days too any ethnic travellers who have been how did you find your experience and was it safe i know i will get the random looks stares finger pointing and the odd secret picture being taken but outside of this is there anything else i need to consider also

 anyone else planning to go around this time and possibly meet up or if not anyone who has been and can offer some tips on best places to go ive already got a rough itinerary so any ideas will be welcome"

korea,my adult son is missing somewhere in asia,"edit  update my son is okay i received a whatsapp message from him today wishing me a merry christmas  it was simply a christmas miracle 
he has been a very remote areas and was unable to send messages 

i wanted to thank everyone for all their help and support i really appreciate all of you



my adult son travel to asia he left in may and we know he was in seoul south korea then headed to thailand the embassy in thailand said he was only there for a few days it is possible that he travel to loas vietnam or cambodia 
he always kept in touch when he was traveling and we have a very good relationship when he first left he would contact us all the time and then all of a sudden none of the whatsapp messages are going through we are extremely concerned that something has happened weve had no information communications with him since august and the messages are not going through 
 i have a few questions if he was in the hospital and or ended up in jail for any reason do the governments over there have to contact the us embassy to let them know since he is the united states citizen ive been in touch with our local government and im not getting anywhere 
does anyone have any legitimate private investigator services that they suggest do you think the interpol could help
 is there anything else i can do to try to find out where he is
 we just believe that something has definitely happened and he needs our help and he is traveling alone "

korea,traveling with filipina gf to japan and south korea worried about immigration at departure,"im planning on traveling to japan and from there to south korea in a 12 day trip together with my filipina girlfriend and ive heard a lot of stories about immigration being very strict about filipinas leaving the country i was wondering if any of you fellow foreigners had any experience with this and advice to make this trip a smooth process we are currently processing tourist visa but im worried about some border control ruining our trip when we are at the airport 

some context
i myself have visa free entry to japan and south korea from eu i will be paying the majority of the trip for the both of us we have only dated for a few months and theres not much proof of our relationship besides fb profile we are both in our 20s if that makes any difference shes an employee for a big international corporation making around 3035k a month her mother has a few 100s k php that my girlfriend can borrow a portion of to put in her bank account as proof of her financial situation she has traveled internationally before to malaysia and singapore if by any absurd reason my appearance is something they care about when judging us and our relationship im half filipino not a citizen and have filipino pigmentation

questions
1 should she claim to be a solo traveler at border control or to be traveling with her foreigner boyfriend even though i will be in another lane and since we dont have a lot of physical proof of our relationship i dont like taking photos although i said we will take a few photos to have something to show if required 

2 how much is a good amount for her to have in her bank account as proof of her financial capabilities what other forms of documents would help her case

3 for applying for visa to japan it says it requires itinerary but no mention of ticket will we need to book ticket in advance or can we just write an itinerary i was planning on booking the tickets when the visa is approved since our plan requires synchronizing oneway tickets from phjapansouth koreaph

4 anything to consider leaving from japan to south korea as a filipino we initially just planned to go to japan but i wanted to take advantage of the cheap flights from japan to south korea and want to extend a few days

any other advice or experience is greatly appreciated thank you fellow expats

korea,generation change in terms of popular getawaytravel destinations why does it seem like those born before 196570 prefer china while those under like to go to japankorea,"hi all i was born in hong kong but moved away in the early 90s to new zealand so i could speak daily cantonese and can read hong kongs forums like hkgolden lihkg but not able to write chinese very well  i just recently listened to youtube clips by hostscommentators and one from singjai is a trip down the memory lane for those born in the 1960s or before  they often went to china a lot in the very late 1970s but mainly in the 1980s and not just their parents hometowns but across the whole country

i notice that i havent heard about going to china from my own school friends or my cousins or younger  they will go to japan or korea for weekends away and europe uk and north america if travel further afield but china is very rare  and as an older reddit thread points out many of todays hkers jokingly refer to visiting japan as a trip back to the hometown chinese 

httpswwwredditcomrhongkongcomments1711bxbwhydosomanyhkpeoplesaye8bf94e98489e4b88bwhenvisiting

it runs in my own family as well  i have uncles born in the 1950s to early 60s  they never opted to go to japan but often went to china  while my siblings and cousins go to japan instead  

why is there such a generational difference  i just noticed the chasm is kind of between people born before 1965 and after even a more obvious contrast would be the difference between those born before 1970 and after 70  those older have lots of antipathy towards japan but harbour warm feelings towards china and they often backpacked across china when they were younger and many still travel to china often a lot today while those born after 1970 hardly visit china unless for work but go to japan or korea a lot

thanks"

korea,elon musks secret conversations with vladimir putin,"elon musk the worlds richest man and a linchpin of us space efforts has been in regular contact with russian president vladimir putin since late 2022

the discussions confirmed by several current and former us european and russian officials touch on personal topics business and geopolitical tensions

at one point putin asked the billionaire to avoid activating his starlink satellite internet service over taiwan as a favor to chinese leader xi jinping said two people briefed on the request

musk has emerged this year as a crucial supporter of donald trumps election campaign and could find a role in a trump administration should he win while the us and its allies have isolated putin in recent years musks dialogue could signal reengagement with the russian leader and reinforce trumps expressed desire to cut a deal over major fault lines such as the war in ukraine 

at the same time the contacts also raise potential nationalsecurity concerns among some in the current administration given putins role as one of americas chief adversaries  musk has forged deep business ties with us military and intelligence agencies giving him unique visibility into some of americas most sensitive space programs spacex which operates the starlink service won a 18 billion classified contract in 2021 and is the primary rocket launcher for the pentagon and nasa musk has a security clearance that allows him access to certain classified information

knowledge of musks kremlin contacts appears to be a closely held secret in government several white house officials said they werent aware of them the topic is highly sensitive given musks increasing involvement in the trump campaign and the approaching us presidential election less than two weeks away 

musk didnt respond to requests for comment the billionaire has called criticism from some quarters that he has become an apologist for putin absurd and has said his companies have done more to undermine russia than anything

during his campaign swing through pennsylvania last week musk talked about the importance of government transparency and noted his own access to government secrets i do have a topsecret clearance but id have to say like most of the stuff that im aware ofthe reason they keep it top secret is because its so boring

a pentagon spokesman said we do not comment on any individuals security clearance review or status or about personnel security policy matters in the context of reports about any individuals actions

one person aware of the conversations said the government faces a dilemma because it is so dependent on the billionaires technologies spacex launches vital national security satellites into orbit and is the company nasa relies on to transport astronauts to and from the international space station 

they dont love it the person said referring to the muskputin contacts the person however said no alerts have been raised by the administration over possible security breaches by musk

kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said the only communication the kremlin has had with musk was over one telephone call in which he and putin discussed space as well as current and future technologies 

apart from that he said neither putin nor kremlin officials were holding regular conversations with musk

a spokeswoman for trumps campaign called musk a onceinageneration industry leader and said our broken federal bureaucracy could certainly benefit from his ideas and efficiency

as for putin the spokeswoman continued theres only one candidate in the race that he did not invade another country under and its president trump president trump has long said that he will reestablish his peace through strength foreign policy to deter russias aggression and end the war in ukraine

a bottle of vodka

musk has long had a fascination with russia and its space and rocket programs walter isaacsons biography of musk said the businessman traveled to moscow in 2002 to negotiate the purchase of rockets for his fledgling space program but passed out during a vodkaheavy lunch the sale ultimately failed though his russian hosts gave musk a bottle of vodka with his likeness superimposed on a drawing of mars

the billionaires conversations with putin and kremlin officials highlight his increasing inclination to stretch beyond business and into geopolitics he has met several times and talked business with javier milei of argentina as well as former brazilian president jair bolsonaro whom he defended in an acrimonious online debate 

putin is on a different order of magnitude the russian leader has created an authoritarian system that oversees fraudulent elections and the assassinations of political opponents for which president biden called him a killer with keys to one of the worlds most powerful nuclear arsenals and growing territorial ambitions in europe putin has become the uss chief antagonist

labeling him a despot the treasury department took the unusual step in 2022 of blacklisting him for invading ukraine putting him in the same company with north koreas kim jong un syrian president bashar alassad and alexander lukashenko of belarus 

in october 2022 musk said publicly that he had spoken only once to putin he said on x that the conversation was about space and that it occurred around april 2021 

but more conversations have followed including dialogues with other highranking russian officials past 2022 and into this year one of the officials was sergei kiriyenko putins first deputy chief of staff two of the officials said what the two talked about isnt clear

last month the us justice department said in an affidavit that kiriyenko had created some 30 internet domains to spread russian disinformation including on musks x where it was meant to erode support for ukraine and manipulate american voters ahead of the presidential election 

after the russian invasion in february 2022 musk at first made strong public statements of support for kyiv he posted hold strong ukraine flanked by ukrainian flags on what was then still known as twitter shortly after he jokingly challenged putin to oneonone combat over  the ukrainian language name for the country

he followed up by donating several hundred starlink terminals to ukraine by july some 15000 terminals were providing free internet access to broad swaths of the country destroyed by the russian attacks

later that year musks view of the conflict appeared to change in september ukrainian military operatives werent able to use starlink terminals to guide sea drones to attack a russian naval base in crimea the black sea peninsula moscow had occupied since 2014 ukraine tried to persuade musk to activate the starlink service in the area but that didnt happen the journal has reported

his space company extended restrictions on the use of starlink in offensive operations by ukraine musk said later that he made the move because starlink is meant for civilian uses and that he believed any ukrainian attack on crimea could spark a nuclear war

his moves coincided with public and private pressure from the kremlin in may 2022 russias space chief said in a post on telegram that musk would answer like an adult for supplying starlink to ukraines azov battalion which the kremlin had singled out for the ultraright ideology espoused by some members

later in 2022 musk was having regular conversations with highlevel russians according to a person familiar with the interactions at the time there was pressure from the kremlin on musks businesses and implicit threats against him the person said 

at the same time musk increasingly took to twitter for which he was completing the purchase to say spacex was losing money by funding the operation of the terminals   in october 2022 he asked his tens of millions of followers on x to vote on a pathway to peace that mirrored some aspects of the kremlins offer to ukraine at the time

those conditions included continued russian occupation of crimea and ukrainian neutrality outside of nato he also specified that ukraine should continue allowing the supply of water to crimea an issue that had been an important concern of the kremlin before the war one current and one former intelligence source said that musk and putin have continued to have contact since then and into this year as musk began stepping up his criticism of the us military aid to ukraine and became involved in trumps election campaign

red lines

in the fall of 2022 political scientist ian bremmer founder of new yorkbased consulting firm eurasia group wrote on twitter that musk had told him he had spoken with putin and kremlin officials about ukraine he also told me what the kremlins red lines were he wrote

bremmer wrote in a newsletter to subscribers that musk had relayed to him a message from putin that russia would secure crimea and ukrainian neutrality no matter what and that it would respond to a ukrainian invasion of crimea with a nuclear strike musk said that everything needed to be done to avoid that outcome bremmer wrote

musk has publicly denied he said any of those things to bremmer

in the past year musk and russias interests have increasingly overlapped apart from russias use of x for disinformation and musks outspoken opposition to aid to kyiv ukrainian officials said earlier this year that russian forces occupying the countrys eastern and southern swaths had started using starlink to enable secure communications and extend the range of their drones 

russian troops also began using starlink terminals brought in through third countries at a massive scale undermining one of ukraines few battlefield advantages musk has said on x that to the best of his knowledge no terminals had been sold directly or indirectly to russia and that the terminals wouldnt work inside russia 

pentagon officials have said the military was working with ukraine and starlink to address the issue and described spacex as a great partner in those efforts people familiar with the situation have said controlling who is using starlink in ukraine is difficult 

starlink has said on x that when spacex learns of claims that unauthorized parties are using the service it investigates and can cut off access earlier this year musk gave airtime to putin and his views on the us and ukraine when x carried tucker carlsons twohour interview with the russian leader inside the kremlin in that interview putin said he was sure musk was a smart person

theres no stopping elon musk hes going to do what he thinks he needs to do putin said you need to find some common ground with him you need to search for some ways to persuade him

late last year the kremlin first made the request of musk to not activate starlink over taiwan said a former russian intelligence officer briefed on the situation the request was done as a favor to china he said whom russia was increasingly relying on for trade and to get around sanctions a representative of the chinese embassy in washington said they werent aware of the specifics and couldnt comment 

starlink has never secured permission to offer internet service in taiwan whose government places restrictions on nontaiwanese satellite operators 

taiwan is currently listed as coming soon on a starlink map of where it provides service  as the year progressed musk became more preoccupied with the presidential election

through the first months of the year musk said he would refrain from backing any presidential candidate while at the same time holding private conversations discussing how he could get trump elected musk publicly endorsed him in july the businessman said he planned to commit as much as 45 million a month to a new super politicalaction committee in part to get it done according to people familiar with the matter the effort included hiring armies of canvassers to scour battleground states for voters

since then trump has said he intends to make musk the head of a government efficiency commission the two speak often

korea,differences between japan and korea as a solo traveller,"first of all this is not meant to be a hate rant or anything im just comparing the differences between the two from what i have experienced 

i have been to japan many times and my recent trip was 3 weeks and now im currently in korea been in korea many times with family but its my first time travelling solo and nearly finishing my 2 week trip 

convenience stores

honestly i preferred japanese convenience stores over korean experience stores there are way more proper meal options in japan for example theres a dessert fridge for puddings crepes and cakes which i used to always buy during my trip in japan but in korean convenience stores theres hardly any 

if you like ramen korean convenience stores can align more to your taste as there are more options 

that said korean convenience stores are really expensive water was like 23 usd for a large bottle while in japan its 1 usd a hotel staff told me not to buy stuff from convenience stores and go to local supermarkets instead as it was way too overpriced 

i used to use my ic card all in japan for food when im lazy but i hardly buy anything in korean convenience  stores due to the lack of options 
ic card talk will be explained in more detail in the next point 

that said if you like ramen korean convenience stores can align more to your taste as there are more options 

ic cards

japan ic cards are way more valuable than korean ic cards i have bought tickets for museums and other sites using ic cards compared to koreas t money card i could be wrong but i have yet to see its use elsewhere 

food delivery 

probably one of the biggest gripes i have in korea is the lack of delivery apps for foreigners

in japan you can use uber eats and i had 0 problems with it where as korea locks it to koreans only for no damn reason 

transport 

transport is fairly similar but id give it heads up to korea korea doesnt have private rail which can make it was less confusing compared to japanese rail 


when i first arrived in japan i took a while to figure how to use japans rail system since it was so overwhelming 

taxis are also way cheaper in korea than japan 
i remember forking out 70 dollars from dotonburi to my hotel in osaka 

tourist sites 

this can be controversial due to japan and koreas war time but i feel like korea lacks a lot of cultural sites 

i like to see a lot of cultural sites and museums and japan has a lot of that but korea doesnt have as much and most of the touristy stuff can be done in a span of a day 

i am korean so i know that a lot of the cultural sites were destroyed due to war etc but im just saying it as a tourist point of view 

hotels and facilities

korean hotels rooms tend to be larger than japanese hotels japanese hotels tend to have bathtub shower attachments in 1 to account for its small room size to be fair though i have grown quite fond of the japanese styles and dont mind it as much as before 

from the hotels i have been to japanese hotels has better facilities such as laundry rooms and vending machines i have yet to see a laundry room like japan in korea korea offers its own laundry service where washing a t shirt costs 10 usd 

from my experience as a solo traveller japan hotels are the way to go especially for the laundry rooms

hotels in seoul is way more expensive than tokyo by the difference for 100200 for a 3 star hotel 
make sure you bring a lot of money if you want to stay in korea imo 

etiquette

japan lives to bow and i kind of live that it makes me feel more welcome compared to korea thats not to say korea is rude as ive seen nice korean grandmas asking me to sit down and young people giving seats to the elderly

the bowing especially when in hotels trains etc really makes you feel welcome while in korea they just dont look or look away 

smell 

honestly it might sound rude but i am korean and i know the smell since i was a kid 

some korean places have bad sewage smell 
i have experienced this in gyeongju it could have been a one off thing but i do have that ptsd 

food 

now this can depend on personal preference 
when i first went to japan 4 years ago i didnt like the food because it was too salty and lacked the flavour compared to korean after my recent and current trip in korea i can say that koreas new generation of food is abit off putting with all the sugar for example i went to isaac toast because youtubers were ranting about it and after trying it today i can say that it is overrated it was overwhelmingly sweet with the sauce eggs and pickles 

that said traditional korean food is the way to go for the authentic taste 

also from my recent illness i can say that foreigners should stay away from raw seafood especially oysters and clams in korea i got norovirus from it and was throwing up and having diarrhoea for 2 days 

japan has a lot of cheap bentos such as a 1kg tonkatsu meal for 1213 usd 

japan also seem to have more options for food in restaurants for solo travellers compared to korea 


honestly i feel bored in korea right now but i might be because im just tired of travelling now and i miss my bed and my cat 

feel free to ask questions if i have left things out"

korea,whats a case where you believe the person is alive being kept hostageconfined ,"
personally i believe that david sneddon still remains in pyongyang north korea and is used as an english tutor under the alias of yoon bong soo this case has always interested me and its a shame its not received more attention there is a good podcast episode id recommend the two part series by unknown passage podcast and also the thin air podcast where they brought along davids father on air  


mr sneddon then a 24 year old student at brigham young university in utah disappeared in august 2004 while hiking in the tiger leaping gorge in chinas yunnan province fluent in korean and speaking some chinese he was sightseeing before heading home to utah and graduate school after finishing a twoyear mission for his church in south korea

the local chinese authorities first informed us officials and the sneddon family that david had most likely fallen into the river and drowned to death while hiking through the gorge however the familys own investigation soon afterward confirmed that david had finished his trek and been seen in a restaurant beyond the end of the gorge

his disappearance immediately thereafter was not explained although a number of factors indicated a north korean connection first north korean agents were actively operating in the area at the time with the acquiescence of chinese officials detaining north korean 
defectors and their suspected supporters second charles r jenkins a us soldier who deserted to north korea in 1965 and was used by the regime to teach english to north korean officials and agents left north korea one month before davids disappearance davids youth and fluency in english and korean would have made him particularly appealing as a replacement candidate third japanese specialists on north korea affiliated with the national association for the rescue of japanese kidnapped by north korea narkn obtained information from reliable sources in china that in august 2004 an american student closely matching davids description was detained by chinese authorities who were observed to release him into the hands of 
north korean agents

in september last year the us and uk media quoted mr choi to report that mr sneddon turned up alive in north korea after being kidnapped to serve as kim jong uns personal english tutor in august 2004 while he was traveling yunnan province china since then both the senate and the house of representatives of the us passed a resolution urging action to find out what happened to sneddon north korea strongly denied kidnapping him
it is said that the us embassy has been requested mr choi the current state of mr sneddon and further information to decisively confirm his identity up until now according to north korean sources sneddon has been relocated to mt myohyang and is under special surveillance after foreign press reports and was spotted at the chosun red cross hospital and pongsu church in pyongyan before being relocated
according to choi sources in north korea told him that then north korean leader kim jong il made a special order in 2004 to find a tutor to teach english and american culture to his children sources also said that the overseas political dissident division of the state security department and staffs deployed to myanmar kidnapped sneddon and brought him to pyongyang in october 2004
now mr sneddon goes by the korean name yoon bong soo and he is married to a woman named kim eun hae and they have two children a boy and a girl mr choi argued that such a story was revealed by a person who was involved in the kidnapping of mr sneddon and he confessed mr chois north korean source before he was dead

they have met with a multitude of ngos human rights advocates japanese government officials  who are convinced david is a victim of kidnapping by the hermit state

our latest information on davids case points to davids likely abduction by elements of the democratic peoples republic of korea north korea says a post from august last year we believe he is now being held captive there

the sneddons are bruised by the lack of interest from the us department of state which maintains there is not credible evidence david was abducted they presume their story doesnt fit the narrative the department wants for uschina relations

the credible evidence david was drowned in the gorge was the chinese said thats what happened says roy

theyve never really investigated a lot of material adds kathleen they may have been investigating it privately thats my hope that theyre silently working on it

her husband is less patient if youre suddenly thrown off a ship and pray a dolphin will come and give you a ride youre probably best off to start swimming yourself says roy

we decided wed try swimming ourselves theres so much politics its difficult

kathleen trusts her son is probably safe for now but her eyes are wide open to the dangers and she sees clear reasons why their son might not have been able to contact them for all these years

if kim jongun didnt like david anymore hed be killed she says the internet is absolutely closed in north korea some people may have access to a phone from china but he probably doesnt want to jeopardise himself and his wife and children

if any one of our children had to be abducted and cope with a difficult situation its david he has great personal belief on the inside hes very strong

i just want to run up to him hug him and get to know his wife and children

despite their desperation to see their son again the sneddons have also found room in their hearts to feel deeply for the north korean people its such an evil and repressive empire says kathleen i hope david is freed and something happens and these people will be freed

as they watch the pressure on north korea increase over its repressive regime and nuclear testing they wonder if their adjustable son could even play a vital role in a transition

id like to think in the long run david could be a blessing to the people of north korea says kathleen i hope david can move mountains she laughs were both dreamers

roy interjects i dont think we are i believe kim jonguns regime will fall it wont happen because the us sends an aircraft carrier itll be because people watching in positions of power say enough is enough

edit i forgot i could use my australian passport to travel to china with less hassle lol i just wanted to use my us passport coming home to get through us customs

i want to see more than pyongyang and beyond typical tourist routes i read earlier on this sub that some tour companies with china do take you to provinces outside of the capital and i am fluent in chinese i have some korean as well

lastly my partner is korean american ethnically south korean and fluent in korean and has a sole us citizenship his background and language skill is irrelevant here other than being able to help us get around in korea the only thing at play here is that he is a naturalized us citizen moved to the us from south korea at three years old so without obtaining permission due to national interest would he be able to travel with me

another edit i didnt think ethnicity mattered and i only mentioned my partner was south korean because hes from there if it does i am ethnically chinese born in australia i have a chinese last name also can anyone who has been there clarify whether you are allowed to befriend or interact with locals

edit again seeing as i have clarified that i am chinese american you can safely assume i have family and friends back in china i can entrust my us passport to a close family member in china before i depart to nk seeing as i have to stop back there in china in order to go back home to the us anyway they wont find my passport on my body or belongings when i travel to nk"

korea,traveling in korea never have i ever been more tempted by emergency equipment,every hotel and train station has them and i want to test then
korea,the us is quite possibly the least racist country in the world,"im sick of hearing people talk down on the us saying that you guys are racist and problematic and what have you claiming that the us is racist or white supremacist or any of that is just telling of a deep ignorance about the rest of the world
  

  
go to south korea and befriend a 40 something person then ask them what they think of black people theyre not going to say african american or black person theyll say the word followed by a bunch of statements that would make racist redneck uncle fester blush because in their society being racist carries no consequence
  

  
go to eastern europe down a few palinkas with the locals and ask them what they think of the traveling folk you may just find yourself wondering how long itll be before they reopen the camps
  

  
or go to china and ask a han chinese if they think theres peoplescultures that are better than others youll be left wondering if youre talking to a chinese person in 2023 or a german in 1933 with the amount of ethnosupremacy theyll spout and nobody will blink an eye at that because their schools teach them that the han are supreme to everyone else
  

  
theres only 2 reasons people think the us is racist the first is ignorance of the state of the rest of the world and a lack of understanding that racism is the basic setting in the majority of the world and the second reason is ironically because you folks are actually trying to tackle issues of racism and ethnosupremacy in strange ways sometimes but in my book youre still getting an a for effort
  

  
theres maybe a dozen or so countries in the world where being racist or ethnosupremacist actually carries consequences and the us is right up there with them in south korea you can shitpost on twitter till the cows come home and nothing will happen in the us you can accidentally say something racist and lose your job tomorrow dont let anyone ever tell you that yall are racist"
korea,list of the shit weve been through so far in 2020,"i made a list of the major events from wikipedias page on 2020 back in june so i thought id do it again almost no one saw it last time but i had fun mostly bc of morbid curiosity

ill probably do this again once 2020 is over see all 5 of you reading this then 

edit i dont want to make a cringy edit but thanks so much guys i plan to make a more comprehensive list that doesnt just use wikipedia and isnt so eurocentric

edit if theres something i can add lemme know"

korea,strange letter left on girlfriends car in little italy,NO BODY
korea,iama guy who went to north korea this august i was told that there would be interest in knowing about my experience also i have traveled to 2030 countries and might be able to help you with travel tips ama,"like i said i went to north korea i personally found that a lot of things like the vice pieces on the country did not match my experiences  other adventures of note include climbing mount kilimanjaro japanmount fuji many tours across the us bolivia peru a massive trip across europe and currently i am getting ready to go to iran and hike across iceland so i could provide info on how i am getting ready for that if there is interest  

my proof here is a picture of the mass games in pyongyang a painting a smuggled out and my proofhttpimgurcoma6c8a2 if the mods need a picture of my face both in and out of north korea i can message that to them but otherwise i would like to retain my anonymity  

so without further ado what are some things you guys would like to know

edit here is a trick you guys can know if you go to north korea  everyone talks about the 5th floor like it is something special hidden and secret  well it is not the only secret floor on the hotel  there are several throughout the yanggakdo hotel in pyongyang  i was not able to figure out all of the codes i was a little scared after being accused of being a spy and running into a soldier but if you are in the hotel push both of the elevator buttons and wait  the first elevator is a decoy dont take it  then another elevator will open up and there are all the missing floors at least when i was there they change it if you press the button nothing happens so there is a key combination for that as well but i did not have time to crack it but if you go to north korea you might be able to use that to get in places that are off limits do with that knowledge what you will


edit 2 ok it has been 3 hours plus i need to study a little bit  if you have asked questions or want to ask new ones i will get to them and answer you  op will deliver

edit 3 i found better proof my boarding pass from pyongyang to beijing on air koryo and my dprk visa i had printed off here you gohttpimgurcomab9wnr

korea,air bnb warns of slowing us demand as shares fall 14cnbc,i feel bad for the hosts who you can tell genuinely do it for a side income and take pride in hosting people i had some great experiences pre covid now in the us the cost of most air bnbs are the same as hotels i havent stayed in a domestic air bnb in about 2 years international travel it is still a pretty good option i was in korea and japan for three weeks last summer and my accomidations were fantastic and only 1200 usd also the airbnb subreddit is wild hosts will literally blame everything on guests when i tried to make this post there it was deleted  
korea,am i an offensive person or is the next generation too sensitive,"i 36m was sitting in a cafe today with a friend 32m  who said he was travelling to japan soon i was excited for him because ive been to japan twice and i started talking about my experiences 

i said something like
 japan is such a quirky country lots of unique places places so rich with culture spoke about some examples of places to goeatcheck out

careful of some bars you dont really know what youre walking into i stumbled some bars that had questionable ethics with woman wasnt my thing also dont get confused with love hotels turns out theyre not a cheap hostel accomodation 

but hey get the japan rail pass you can cruise around the country real fast im excited for you 

after 30 minutes a young guy maybe 20m came up to us and said hey i just want you to know that you offended my korean girlfriend when you were talking about travelling before some people think they are trying to be cool with travel stories

i kinda looked blankly at him paused and said didnt mean to offend him or his girlfriend and he walked off

got me thinking
1 why are you eaves dropping on random peoples conversation
2 your girlfriend is korean and im talking about japan 
3 am i an asshole my goal is never to outwardly offend people rather just talk about some experiences i had japan is 100 a culturally different place to us white people


edit 1 woooaahhh this is my first reddit post but what a response thanks everyone for their views

1 the total conversation was about for 12 minutes i think i mentioned something about a fondle bar which could of been the trigger i apologise if i misled you down the wrong path 

2 i learnt today about the dark history between japan and korea had i more insight of this at the at the time i would of handled this differently 

3 i would of really appreciated clarity on why i was offensive and this is something i didnt handle very well it was my first confrontation with a stranger over anything ive said in my life was part shame part bewilderment next time i will be respectively curious over someones feelings rather than just spurt out an apology for no real understanding of the situation 

edit 2
i shouldnt of generalised a generation these are just two idiots who cant seem to have a coffee at a cafe without being offended 

seems an overwhelming majority share my gut feeling

1 fuck you for listening on my conversation
2 if you find yourself offended by a conversation you had nothing to do with go get a helmet and toughen up the world exists and if im describing it in my own words who cares if you dont like it 
3 public spaces are just that public spaces no need to confuse it with the alternate reality you create around making people abide by the rules you make in your head

robert lewandowski was supposed to do his bachelors and masters degrees in secret from the world at a university in d linked to a scientist suspected of trading in diplomas now new information is coming to light  i have not seen him in front of my eyes during my exams yet from the documents i was shown during the interrogation it appears that he passed my subject twice  barbara mrozinska a sociologist from d who was previously linked to the university where the captain of the polish national team was supposed to get his diploma tells onet

robert lewandowski captain of the polish national football team and striker of the famous barcelona had his higher education for 13 years this is according to official information that he himself has made public it is known that he started his studies as a 19yearold in 2007 and only after ten years in 2017 he obtained his bachelors degree in turn he defended his masters thesis in 2020 which was quickly reported by the national media he obtained both of these diplomas in warsaw at the college of education in sport this education is not disputed by anyone

however two other diplomas were issued in the name of the famous footballer a bachelors and a masters degree he was to obtain them at a private university in d in great secrecy from the world he would defend his masters degree during a video conference during adam nawakas 2018 national team training camp in addition both diplomas would be awarded while he was laboriously studying at the aforementioned university in warsaw where let us remind you it took him as long as 13 years to study

could it be that the famous polish footballer had so much time to pull two courses of study at two different universities in d and warsaw in between his numerous matches training sessions business activities and private life

our source in law enforcement familiar with the backstory of the diploma affair in which lewandowskis name appears indicates that after lewy got his diplomas in d without studying the footballer chickened out and never made them public

 the driving force behind robert getting his diplomas in d quickly and painlessly was supposed to be his wife ania she wanted her husband after he started his studies in warsaw in 2007 and was unable to finish them for years to nevertheless have a higher education and be able to go to a coaching school for example in the future the opportunity to get the diplomas became an acquaintance with zbigniew d a scholar from d and also a football activist who was known in the sports community for being able to arrange among other things certificates from the university of which he was the chancellor our informant points out

 robert received both diplomas from d through connections but at some point realised that lies have short legs and precautionarily never showed these papers off after all it would look strange if it turned out that he had been studying in warsaw for 13 years with all his sweat and all of a sudden he got two diplomas in d the upshot was that he legally completed the studies he had long ago started in warsaw and the diplomas from d were to remain a big secret to a small group of people argues an onet source in law enforcement agencies

 the former chancellor and the secrets of his phone

the mystery of lewandowskis d degrees has finally come to light by accident as we wrote in onet in 2019 the police arrested zbigniew d a scientist from d in the act in the past which is not insignificant in this story he was a football activist of ks d he met many famous athletes in fact one of his sons played football competitively later he and his wife did their habilitation in slovakia which still raises questions in the scientific community in d

five years ago zbigniew d fell for trying to sell a diploma from the university of which he was the chancellor  this was the now defunct university of health education and social sciences wsezins in d he fell during a police provocation  he wanted to sell the diploma to a woman who was honest and had previously reported the matter to the police officers detained the scientist secured his phone at the time and discovered surprising information in it

it turned out that several years ago zbigniew d had been in a lively correspondence with anna lewandowska and with other athletes and their representatives he had talked to them about supplementing their education

among other things a copy of a masters degree in pedagogy issued to robert lewandowski with the signature of the rector of the d university  zbigniew ds wife  was found at the scientist from d in 2019

also found were documents issued in the name of jacek gralski former polish national team player a copy of his identity card a secondary school certificate and a bachelors degree in adventist theology supposedly issued by a private university from near warsaw this bachelors degree would be defended by gralski with an 55 in october 2017 on the day of adam nawakas national teams qualifying match against montenegro poland won 42 with gralski watching the entire match from the substitutes bench

a copy of the matura diplom for arkadiusz milik translated into italian and english was also found

gralski and milik later denied that they had received any diplomas through zbigniew d

the d university wsezins at which lewandowski was supposed to have obtained his bachelors degree and of which zbigniew d was chancellor no longer exists the university of social sciences uns has been operating at the same address in d for years  zbigniew d became a lecturer there his wife was the rector and his son first became the chancellor and now serves as rector it was at uns which was started to be managed by the closest family of the suspected exchancellor that lewy would continue his education in d and complete his masters degree and it was this university that after our 2021 texts sued onet and the author of this text

the d university of social sciences is demanding an apology from us a donation of pln 30000 to a social cause and argues that robert lewandowski is its graduate and that he obtained his diplomas in lodz in a legal manner

are we sure

 lewandowski was supposed to pass two exams with me i have not seen him with my eyes

unexpectedly a few days ago dr barbara mroziska spoke out on this issue she is a sociologist from d and the head of a private television station as it turns out she has recently been questioned by investigators from gdask who have been explaining the diploma affair involving zbigniew d since 2019 and in which the names of leading polish footballers are mentioned

robert lewandowski bought his diploma at a private university in d i write this with full responsibility because he passed two exams with me i found out about everything during my interrogation as a witness in this disgusting case  dr barbara mroziska wrote on the x platform

we called her as she pointed out the matter is public and she spoke up on platform x out of a sense of decency on the grounds that many of her students had to work hard to get a degree first to come at weekends to take parttime classes and then to pass the notsoeasy exams with her

dr mroziska taught social research methodology at the now defunct college of health education and social sciences of which zbigniew d was chancellor

with her entry and statements for onet the sociologist refutes the version of the d university that the captain of the national football team legally obtained two diplomas at the university

barbara mroziska told us that she had never seen lewandowski either in classes or in exams and she would have to have seen if he was in fact her student meanwhile at an interview last month she found out that she was supposed to have examined the famous footballer and twice during his undergraduate and graduate studies

every time the lewy was supposed to get threes with her maybe because she had a lot of demands on her students in the online documents next to the grades in her subjects her signature was not present it is not known who entered these grades into the electronic system behind her back instead dr mroziska kept paper attendance records for her classes she never recorded the attendance of student robert lewandowski

according to the electronic entries that dr mroziska saw at other lecturers in d the striker had better grades including fours plus and fives

 if he had taken an exam with me he would have had to come to me meanwhile his grade card showed that he passed two subjects with me which was definitely not the case i would remember such a wellknown student emphasises barbara mroziska

 lewys former manager version about d diplomas sounds ridiculous

in an interview with onet the sociologist did not want to prejudge whether lewy had arranged or bought a diploma for himself or whether someone from the d university as a gift had decided to give him first his bachelors degree and then his masters degree she does not want to expose himself to a lawsuit she points out however that the latter version that the diplomas were arranged behind the footballers back or that someone forced them on him is highly unlikely

she also admitted that she once heard from students at a d university that lewandowski had come to collect a diploma at the time she took it as a joke

lewandowskis dz diplomas are also not believed by his former manager and now opponent in various criminal and civil cases it is referring to cezary kucharski who has been on the warpath with the footballer for several years

 for me it is unbelievable that in the time i was his manager he would do some diplomas in lodz he had no time for his family and sponsors during his visits to poland so how would he find time for some secret teaching in d it sounds ridiculous when we were still working together i knew his every step in poland we would set his calendar when he was in the country all i knew was that he was completing his education in warsaw that official ba he wrote about himself  rl9 the road to fame was printed and bound by an employee of our office robert did not do anything in poland without our knowledge so he certainly did not travel to d for lectures and exams cezary kucharski tells onet

 difficult questions for the lewandowski family

when we were collecting material for the first text on the graduation affair in 2021 we called anna lewandowska she was the one who according to onets findings had corresponded with the suspected scientist zbigniew d and had met him at the national stadium on the occasion of a national team match discussed collecting a briefcase with contents not mentioned in the correspondence lewandowska immediately referred us to her manager who referred us to monika bondarowicz who was then in charge of the lewandowski familys pr when asked about lewys education in 2021 bondarowicz answered evasively

the diploma affair which we revealed went quiet for a while only the prosecutors office tried hard to establish who onets source was it questioned many people including the author of the article in turn lawyers for zbigniew d and his family began preparing a lawsuit against our editorial office

the topic returned in february 2024 at that time the central anticorruption bureau detained zbigniew d a scientist from d the same one who allegedly arranged the diploma for lewy zbigniew d was arrested in february in the notorious collegium humanum affair involving the issuing of fake mba diplomas according to investigators he was supposed to be an intermediary in this corrupt procedure the mastermind of which was supposed to be the rector of the university pawe c

when we described zbigniew ds new troubles in february in onet and reminded readers that he had previously arranged suspicious diplomas for leading polish footballers representatives of robert lewandowski spoke out in the media

dealing with the national team captains pr artur adamowicz announced that the footballer had those diplomas that were officially known  that is those from warsaw lewandowski was only supposed to learn about the appearance of his name in the context of the d university as his spokesman assured him from an onet publication in 2021

 has lewy bought a degree footballer again avoids the answer

this time we turned to lewandowskis representatives after dr barbara mroziskas post among other things we asked the following questions

 did lewandowski really buy a diploma at a d university as the sociologist publicly indicated
 why was lewy visiting a d university linked to a suspicious scientist the proof is in his photo which we have seen
 how does the footballer explain the fact that he has marks from exams he did not appear for
 why was the athletes wife in correspondence with the suspected academic zbigniew d and several years ago arranged to meet him and collect his portfolio
 does robert lewandowski have diplomas from d and if so why has he never boasted about them

the lewys pr officer artur adamowicz replied to us that following our questions lewandowskis representatives confirmed that he has witness status in the case and wants to answer the prosecutions questions first although the date of the hearing is not yet known he also provided a brief comment from kamil gorzelnik lewandowskis lawyer

in response to the questions raised i would like to inform you that in the case concerning the university of social sciences in d robert lewandowski has the status of a witness and will answer all questions from the relevant authorities at an agreed date robert lewandowski has nothing to hide in this case and is keen to have it fully cleared up as part of the ongoing proceedings  this is the official position of the footballers lawyer

this position is surprising as lewandowski can hardly be said to be a witness in the case onets information shows that he has not been summoned for questioning to date

so why are lewandowskis representatives claiming that he is a witness and that he would be waiting for a date to be set for the hearing is this another ploy to avoid answering our questions lewandowskis representatives have chosen to remain silent  they have not explained on what basis they claim and how they have confirmed that the footballer has witness status in the ongoing investigation

a spokeswoman for the gdask prosecutors office grayna wawryniuk in turn told onet that lewandowski has not been questioned so far and will he be eg as a witness the spokeswoman for the public prosecutors office replied that she was not aware of the footballer being summoned for questioning moreover the public prosecutors office due to the good of the investigation is not in the habit of announcing in advance whether it will question someone or not

 university from d lewy studied with us but didnt want to brag about it

for the time being the university of social sciences in d has presented its position on lewandowskis diplomas it had already taken onet and the author of this text to court many months ago the university associated with the scientist suspected of diploma trafficking argues that lewy first did his bachelors degree at the wsezins university in d where zbigniew d was chancellor then on 24 march 2018 he defended his masters thesis at the university of social sciences whose rector was the scientists wife

he was due to defend his masters thesis during the national teams training camp before the world cup in russia one day after losing a friendly match against nigeria and three days before winning a match against south korea the footballer according to the university defended himself via video conference and afterwards asked not to make publicity that he had just become a master teacher

moreover the university points out that lewandowskis d diploma has been recorded in the polon database which is among other things a record of certificates obtained by polish students in addition the footballers diploma has its own number and in his personal file are lewys bachelors and masters theses checked by the way in an antiplagiarism programme

as witnesses to confirm this version the d university wants to call the suspected scientist zbigniew d his wife urszula who is also facing charges and anna and robert lewandowski as well as their close friend the doctor emil jdrzejewski the medic as he himself had previously argued in an interview with onet was said to have supplied the d university with documents relating to lewandowskis education and assured us that lewy had certainly studied there

at the same time the university wants the trial against our editorial to take place behind closed doors without the participation of other media in secrecy from the public it explains this by its concern for the secrets of the company  the university  and by the fact that coverage of the trial could jeopardise unss personal assets

the university would also like to present a copy of lewandowskis diploma to corroborate its claims that it had such a famous student within its walls one that he has never boasted about about which he does not want to say a word and for which he has taken exams that he has not been seen in

only that the personal file of graduate robert lewandowski as the university emphasises in the lawsuit was taken away many months ago by the prosecutors office in gdask investigators do not want to hand them over because they take the view that the documents may constitute evidence to detect and prove a crime

 two investigations involving a suspected scientist from d  

both investigations in which scientist and former football activist zbigniew d is facing charges are ongoing the proceedings at the regional prosecutors office in gdask in which the names of wellknown athletes appear are now in their fifth year according to our information the footballers have not been questioned

the prosecutors office had previously taken the position that even if the wellknown athletes had received fake diplomas if they hid them in a drawer they had not committed any crime they would only be breaking the law if they used a fake document somewhere  for example to get into a coaching school

does the prosecutors office now have a different view she replied that she would not give us detailed information on what she intends to do in the ongoing proceedings

it is known that in the gdask investigation zbigniew w has so far been charged with 46 offences related to the forgery of documents more than a dozen other people have also been charged including his wife urszula recently the former rector of the university of social sciences where lewandowski would have obtained his masters degree is suspected of committing four offences they relate to the article of the penal code stipulating the attestation of untruths in documents in order to gain a financial or personal benefit

the proceedings of the public prosecutors office in gdask have been extended until 29 august and as her spokeswoman points out they will not end on that date interrogations are ongoing and further evidence is being collected

in contrast in the investigation in katowice into the huge scandal at the collegium humanum zbigniew d faces several charges he was recently released from custody the case as the investigators emphasise is a developing one there are already dozens of suspects in it in june the collegium humanum affair saw the detention of further academics  the rectors of several private universities  as well as people associated with the polish accreditation committee including its former head members of the commission which is supposed to ensure the highest standards in the academic world were paid bribes to turn a blind eye to various irregularities at universities

at one time the polish accreditation commission also controlled the university of social sciences in its lawsuit against onet the d university boasts that these inspections were very successful for it

korea,traveling to korea as a hijabi,"hello

im going to south korea very soon as a muslim female who wears the hijab ive been wanting to visit korea for years and im super excited to be traveling and enjoying my time in korea  

however im a bit nervous and scared for hate and islamophobia its my first time visiting an asian country and im not so familiar with the people and their education on religions etc i was wondering what kind of view korean people has on muslim people and if it would be possible for me to experience racism i understand some people might now be familiar with it and starring might occur but im just very nervous and would like to be prepared before going heh"
korea, question for kpop fans about traveling to korea,"hi im noh a korean intern at the gwangju tourism organization



as a kpop fan has your love for kpop made you interested in visiting korea or have you already been here before



wed love to hear anything you have to share at the gwangju tourism organization were always looking to develop kpoprelated tourism content but as you might already know about 80 of tourists visit seoul 10 go to busan and 8 to jeju the rest of the country is left competing for the remaining 2 of foreign visitors



with places like hongdae itaewon kpop attractions and even tours of big agencies like sm and jyp in seoul i totally understand why everyone would just stay there



i live in gwangju and id love for more international tourists to come and enjoy my city what kind of content or attractions would appeal the most to international visitors



to be honest gwangju does have a kpop star street where you can find handprint sculptures photo zones memorabilia displays and a statue that btss jhope visited called the hope statue but i know that alone might not be enough to convince people to visit gwangju during their limited time in korea



as kpop fans what kind of content or experiences would make you say id definitely go to gwangju for that



your opinions would be incredibly valuable to us and we appreciate each and every one of them



have a great day"

korea,basic question on bus travel in korea ,do we have to press the stop button always to let the driver know our stop has arrived also do we have to tap the card both during entry as well as exit i see a few people tap it on exit while some others dont
korea,number of foreign travelers to korea,NO BODY
korea,i travel to north korea annually ama,"i am an american citizen who travels to north korea each year i have done so since 2008 and have a total of 38 days in the country i have been requested to do this by several users so i will give it a try 

1 why do you travel to north korea 
there are a number of reasons for me the first is that i have traveled all over the socialist bloc in the old days and north korea is the last one standing i was raised as an army brat and saw the cold war from the other side i have a degree in east asian politics and this was only natural to want to go after traveling china in the old days i also have a disdain for experts of any kind that have never set foot in the society they are studying this was very common during the cold war and with north korea

2 how can you go if you are an american 
easy just get on a tour there is a preconception that americans cannot go that is just not true on my first trip people online accused me of stealing photos now i routinely find my photos stolen by others 

3 what do you see as a tourist 
that depends on your first visit you will see very little relative to what you expect to see you will see some interesting things but unless you know what to look for you will not see that much you will be well fed and meet lots of nice people if you have not been to a totalitarian state what would you know to look for if you go back or stay long enough you will begin to see behind the society and get a better picture of things 

4 what are you allowed to photograph 
one of the reasons i go is to document the society i have taken 20000 photos the photo restrictions are the toughest i have encountered i used to tour eastern europe on my own as well as the ussr but this is something different in cuba they do not care what you shoot here you will have minders and it can be difficult i want to take photos of the korean people and their lives that is not always possible they will not shoot you but they will threaten or get others in the group to talk to you 

5 why do you go back
again i want to see this society and the longer i can stay the more i see this year we got to see things not seen before an air raid the speaker more construction  the poorest areas of the country and more things tourists do not get to see remember this they cannot hide everything and the longer you stay the more you will see "

busan,a guide to busan from self proclaimed busan lover,"got back from busan trip cant wait to go back again with busan about to get a load of visitors i feel like this is the right time to write this guide i will cover how to get to busan how to get around in busan what places to visit and general tips

1 how to get to busan
   1 by train srt and ktx makes frequent trips to busan busan has two high speed train stations busan station and gupo station depending on where you want to visit go to stations that is close to your destination station
   2 by air there are load of planes flying gimpogimhaebusan takes about an hour this is faster then trains however both gimpo and gimhae are not located near downtown areas and considering transport time to airport ultimately there are very little time difference between trains gimhae is connected to downtown busan by bus and railway
   3 by bus busan has 7 expressintercity bus terminals check the location of your destination terminal some of these stations are located in outskirts of busan and may leave you with longer travel time to your destination
2 how to get around in busan
   1 by trainnot subway busan has 9 train stations you could ride itx or mugunghwa stopping at these station this is the fastest way to get around long distance within busan however this needs extensive planning to pull it off check train schedule and hope you get lucky

7 stations of busan red hwamyeong bright yellow gupo green sasang purple busan station blue bujeon black centum orange sinhaeundae gray gijanghttpspreviewredditfp8dmdh41ot91jpgwidth1057formatpjpgautowebps85837be3ee0453c90cf44b9bc38e0296c65e3e72

2 by subway there are 6 subway lines running through busan currently

httpspreviewredditskncn6761ot91jpgwidth1380formatpjpgautowebps9456bb7bc3b246f06f91c752390ef0efea223002

subways start running in 56am to midnight usually fewer stationsshorter traveling time so if you dont have kakaomap to caculate best routes for you use route with less stations

busan subway accepts tmoney and cashbee you can use the same transit card that you used on the other city

or you could get single use subway tickets busan subway is the only subway left in korea that still uses paper magnetic ticketsthose that are used on japans subway  as of 2024 this is no longer the case

another difference is that busans subway offer unlimited daypass and unlimited multiday pass these are only worth it if you plan on getting on and off subways a lot

important note if youre planning to use donghaenambu linelight blue read this transit between other lines and donghaenambu are weird transportation cardstmoney cashbee should be fine but this might come with additional fee if youre on single use subway tickets or day passes you cant use them

3 by bus busan also has extensive bus system one thing to keep in mind though busan is generally agreed among koreans as the hardest city to drive in korea but most bus drivers have years of experince behind the wheel however they cant do anything about traffic jams

4 by taxi when there are no public transportation available taxi is the only optionnote no ubers in korea uber app still works but it connects you to taxi drivers if it says   in the front window it means that taxi is looking for customers wave at the taxi to call them driver may turn on their hazard lights to signal that they saw you or just stop in front of you if you cannot find taxis call one download kakao t it will grab you nearest available taxi to your location

koreas taxi has meter counter on them and these cannot be tempered with so fraudulent fees are really really really rare

if you are really late for something say palipali to driver this kicks taxi drivers into overdrive only use it in emergencies

httpswwwvisitbusannetenindexdohttpswwwvisitbusannetenindexdo

if you know detailed guide on where to visit in busan check website above i wish i could list everything that takes too long

did you know busan is also famous for their hot springs

did you know busan being the ocean city all types of water based sports are available windserfing jetskying beaches and much morei dont know much about these forgive my lack of examples but as i am writing this guide its fall i dont think people are so keen to get into the ocean right now but there are still yacht tours which i really enjoyed

did you know there are lots of traces of north korea and korean war busan this is because during korean war lots of population fled to busan some of them opened restraunts which are passed down to today so north korean food in busan another example is international market people started selling smuggled us army goods during the war in this market so you could get oversea goodswhich was rare in korea korea was ranked one of the poorest country in the world back then hence the name of international market

did you know there is a town made out of gravestones in busan amidong culture village has multiple houses with their foundation using gravestones this is because this place used to be a cemetery during japanese occupation during korean war people built house on top of it because there were no place to build houses gamcheon culture village is nearby so you could look around amidong while visiting there

enough fluff ill stop beating around the bush

1 orignal downtown
2 west busan
3 seomyeon
4 donglae
5 east busan

1 original downtown junggu yeongdogu donggu seogu the classicthese parts are orignally considered as main busan dispite most of its downtown function moving away to other areas original downtown to rich with busans history

main areas are nampodong international market biffbusan flim festival 168 steps busan tower songdo beach huinnyeoul culture village

2 west busan gangseogu dongnaegu yeonjegu the underdogwest busan is more populated by factories houses and apartements which makes it having less touriest attractions but still has few hidden gems

main areas are gamcheon culture village seokbulsa temple various wetland that attracts lots of people birdwatching

3 seomyeon little gangnamseomyeon is my homebase when i go to busan it has lots of stuff to dodepartment stores cafe markets etc it has excellent transportationbujeon station and busan station is nearby when it comes to trains bus routes cover seomyeons major roads seomyeon subway station is a major transit station where line 1 and 2 meet this is where also lotte hotel is located one of the top tier hotels in korea

4 donglae geumjeonggu dongnaegu yeonjegu the history nerdsorry not much to say about this area never visited however busan started from donglae so this is the oldest busan out of the five

main areas are beomeosathis temple is really old sajik baseball stadium dongnae hot spring

5 east busannew and famouseverything you heard about busan is probably from here however let me just say while haeundae is great for visiting but not so great when it comes to hotels not because their hotels are bad but getting somewhere else from haeundae to other areas outside busan takes a long time

main areas blueline park dongbak island marinecity bexco thebay101 lct gwanganli beachdrone shows on saturdays lotteworld busan and so so much more

general tips

1 while korea is safe use common sense dont go late at night alone if you do stick to major roads where there are lots of people
2 korea doesnt have tipping culture dont tip you could if you receive excellent service theyll be surprised
3 cashless is everywhere in korea
4 download kakaomapgetting around papagotranslation kakao ttaxi these help you a lot

busan,best and fastest way to travel from incheon to busan,"hello

i will be visiting south korea in last week of april with my wife and my son i have planned for seoul and busan and planning to do busan first for 3 days and then seoul

i will be having two large 23kg trolley bags one 15kg trolley couple of bagpacks and a stroller for my son

what are my best and faster option to get to busan from incheon i will be landing at 745 am in incheon

i have few options in mind kind weigh in on those and feel free to suggest other options too

1 travel to gimpo airport from incheon and take domestic flight to busan this seems fastest way but theres no direct flight from incheon to gimhae downside is i will have to pay extra for luggage since the airline is air busan
2 second option is to get to seoul station from incheon via bus so i can keep luggage easily and get ktx to busan from there im not sure how i can carry this luggage in seoul ktx station all the way to the train
3 get bus from incheon and spend 6 hoursim not comfortable with this
4 if theres other option please suggest

busan,"traveling from busan to fukuoka by camellia line ferry 

","i recently traveled from busan to fukuoka by ferry and i wanted to share my experience for anyone considering the same route 

booking the tickets  
finding tickets that werent part of tour packages on korean sites was a challenge buying directly from the camellia line ferry wasnt an option either as all the secondclass the cheapest shared rooms tickets were sold out eventually i purchased my tickets from 12goasiahttps12goasiaen but it took days for them to confirm which was incredibly stressful i kept messaging and emailing them until they finally confirmed

arriving at busan port

at busan stations you can follow the signs to the port if you arrive early and want to explore busan without your luggage theres a place to store it at the port just be aware that it closes around 12 pm for about an hour for a lunch break  
the ticket advised arriving 3 hours before departure but we arrived about 15 hours before boarding checkin was pretty fast almost like an airport one important thing to remember bring your passport and if you have an arc good to have that too after checking in theres a small coffee shop and a dutyfree shop but dont expect wellknown brandsit seemed like mostly inhouse brands

boarding the ferry

when boarding started people rushed to get to their roomsprobably to secure spots in the lounge areas i was in second class which means sleeping on the floor in a japanesestyle setup there was one outlet in my room and the tv outlets it uses outlets for japan so i suggest buying an adapterconverter at daiso i am from canada so my chargers and hair straighter worked fine the pillows they provide are brickshaped and quite hard so if you need a proper pillow i highly suggest bringing your own if you are in second class the room i was in had about 10 people and while the rooms are generally gendersegregated i did see some rooms accommodating couples or families

the ferry has a cafeteria some vending machines and an openstyle bathroom with a small bath many passengers brought their own food like pizza and chicken and ate in the cafeteria the showers and the small convenience store onboard close once the ferry starts moving around 11 pm and the cafeteria might close too also note that only japanese yen is accepted on the ferry and during my trip the card machines werent working due to bad weather definitely bring cash another thing to note there is no wifi on board so i had my shows downloaded

the ride to fukuoka was honestly the worst ferry ride ive ever been on the boat was rocking so much that it was difficult to walk and i felt dizzy most of the timei held onto the wall for support my stomach felt like it was on a roller coaster on the way back though it was a completely different story the ride was so smooth i couldnt even feel the boat moving i strongly suggest bringing motion sickness medicine just in case both trips my friend slept through the whole entry thing and said it was super comfortable

in the morning the showers open for a limited time so if you want to use them its a good idea to line up early you can also buy korean or japanese style breakfast also the ferry doesnt provide free toothbrushes or other toiletries so make sure to bring your own

one of the highlights of the trip was making a new friend on the ferry we shared some chicken and chatted before heading to our rooms to sleep the ferry also has a small arcade and karaoke rooms which added to the fun

immigration at fukuoka was surprisingly fast because i lined up with my luggage to get off the ferry first i put my luggage on the second floor in front of the exit door which many other passengers did as well however returning to korea took much longer as korean immigration seemed to be more thorough

once you arrive in fukuoka you can buy a bus card at the port and even an esim from a vending machine if youre an iphone user you can also buy a bus card through an app for those with phones that support esim i recommend purchasing one from an app like airalo theres a bus right at the port that takes you straight to hakata station for around 250 yen

i hope my experience was able to help anyone who was thinking of taking a ferry from busan to japan

edit  i wanted to add that i added camilla line ferry one line just to confirm if i was indeed a passenger because i was so nervous 12goasia was a scam which they did confirm and everything worked out the great part of adding them on line was that they were giving me updates on things with the ferry that 12goasia did not do"
busan,solo traveler on the haeundae sky capsule in busan,hey everyone this is a really dumb question but im going to busan for the first time in january only time i have a break from school and i want to ride the haeundae sky capsule but on the website the tickets start at two people and go up i moved to korea from another country so obviously im alone lol is it weird if i just buy the two person tickets and then ride it alone does anyone have experience with buying a single rider ticket online somehow im still only intermediate in korean so id rather buy tickets online in advance than in person to ensure i wont have any awkward    moments because i have anxiety  thanks

busan,travelling to busan on aug 15 as japanese tourists,"hi
my friends and i are travelling to busan this august from the 1418 and it slipped my mind that aug 15th is liberation day for some context im half japanese  half korean one friend is half japanese  half indonesien and the other friend is fully japanese but we all fluently speak english 
i heard that people hold parades and ceremonies to celebrate the liberation on this day and we do not want to seem like ignorant japanese tourists are there any places that we should steer clear of also are businesses usually closed on this day 

although we speak english we usually unconsciously mix in japanese so i think people will catch on that we are japanese once again we want to respect the day as much as possible and do not want to come across as ignorant japanese tourists your advice and answers would be deeply appreciated thank you"

httpspreviewredditgu9wuydftbda1jpgwidth1024formatpjpgautowebpsc3b202073b2120f35eb4ede60deeb056028453c5

 lets discuss the train option first

x200b

1 the train will take you from the 1st stop mipo to the last stop songjeong beach its easy to get tickets and you usually wont have to wait very long

 1 way  literally 1 way but if you ever exit at any stop to see one of the sights along the way youll need to pay again
 2 way  both ways but once again you are not able to get on and off freely at the various stations
 free use  as it implies you can get on and off all the stops however if you get on at a certain station you can not get on a 2nd time at the same station i guess they do this to prevent people from sharing their tickets

httpspreviewredditqckcyn3etbda1jpgwidth580formatpjpgautowebps7d1f51c9334355f150626e751c715623ff85667f

2 the sky capsule will take you from the 1st stop mipo to the 3rd stop cheongsapo which is roughly halfway so if you want to check out all the other stops which you should then youll also need to either buy the train tickets from here or walk the rest of the wayi dont recommend walking back and forth sky capsule tickets can be difficult to get especially at the golden hours if you plan to take this route then id highly recommend booking your reservation well in advance else youll either not get to ride the sky capsule or youll have to wait a long time

 there are options for one way and two way but really once youve seen it one way you dont need to take the ride back
 the best time imo to ride this is around sunset try to make a reservation around this time and youll thank me later

x200b

x200b

 3 you can also take the combo package and save a few 

x200b

 now for the stations  what really is there to see 

1 mipo is the 1st station and is located right beside haeundae beach if youre having a difficult time finding it know that its right behind the lct buildings at the east end of the beach you literally cant miss those buildings because theyre the tallest buildings in the entire area
2 dalmaji  walking trails and the best scenic routes along the entire path if youre leaving from mipo no need to get off here but on the way back then 100 get off here and walk back to mipo its a short walk and the walking trails here were my favorite part of the tourif you want to take some nice pictures  videos walk from dalmaji to mipo at sunset
3 cheongsapo  youll find a red lighthouse close to the ocean nice views but this area actually has good restaurants mostly seafood if you wander around youll find 1 street thats lined with restaurants one popular one has a bunch of tents outside where you can grill various types clams  drink soju
4 daritdol  this stop has the skywalk probably the most popular place to stop at inbetween the 1st and last stop good place to take photos
5 gudeokpo  theres a few cafes around here but there really isnt much to see here so i always skip this area
6 songjeong  this is the 3rd most popular beach in busan if youre looking for restaurants to dine at then this stop is probably your best bet most of the restaurants are further behind the beach rather than lining the beach so youll have to do a little research first on where they are but there are some really good places to eat at around here if you like thai food check out this place   a bam boo the restaurants infront of the beach are soso good for snacks not so much for proper meals but if you want a good quick snack then moon toast cafe right infront of the beach is one of my favorites

 but wait theres more  combine this with 

if youre new to busan and doing this as a part of your day trip then heres my biggest tip when youre at songjeong beach take a cab from here to haedong yonggungsa its one of koreas most beautiful temples the cab ride from here will only be 45 or so the temple is free to go to and if youre looking to feel koreas rich culture and history then this is probably one of the best places to go to in all of busan after checking out the temple you can walk or take a cab over to one of the largest outlet malls thats just down the street or take a cab back to seongjeong beach and from there hop back on the train back towards mipo station 1st stop

as a foreigner who lives here in busan the names of each station can get a little confusing and difficult to remember so if you really want to get familiar with this attraction before visiting then try watching out this video that really breaks everything down perfectly self plug here haha i worked pretty hard at putting this together but if youre visiting busan and need some help with figuring things out 100 this video will clear up any confusion

busan,queen beetle cancelled for octobernovember  travel alternatives fukuokabusan,"i just received a message that the queen beetle ferry from fukuoka to busan is cancelled for all trips from october 1st until november 25th including the trip i booked im now looking for alternatives for the trip to busan preferably without flying i currently have 2 nights booked in fukuoka before the trip to busan and 2 nights in beppu before that so im also considering skipping fukuoka if there are better options 

1 the easiest option would be flying from fukuoka to busan not so keen on that   
2 how about getting a ferry from fukuoka to tsushima island staying 2 nights there and then the ferry to busan from there   
3 taking the slower camellia line ferry at 1230pm arrival at 1830pm  i guess this is the best option if i dont want to fly 

any other ideas "

busan,the air pollution in south korea is absolutely insane,"im a canadian visiting south korea for the first time were afforded an 180 day visa so ive spent several months traveling between seoul jecheon and busan before arriving i watched a number of travel vloggers and a couple of things ive learned after x years in korea videos no one mentioned the pollution problem literally not one person currently im in busan and the aqi is above 200 the little cartoon man on the index is purple and very unhappy i hoped that leaving seoul would alleviate the problem but it has not

besides the pollution my stay has been very nice but the air pollution problem is the first second third fourth and fifth thing you need to know before visiting korea and everyone seems to sidestep mentioning the issue if youre a travel vlogger or an expat living in korea youre not doing anyone any favors by not making the pollution problem exceedingly clear the fact that i didnt know i was walking into this and had to learn on the ground after i arrived is truly baffling"

i f28 have booked my first solo trip to korea in april for 12 days  its my first time visiting korea  im thinking of splitting time between seoul and then busan or jeju island

im a bit overwhelmed researching about where to go and what to do a few questions

1 where in seoul should i stay i want somewhere pretty central that would be a good base to visit the main attractions  am not so much into the nightlife as ill be alone would it be safe to go out alone at night
2 any recommendations for places worth visiting would be amazing 
3 how long should i stay in seoul i was thinking around 6 days is that too long
4 would you visit busan or jeju ive read jeju is difficult to get around unless you hire a car which i would not want to do but maybe i could join a tour also heard mixed feelings about busan
5 should i try to visit both busan and jeju or would that be too much travelling and not enough time in each place
6 are there are tours you would recommend in seoulbusanjeju

thank you so much "

busan,my take of south korea and their cars,"i recently took time off in south korea for the first time like all car enthusiasts i was curious to see what was normally on the road and also had the opportunity to rent and drive there unfortunately i did not get a chance to go to any of the auto museums as we had a packed schedule with inlaws etc this experience comes from seoul busan and jeju island

general observations

local brands hyundai and kia incl genesis dominate the streets this is expected and no surprise there were a lot of models that i didnt recognize grandeurhttpsimgurcomyckzukj  genesis wagonhttpsimgurcomjcbribj  casperhttpsimgurcomwc1fybh  lux vanhttpsimgurcomcut9qav i also noticed that hyundai releases models earlier than the us including the sonata and sante fe it was cool to see future vehicles on the road

foreign brands can also be seen including mbhttpsimgurcomh35eclk renaulthttpsimgurcomcdmtj9r and audihttpsimgurcomb3gyyzo not many bmws surprisingly japanese brands were nonexistent vs what you see in the us could be intentional given the history between the two countries and now that korea has their own successful car models i saw one es hybrid and a couple white altimas in good shape lastly there were exotics but weve all seen these before so ill spare the pics except this 911httpsimgurcomein5xpw

taxis taxis included the ionic 5  6 pichttpsimgurcomhaz6ljb  pichttpsimgurcomzlhbdhq i am impressed with the ionic 5 as it was able to fit all 5 traveling adults our luggage and the driver ill caveat that some of the luggage had to be in the cabin area i would consider a similar type of ev once infrastructure range and charging speed are more developed

misc door sponges apparently these come on new cars to help prevent door dings and owners decide to leave them on after purchasing nice feature look at the picture of the lux van

rental  driving experience

where i got to drive in jeju island not in seoul or busan the general vibe of jeju island is like maui the island is spread out and driving is required to get around vs public transportation

rental i rented a kia carnivalhttpsimgurcomqs1dddq surprisingly this was diesel i only had to fill the tank once driving across the island multiple times this was the perfect size for 5 adults and our luggage i was debating between the van vs a large suv and i feel i made the right choice my brother in law would have had to crawl over the second row everytime we drove somewhere given the amount of time spent driving the extra room was well worth it i see the appeal of vans and would definitely choose them over an suv with 3 rows people are scared of the stigma

what is it like driving in korea jeju only speed camerasspeed cameras everywhere navigation will sound alarms until you pass and traffic adhere to these cameras so i think they are legit you also cant use google maps for real time navigation due to national security and will need to use the local apps including naver or kakao both of these apps are inferior imho and pita to use driving is similar to the us on the right lane and its pretty easy switching to kilometers

overall im not surprised with what i saw or experienced with driving in korea i still like driving in the us and the options that we have hope you found this interesting"
busan,traveling to busan next weekend and had a few questions,"1 is there a recommended time of day to visit yonggungsa temple i dont mind big crowds but it would still be nice to go when its not as busy if possible 

2 are the bookstores on bosu book street typically open on sundays 

last time i made the mistake of going during chuseok i called a ton of the smaller shops and the ones i did get through to said theyd open again on monday so i wasnt sure if it was just because of the holiday or if they are typically closed sundays

3 if anyone could recommend a good restaurant id be grateful ill be traveling alone

busan,first time traveling to korea seoul busan with family questions,"hey all

so excited to be heading back to korea  its my first time since 1993 lived there between 19741980 as a child   it is my wifes and our childrens first time age 13 and 8

weve narrowed down our dates and have our lodging secured

we are staying in seoul march 30april 3rd
busan april 3rd april 5th
back to seoul april 59th

we do know there is some fantastic things happening during this time cherry blossoms and that the weather at this time of year is pleasant

both of our stays in seoul are fairly close to the gyeongbukgong palace area to the west of it  first stay is close seoul museum of history and the second closer to sejong village food street

our stay in busan is in haeundaegu busan

some
questions 

1  ive seen the main airport used is incheon as it is newer and has more amenities  but ive read gimpo is actually closer to seoul  would gimpo make sense with avaiable public transportation to my locations west of gyeongbokgung place area

2 also ive read that transportation on subways in the city are difficult during commute times  what is the typical commute time 6am9am and 3pm6pm

3 while our stats are close to many of the cultural landmarks in central seoul  how challenging is the travel to places like hongdae and myeongdong insadong etc

4  advice for travel across the han river to lotte world   taxi  bus  subway

5 closest egg drop to seoul museum of historysejong food village areas

6  personal recommendations for things to do with kidsfamily we are already eyeing the nanta theater show  trick eye museum and lotteworld  my 13 yo would likely be interested in the dmz  the war history museum  my 8 year old daughter would likely enjoy fungirly specialty cafes and arcades  any kind of kpop themed activities  my wife would love to do some shopping for skin care products  and maybe some amazing cafes and spas  id be interested in more cultural sites of importance and other cultural sites

6 any other tips and tricks  advice for first time traveller  things you wish you knew before you went etc  im already researching cell phone sim cards  taxisubway cards  and compatible device charges

thank you very much"

busan,seoulbusan trip and tips for solo traveler,"hello everyone im 26m from philippines ill be solo traveling to south korea i just booked my flight to incheon arriving on oct 29 evening and departing from busan on nov 6

im planning to stay in seoul from 5 days then off to busan for 3 days would love any tips or suggestions

heres my general itinerary
seoul
oct 29 evening  arrival
oct 30  myeongdong namsan itaewon
oct 31  gyeongbokgung bukchon hanok
nov 1  dmz
nov 2  nami islandpetit france
nov 3  transit to busan
nov 4  gamcheon culture village

nov 6  last minute exploration departure 

is 3 days enough in busan i havent decided yet whether ill move my transit to busan on november 4 or ill stick with november 3 im just thinking i might have lesser time in seoul"
busan,traveling to korea heres some advice ,"please note this is my experience and opinions

1 transportation 
public transportation is great here
i used public transportation in busan and seoul didnt really have an issue except on one day where they closed some parts of the city for a marathon 
theres usually a bus every 10 minutes
dont forget to tap in and out of the bus

uber and kakao t
i used the uber app way more than kakao t
you can select pay in person if you want to pay in cash or using a prepaid debit card
if using cash i gave the exact amount so i am unsure if they offer change 
the cost of using uberkakao isnt too bad but if theresa traffic the price does go up


if you are traveling with multiple large luggages please make your life easier and call use a taxi
at the airport you would usually have to cross the street to get a jumbo taxi  4050 usd 
hotels will also help call a taxi for you on the way back to the airport just let them know in advance

2 payment methods
i used cash credit cards and wowpass
i loved all three and if i were to come back i would still use all three payment methods

cash transportation tmoney reload and uber street food and light shopping

credit cards transportation uber shopping and restaurants
make sure to press korea when buying stuff i chose americausd and got charged 4 even though my cards have do not have foreign exchange fees


wowpass currency exchange transportation public and uber restaurants and shopping 
pros 
the currency exchange rate with wowpass is actually great better than most banks 
only had to use one card for shopping and transportation 
can check balance of the card and tmoney on the app
cons
not enough machines in the city 


3 esim or pocket wifi 
i reserved the airport package with wowpass and received an esim
the data is great didnt have any issues with it
there is wifi almost everywhere you go 

i chose esim over pocket wifi because i didnt want to carry another item in my bag and worry about losing it and having to charge it 

you also get a korean number havent had to use it other than getting my pictures sent to me through text 

4 other things
be prepared to walk and stand
so wear the right shoes 

if youre planning on taking your drink to go you wont be able to bring it on public transportation 
so chug that drink lol 

dont do too much in one day plan realistically
also dont underestimate jet lag and traveling to your accommodation on the first day 

cultural differences 
dont get offended if people accidentally shove or push you and they dont say sorryexcuse me im from the us and this was a shocking experience

bathroom
they dont have toilet seat covers 
prepare to squat or wipe down the seat
they have signs not to flush the toilet paper 


prices
shopping and eating is a hit or miss with the prices
its usually about the same price as back in america 
even convenience stores are kind of pricey
not sure if it was in the area i was in 


if i remember anything else ill edit this post
if you have any advice please comment below "

busan,traveling from gyeongju to busan during chuseok,"update at bottom of post

my friends and i have planned a trip to korea and we completely overlooked the fact that we would want to travel during chuseok

we currently plan on traveling from gyeongju to busan on on 28th of september first day of chuseok where we will stay for 3 days

were wondering whether we will be able to book a train ticket from gyeongju to busan and what we can expect from chuseok in busan will we need to get some groceries in advance or will restaurantsstores be open

thanks a lot in advance

x200b



chuseok update for further reference 20230928
we decided to take a chance and came to the conclusion there was nothing to worry about

initially train tickets sold out within minutes but a week later a lot of train slots opened up and we were able to acquire 3 seats getting to gyeongju station from our hotel was easy it took 2 minutes to find an uber willing to take us the train was not full at all and were in an uber to our airbnb in busan now

seems like chuseok is not too much of a problem for travelers outside of seoul at least in this part of the country"

busan,travel to korea for festa 2025,"hello i am currently planning on traveling to south korea and being there starting june 10th 2025 or so and being there for 2 weeks i will be going solo so i was wondering if there was anyone else in the group planning on going solo that would like to create a group dm me if youre interested 

planning on staying in seoul around festa days for any events then heading to busan gyeongju and jeju island so far but dont have any concrete plans for after festa 

info on me im will be 24 next year and have been an army since 2020 i am from the united states my biases are jimin and jhope ive never been to a full bts concert but i went to jhopes lollapalooza set and sugas dday tour "
busan,im in a toxic relationship and i want to escape from this,"im just a  who recently moved to busan for work and i want to ask for your help regarding my korean girlfriend we met on a dating app in busan 7 months ago and she was super nice and kind for the first 2 or 3 months however she completely lost her mind i feel embarrassed to share this but i need your help or thoughts on this
first she used to talk poorly about her exes describing them as loser boyfriends who were too desperate her first boyfriend lasted about 2 years she said she kinda used him proudly saying how stupid he wasand then who ran and ghosted her after being together for 6 months now i really understand why he left her because he was not an idiot she has never lived abroad only traveled but she is oddly obsessed with european guysonly specific nationality talking poorly about exes is a red flag but at that time i was lonely and had just moved to busan she always drove me around she has a carand showed nice place and korean culture  so i ignored these red flags


then she started to mentally and physically abuse me demanding a lot whenever i went out with coworkers she asked me to answer her texts within 20 minutes or she went crazy and called me 20times until i responded even though i never cheated and showed her my phone she is the one who cheated randomly sending messages to other foreigners and got caught however when she hung out with friends she never picked up the phone and would tell me   dont bother me and she always called me  fat pig theres no respect

she lives in a poor area in busan and insists she has no money but she always does her hair has surgery and owns saint laurent and gucci bags claiming that this is the korean girl way she manipulated me and made me think it was korean culture but my korean coworkers say shes crazy

to be honest shes notpretty even with a lot of korean plastic surgery just an averagelooking girl and does so much photoshop on her ig photos and her kakao is a completely different person than the photo that i took and she always got super mad because im such a bad photographer and despite her not that good appearancefar from korean beauty standard looks dont really justify being judgmental but just pointed out her situation  she always commented on other men or girls who are in the street or restaurant all these things happened and there are more but i will just not say this time and i decided to move on from her lastly i dont know why i kept this relationship

crazy things happened last night im going to visit my family for christmas for 2 weeks and she wants to follow i have no intention of bringing this crazy woman to my family or thinking about our relationship going long term and definitely im not gonna marry her i want to stay with someone who is considerate and can have a mature relationship not her being 28 years old we cant even talk about stuff other than korean culture and her english is limited i said to her directly about my feelings and she went crazy comparing her ex apparently they brought her to their family and provided all expenses for a whole europe tour which is hard to believe but thats what she said and she wants to break up with me i said okay immediately and blocked her on kakao but she went crazy calling me 30 times in a row and now she is waiting in front of my apartment i really want to get rid of this toxic crazy woman in my life but dont know what to do is anyone who has a similar experience please tell me or can i actually report to the police this is crazy

edit i get too many comments to reply all but thank you guys

those who live in busan please avoid this woman at all costs she is only fixated on a european guy who can supposedly save her lifejobless she quit the job after we are together ive noticed her consistently following and texting foreigner guys on instagram i was naive but after almost seven months i realized this is complete nonsense shes not worth more than being underground i dont want to sound mean but its been the worst dating experience of my life im currently at my friends home and will go back home tomorrow after work thank you so much for your concern i really appreciate it i feel bad for those who have experienced this nonsense we all deserve better one more thing yes i admit i was an idiot this time it may sound like an excuse if i were in norway  i will never dare to date someone who is mentally unstable and sicklike her ii had serious relationships with girls from my country but in korea i had no one and she was the first option on the dating app i was probably too lonely in foreign country i  blocked her on everything and i will call the cops tomorrow if she is still around thank you again"
busan,i need advice deciding if i want to travel to a place thats natural and relaxing or going to a major city like bangkok busan or lyon,for mental health reasons i decided to take a trip in july or august however i havent decided what vibe i am going for this would be the first time i am traveling and its highly possible ill be going solo the thing is ive always wanted to visit the places thailand south korea and lyon but now that i think about it in my current situation i think it would be better to visit a beautiful place thats relaxing instead because im really searching to just wind down from stress and anxiety and im not sure if sk or thailand will give me that any advice
busan,1 week solo travel in march  cities to visit other than busan jeju gyeongju etc,"so ive been to seoul busan jeju gyeongju daegu seoraksan in sokcho tongyeong and geoje still intending to keep a few days for seoul and probably also jeonju 

1 what other places should i visit i travel mostly for food all sorts seafood etc but i also would like something new dont mind squeezing in a mountain climb etc or interesting places new experiences good museums etc random things i was considering were paragliding in danyang or going to the ginseng market in geumsan but im worried theres nothing else to do in those places

2 im thinking if its a good idea to fly in from another airport maybe gwangju or cheongju ktx to jeonju and then fly out from seoul is that recommended any nice cities around gwangjucheongju thats en route to jeonju

 general updates

this patch is a rebase and will require a large download for all platforms check out our forums for more information 104httpsusforumsblizzardcomenoverwatchtaboutupdatingoverwatch2inseason4800540

 accessibility

added a setting to select custom colors for health armor shields and overhealth in health bars improved preview feature for custom color settings with different preview backgrounds

 stranded spawn system

regrouping with your team after getting stranded in a spawn room has never been easier spawn rooms that shut down due to capturing or losing an objective will now remain partially active for 7 seconds while you still cant change heroes in these spawn rooms other new features have been activated in these stranded spawns the doors remain locked to the opposing team the healing field remains active and you can now use the interact key to instantly teleport to the new active spawn room

 matchmaking

backfilling players in unranked modes will now prioritize finding players closer to the skill level of the other players in the match minor optimizations for large groups improving matchmaking quality

 competitive updates

 top 500 leaderboard eligibility

players will now be required to win 25 competitive matches before being eligible to enter the top 500 leaderboard for a specific role queue or region

developer comments previously we only required 25 games to be completed regardless of winning prior to becoming eligible for the top 500 leaderboards however this change should help make sure that players are consistently pushing toward winning matches which should help ensure the leaderboards have the best players in each region

 competitive leaver penalty changes

matches left in different competitive queues are still considered separate for purposes of determining the lengths of suspensions or receiving a seasonal ban from competitive play

the start of a new competitive season also no longer fully resets the severity of these suspensions and bans this should hopefully prevent players from leaving competitive games at the end of a season without facing meaningful consequences at the start of the next

matches left in competitive play will also have a more negative effect on a players skill tier and division after a 5win competitive update

 competitive point reward changes

the number of competitive points cp rewarded for a win in competitive play has been changed from 15 to 25

the number of competitive points earned from seasonal challenges based on your final seasonal rank has also been updated games played after your last competitive update during a season will still count towards your final seasonal rank you must still compete in the seasons competitive play qualification challenge to receive bonus competitive points

 ending in bronze will now earn 300 competitive points previously 65
 ending in silver will now earn 450 competitive points previously 125
 ending in gold will now earn 600 competitive points previously 250
 ending in platinum will now earn 800 competitive points previously 500
 ending in diamond will now earn 1000 competitive points previously 750
 ending in masters will now earn 1200 competitive points previously 1250
 ending in grand masters will now earn 1500 competitive points previously 1750

 competitive challenge titles

seasonal competitive titles earned from challenges now distinguish between whether they are earned in open queue or role queue for example

 ending in diamond rank in open queue will earn the diamond open challenger title
 ending in diamond rank in role queue will earn the diamond role challenger title

developer comments the goal of these changes is to prevent confusion about a players rank from the previous season if they participate in multiple competitive queues

 competitive match rank

the initial loading screen that shows all the participants of competitive matches will now show an icon at the top of the screen representing the average skill tier and division of all players in that match this should provide players with a better comparison of their own rank to other players in the match

 seasonal rank decay removed

starting with season four a players competitive play rank will no longer be reduced at the beginning of a season furthermore the effects of this reduction of rank from previous seasons will also be removed depending on how many games they played during the previous season most players will see their skill tier and division increase a players skill tier and division at the beginning of season 4 will now closely match the matchmakers estimate of your current skill

developer comments the previous seasonal rank decay was causing considerable confusion for players who would see players in their competitive games who did not appear to be of a similar rank often these players were actually of similar skill but they had not played enough games during the season to compensate for the initial decay

 competitive skill update and progression

both the competitive progress and competitive update screens will now include information about a players losses and ties as well as their wins

the competitive update screen will also now provide players with an indication of their current percentage progress within a skill division this will hopefully make it more clear how the results of games played during the update affect a players skill tier and division

it is possible for players to have a positive winloss record but not go up a skill division because the progress occurs entirely within a single division this new message will allow players to see that they did in fact make positive progress just not enough to reach a new skill tier or division

there is also a similar message with competitive updates for players who are grandmaster 1 but not yet on the top 500 leaderboard this should provide those players with feedback about their progress towards earning a spot on the top 500 leaderboard

 hero updates

 tank

reinhardt

 armor health reduced from 300 to 250
 base health increased from 175 to 200

developer comment reinhardt has been overperforming after the recent increases to his offensive capabilities those changes have been playing well so to adjust his overall power were reducing his overall health through this armor reduction

sigma

accretion

 impact damage reduced from 60 to 40 80 damage total with explosion
 knockdown duration increased from 08 to 11 seconds

developer comment like roadhogs chain hook sigmas accretion and primary fire combo can be highly lethal and can feel like a guaranteed kill against 200 health targets were reducing the damage slightly to require an additional volley of primary fire but are also increasing the stun duration to provide allies with more opportunity to follow up on successful impacts

 damage

cassidy

 base health reduced from 225 to 200

magnetic grenade

 damage reduced from 131 to 120

developer comment magnetic grenade only requiring one additional primary fire shot after sticking to a target was too reliable to execute on even though it only works at close range were reducing the total damage on magnetic grenade evenly split between the direct target damage and explosion the reduced falloffdamage buff his primary fire received recently enables cassidy to play from safer engagement ranges now so were reducing his health back to 200

sombra

 emp can now disable blizzard

developer comment we are expanding what sombras emp turns off to keep it consistent with how it affects other devicecontrolled ultimates

 support

ana

sleep dart

 maximum duration on tank heroes reduced 30 from 5 to 35 seconds

developer comments weve been watching how effective sleep dart has been in 5v5 gameplay it hasnt been overly disruptive as a whole but since it is significantly more reliable to land against tank heroes due to their large hit boxes and even more valuable to do so with only one tank on the field were reducing its maximum duration against those targets

brigitte

rally

 brigitte now gains 100 restorable armor health pool for the duration of rally
 brigitte no longer gradually builds temporary health like her nearby allies
 rally now upgrades her barrier shield increasing both its size and health
 barrier health increased from 300 to 750 during the ultimate
 during rally shield bash now impacts multiple enemies and briefly stuns them
 bonus movement speed reduced from 30 to 15

repair pack

 range reduced from 30 to 25 meters

developer comments rally lost some of its power with the change from granting allies additional armor to temporary health and overall took a relatively long time to build up its defensive benefits this rework is intended to keep it as a defensive ultimate ability but with a more immediate impact due to gaining an increased armor health pool upfront and the enhanced barrier which can be utilized to block for teammates while their temporary health builds or interrupt enemies with the stun

mercy

caduceus staff

 healingpersecond increased from 45 to 55
 healing is no longer increased for allies under half health

guardian angel

 cooldown reduced from 25 to 15 seconds
 jump and crouch cancel active ability state duration increased from 10 to 15 seconds
 the jump and crouch cancel active ability state can no longer be manually interrupted to begin the cooldown early

valkyrie

 support role passive healing is now active for the duration of valkyrie

developer comment the recent increase to guardian angels jumpcancel mobility still needs to be kept in check in some way but while the last iteration was simple it also had some unintended effects such as not being ready to use ga again after flying in and using resurrect this revision provides more flexibility and allows mercy to opt into an additional 15 second cooldown when using the increased mobility from the jumpcrouch cancel options or otherwise waiting for the base cooldown time

the increased healing multiplier condition on caduceus staff was intended to help mercy players feel more agency in trying to save criticalhealth allies and to add depth to the healing mechanic without changing the total time to heal to full health however the overall rebalance of the healing values received significant negative feedback both from those playing as mercy and those playing against it there wasnt a satisfying middle ground where we could reduce the potency of this effect while still having it feel impactful so were reverting it

moira

fade

 can now be activated during coalescence

coalescence

 bonus movement speed reduced from 50 to 40

biotic grasp

 lingering heal duration increased from 2 to 3 seconds

developer comments being able to use fade during her coalescence ultimate gives moira more playmaking ability by being able to reposition even more quickly and avoid potential threats with quick reactions due to the more spreadout playstyle of 5v5 were increasing the lingering heal duration from her primary fire meaning it will heal more in total

busan,a sad realization from an american abroad ,"for the past six months i have been teaching english in south korea  i am paid a fair wage saving money every month  i have been living my life day by day in a way i havent been able to my whole life  it is an interesting change from my life in california  

every day for these past six months i have woken up with the knowledge that if i am ever sick or hurt i can go to a medical clinic see a doctor in 10mins and either be heading towards the hospital across the street or in the pharmacy downstairs in 15mins

this is possible because of the nationalized healthcare  the total cost of a massive bronchitis tonsillitis month was 19 usd less than the copay to see a doctor under my plan at home

if at any moment i would like to travel to the south end of the country in busan i can get there in three hours at almost any time  if i want a slower option i can get anywhere in the whole country from where i am right now 

that may not seem like much for folks from my home country who will immediately point out that the usa is huge and south korea is tiny in comparison  fine  however i will say that even on a state level  i have been nowhere in the states with this beautiful of an infrastructure for travel  i havent paid for gas in 6 months i dont know how to express what a difference that makes in a budget

that may have been a bit of a lengthy lead in to my sad realization  if i go home i am vulnerable to being sick without healthcare stranded without a car my profession is laughed at and disrespected and education funding is almost gone in my state  a wave of horrible depression overcame my usual carefree nature when i realized i have a better life here than i have ever had or am likely to have at home  

reddit has made me realize i am not alone in my fears about the future of my country

edit i will answer almost any questions you all have for me  430am kst is pushing the limits to my ability to competently answer questions  see you all in the morning
slug

edit aaaannd im back nice to be on the front page of politics when you wake up  this isnt really where i expected this post to go i thought it would hang around the new area fizzle and die  i love my home and my country the sad realization is how much happier i have been away from it  i have a job security here that as a teacher in california is impossible  i love every minute of teaching and every day i look for new ways to improve my style and effectiveness  i left highschool with the hope that one day i would be able to inspire kids to love a subject as much as i loved my favorite teachers subjects

i dont want this to tun into an everything is better on the other side rant  that wasnt my intent  my intent was to point out the aspects of my new life here that i cherish and how they contrast to my experiences at home

i think we can all learn from one another  sitting idly by dismissing any criticism of the united states is silly  my experience here as a teacher is far better than my experience at home  that is a fact  the united states could learn something from south korea  that is an opinion  other countries could learn a few things from the us that is also an opinion  

i like the up votes to down votes ratio right now  it seems like i have said something horribly controversial

edit i got rid of the part about used to be proud of seemed a little gratuitous put in a needed pluralpossessive apostrophe i love those

aaand i am out  this shit is tiring  pm me if you live in seoul and want to meet up some time for a beer or coffee"

busan,i love living here,"since moving back to korea a few months ago life has never been better this is such a wonderful and beautiful country filled with wonderful and beautiful people 

theres so much to do and so much to see the food is great the culture is amazing and the people are overall very friendly i can walk at night and not feel unsafe like i did back in the states i love it i work in a cafe in a city near busan its my hometown and i love it 

of course its not all sunshine and rainbows but no country is it has its positives and negatives just like any other country but its mostly positive

i wouldnt suggest moving here because of kpopkdramas without doing further research on the country those are strictly for entertainment only also id highly suggest traveling outside of the big cities try out the countrysides people tend to be warmer and less uptight in my experience in my area i dont really feel pressured to keep up with beauty standards like i would in seoul

id gladly share more if you have any questions feel free to ask

busan,travelling from seoul to gurye to busan,"hi all i plan to travel to gurye from seoul and spend 3  4 days there and after that travel to busan so what i found from naver is that i have to take the out of town bus from seoul nambu bus terminal but how do i know what is the exact bus to take when im there but most importantly is there a better way to travel to these 2 places or is it better to just take the ktx from seoul to busan and take a day trip to gurye thank you

busan,korea trip review,"29m from india finally went to korea with my sister our first international trip and i miss it already fell in love with everything will try to breakdown below 

transport  this was my first international trip so i cant really compare with any other country but in comparison with my own country traveling and understanding the train and bus system was really really easy and time efficient

navigation  it was so great and naver map really is a saviour as it precisely shows which train or bus to take where to get down and which exit to take from station learned how to navigate on first day itself and thats it i was traveling like a pro as if ive been living in korea for many years

people  although they may seem rude or ignorant at first but i was wrong theyre the sweetest when you speak with them if they know english theyll go above and beyond to help you even if they dont theyll still try everyone spoke with us with smiles on their faces

old people have my hearttheyll make you feel like their own child if you dont know how to eat something in their food stall theyll try to show an old lady running a restaurant gave us sweets before we left

racism  before going to korea many articles youtubers and reddit post made me feel anxious about getting discriminated but guess what i experienced no racism at all nobody changed their seats on metro or bus when we sat beside them nobody made us feel unsafe infact i was roaming everywhere without any fear spoke with locals without hesitation

while seoul was easy going and relaxed but busan i really couldnt connect not degrading the city just like i said before people are sweetest but both old and young people in busan couldnt speak english so it was a bit difficult and its not there fault we got few looks from oldies but we didnt mind

shopping  i went with my sister and it was paradise for her but for men i feel clothes are expensive correct me if im wrong

food  ill belive if someone is vegan or pure vegetarian will have bit of a hard time finding suitable food those who eat non veg should be open to trying other meat items as chicken is not served in every place correct me if im wrong

papago for translation klook to book activities and naver for navigation are must have apps

feel free to ask me anything or correct me if said anything wrong"

busan,translation inven interview with faker  what keeps the legend living,"article link koreanhttpswwwinvencokrwebzinenewsnews271910

video link koreanhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcj453w2ai0

inven has released an hourlength interview with faker where he talks deeply about his motivators the current state of esports and his view of the future ive taken the time to translate the text as below ive added some words in brackets to aid understanding

 inven interview with faker  what keeps the legend living

by reporters arrah kibaek nam dohyun lee

x200b

after confirming an interview with faker this reporter was more worried than excited my most pressing concern was how to fully make use of the precious 1 hour given to me and how to convey his thoughts with clarity even while covering the 2022 msi group stage in busan an interview with faker kept its presence known in the corner of my mind  however the interview went more smoothly than i expected there was a bit of nervousness mixed in at the start but as we started talking the conversation never dangled this may be the reporters speculation but faker also grew more comfortable as 5 minutes 10 minutes passed you look very happy when talking about money he even joked thus the interview was ended after a full hour  money was the strongest motivator for the faker of 2013 as he had chosen the road less traveled he thought that he needed to earn a wage to begin with after he earned as much as he needed the desire to overcome challenges a bit of mannerism and a sense of responsibility were the things that drove him on he desired to challenge himself to winning even more he wanted to keep on winning like he had and he felt he had to do his best since that was his role  the faker of 2022 now with countless trophies under his belt still desires for the next championship and works tirelessly what is the driving force behind this living legend

x200b

icebreaking 2022 msi

lets begin our interview with good news youve finished the group stage without dropping a single game

obviously my goal was to do that in my mind msi really starts from the rumble stage and i treated this phase as a time to adapt and played without much care there was a bit of a hassle adapting to the new ping but i think ive adapted sufficiently to it and my gameplay quality has shown that i have as well the ping was noticeably smoother on the last day but for the days before that it was around 50 ping now it feels like 35 its much smoother now

youre said to be very sensitive to such ingame measures you must have felt very uncomfortable

since the mid laning phase itself and how to play out the game as a mid laner is affected quite heavily by a single skillshot i think there are many mid laners who are sensitive to ping changes im an outlier in that front obviously im not showing 100 of my full skill but ive had much experience adapting to a slower ping so its not that big of an obstacle

x200b

although it is in progress this msi has had many shortcomings so far

the 2022 msi is held in korea but with all the hiccups i personally felt a bit disappointed by the host company remaking games it can be very intolerable by teams i think the remake happened because riot failed to organize the tournament properly there were other problems as well as ping so i think those make this tournament not what i expected

x200b

the 1st story v10 and 9 years of faker

whats the difference between your tenth lck championship and your first

my biggest motivator for my first championship was money to be a pro gamer its like youve turn from the path of finishing school and getting a normal job with all the security it offers so when i first started out i was hungry for a victory so i could earn money however after winning over the course of several years i earned as much as i needed and that motivator faded afterwards how many trophies could i lift up as a pro gamer that was my goal its like a personal challenge of mine but its also because ive kept winning obviously i tried harder since its my job and what ive been doing for a long time

however my most recent driving force is selfimprovement i really want to improve myself as a gamer as a result on the surface im aiming for winning championships which is a must for a pro gamer but on the inside my first priority is working hard to improve my skill as a player more than winning

x200b

youve been famous for practicing heavily as time went on your schedule must have become more packed has that impacted your practice time in any way

firstly my schedule has always been packed however its true that im definitely practicing less than i used to in 2013 i would play for 15 hours a day but now i only play 1012 the key to keeping up these hours even with a busy schedule is my desire to win i absolutely abhor losing if i fall behind i get angry and practice more

x200b

how did you keep your desire to win constant over the course of 10 years

my personality plays a big part im the type to see the end of whatever im interested in im also someone who likes to dig in deep how to play betterim always thinking of stuff like that

x200b

what about your health its a mustfactor in longevity as a gamer

physically i have nothing that can take me away from gaming mentally i dont think im in good shape right now and i need to try harder in that aspect as a pro gamer i think of mental health as how hard i can concentrate on the game right now i think i have many shortcomings in concentrating and maintaining peak form so im working on those

x200b

you seem to be the type to find things to improve on and work on them what do you think youve improved in the most

in the past i was a bit more selffocused and uhi would look at the trees instead of the forest now ive improved heavily in that aspect ive changed the most in that im now trying to take in more ideas to grow in different ways

the biggest factor in how ive changed is reading books i came by a book in 2015 and read it a few times and i think theyve changed me into becoming a more open and receptive person and these individual changes were the driving force in how i would act this also helped a lot in extending my career as a pro gamer

x200b

youre famous for reading as a hobby do you have any books you recommend

right now im reading books about neuroscience and psychology but its a niche genre even in the past i would read stodgy titles which is an acquired taste so i dont think i can recommend any books fans have listed all the books ive read so instead of my recommendation you can look at them and pick one you think sounds fun every book ive read has helped me in some way and there were no books that werent fun

x200b

have you experienced being comforted by books

i had read several books about comforting and theyve helped me every time reading something in itself is a very comforting action i think this is supported by science sometimes i feel my stress levels drop when i read

x200b

if you read books to help your everyday mental health id like to expand that into a question of how you keep calm ingame

first off i almost am never stressed out during pro play so i dont really need a method to keep calm i almost never get angry or excited when playing since im always focused on the game state itself when practicing i sometimes whine or get touchy whenever that happens i just hold it in or let time take care of it

x200b

not having emotional fluctuations in game seems to be another ingredient for your longevity in fact the talk of the house seems to be the resurgence of veterans like yourself faker

i think its to be expected ive never thought that the lifespan of pro gamers should be short its natural that some will retire and some will not its also a given that there will be veterans who are good and others who arent i never had any preconceptions about age if we move past their age its natural to have good players and bad players

x200b

the scene seems to be much more receptive and nonprejudiced about age than before

in the past it was difficult to know how to extend player longevity during the starcraft days players would retire in their mid20s however looking at the physical and mental requirements lol demands theyre different from what starcraft requires so i thought that players would be more longlived for example lol is much less wristintensive than starcraft is that might be a factor in why players can play for longer periods

x200b

break time faker most  moments

fakers most spectacular moment

2013 i had so much drive and there was so much stimulation and novel experiences i think spectacular is the perfect term to describe that year

x200b

fakers most explosive moment

i think its 2013 im most satisfied with my play back then

x200b

fakers most happiest moment

as a pro gamer it would be 2013

x200b

lee sanghyeoks most happiest moment

it would still be 2013 when i first won a championship thats burned into my mind

x200b

fakers most hardworking moment

2016 i was gaming in a daze and i suffered many slumps then

x200b

fakers most difficult moment

last year i had lost confidence in myself and there were many trying moments it was a turbulent year

x200b

the moment i want to return to

when i was in elementary school everyone might be like this but i was happy when i was young so i want to go back to being a child if possible with the memories i have now since if my brain is wiped ill repeat my life when i was young i would skip homework and play instead of studying if i go back i would study more and find a girlfriend ill do the everyday stuff the stuff you can only do when youre a child

x200b

the 2nd story faker and t1

its not an easy feat being a oneclub player what do you think kept you with t1 ever since your debut

quality of life since i play in korea its more comfortable for me and korean food is the best from a pro gamers perspective i thought i would have the highest chance of winning when i stayed in korea there are other reasons than that but to keep it short those are my reasons

x200b

this can be a sensitive question but there were rumors your recent resigning didnt go smoothly

i also think my resigning this year was very rough every signing has been back in 201314 when i was clueless it was easy but since 2015 every single signing was difficult

x200b

from t1s ceo joe marsh its been known you refused a 20 million offer if its not the money what keeps faker going

money is the most important but there are other things to consider i received several offers and resigned after considering various factors money is just another factor

x200b

from the skt days to the t1 of now the organization has grown as well there are more sponsors and now a new gaming hq you must have played a big role do you feel anything about this

i always thought that t1 was already a matured esports gaming organization even when they were skt so i dont think ive played any role in that obviously my contribution as a star player of the org exists but that wasnt due to any desire of mine it happened naturally thats why i dont think i contributed anything  t1 and i are in a symbiotic relationship just like i work hard t1 treats me well as our contract stipulates so theres no waxing poetic about that

x200b

will you stay with t1 forever

since anything can happen during resignings i cant give a concrete answer to that im focused on playing well as a t1 player

x200b

the 3rd story faker and esports

the prestige of esports is soaring it may be noticeable to you as you appear on diverse multimedia platforms

compared to before pro gamers have become more attractive to the 3040 demographic and so ive received more calls to appear on tv and more premium treatment i was treated well when i first appeared on tv but it has only gotten better people are more polite and respectful

x200b

esports has been selected as an official event for the asian games

its a natural case of supply following demand the esports market will continue to grow for 3040 years personally i expect the olympics to have an esports event in 10 years i think its very possible as long as there arent any organizational mistakes like this msi controversy

x200b

the korean government is also taking notice the yoon administration has announced its plan to create home stadiums for esports

honestly i dont know well about home stadiums so i cant say much i dont watch a lot of baseball so im uninformed but i do think that esports doesnt really need home stadiums as others have said

x200b

going back to lol youve garnered interest for talking about the state of soloqueue during your live stream are you utilizing your hotline

yes when i suspect a troll i report them however if theyre sneaky about it its hard to find its a complicated issue both for players and riot recently the number of blatant trolls has decreased but another problem is the quality of games  each soloqueue games quality overly fluctuates i think its related to targeted throwing but i dont think i can elaborate on that

x200b

you werent the type to speak out on these issues but recently youve been more vocal and it has led to good outcomes is there a reason for this change

its not something ive tried to make happen but i was so stressed out that i had an emotional outbreak thankfully the fans looked well on it and it ended okay but i will try to be more reasonable in the future i dont feel any pressure to speak out as the media refers to additionally it may be fine to publicly discuss these matters but the best course of action is to find a solution between the involved parties in whatever case

x200b

the ending

personally i think theres a special difference between a layperson and an outlier in their field what is your special difference what is fakers greatest weapon

in my case i think i was extremely lucky i dont think im any different from other people my personality has been very helpful in working as a pro gamer but its not like you can create your own personality i think the environment is 100 responsible for how your personality develops my environment getting into a good team and meeting good teammates that was how i could keep playing and keep winning

x200b

im not talking about retirement but im curious about the faker 10 years from now

im not sure ive tried to envision it but i would draw a blank what i want for me 10 years from now is to be prosperous peaceful and happy maybe have a religion and cultivate my inner peace i think that would be the best for me and ill be happy that way i dont think where i am will be important

x200b

my last question might be one youre familiar with but its still powerful what are your fans to faker

my fans are the giver of the greatest of joys i think theres no difference between my fans and myself the fans are my joy and i am their joy as well if i work hard for myself i believe my fans will be happy too in conclusion i think my fans are my driving force to work hard ill try harder to obtain a good result for this msi"
busan,trip report around the world in nine months,"i just returned from my trip and figured i could write a review for you guys im 22m and from germany i saved up the money for this trip in beforehand during my apprenticeship and while working 

budget

i tracked my budget very accurately using trexpense i compiled it into a spreadsheet herehttpsimgurcomaxed7owa i spent a little more than 1500 on international flights and around 12500 in total    
additionally there were costs for vaccinations and insurance

trip length     

i started my journey on october 4th 2022 and ive been travelling for 270 days now it was the time i had roughly intended initially 

destinations

southeastern europe six weeks i made my way from germany to istanbul over the course of six weeks mostly on the adriatic coast in hindsight it looks very rushed to me but at the time it felt right as i wanted to see as much as possible    
my favs were croatia montenegro bnh and albania budapest and istanbul were amazing aswell i will for sure go back to several of these countries and take more time 

southeastasia     
 thailand three weeks made my way from bangkok north    
 laos two weeks took the slowboat to luang prabang and went from north to south    
 cambodia 25 weeks i spent christmas and new years there    
 vietnam three weeks hcmc to hanoi by train timing was not the best as the trains were packed because of vietnamese new year and then i was stuck in ha long for a few days    
 back to thailand two weeks did the southern islands including full moon party on koh panh ngan koh tao was the highlight though 

eastasia    
 south korea 25 weeks  seoul to busan with a few stops inbetween was surprised how cheap it was but i guess i was there out of season and it was fucking cold february but was really interesting as i literally met only three other western tourists    
 japan 25 weeks fukuoka to tokyo using the 2 week jr pass more expensive but cheaper than expected most expensive part was the jr pass

america    
 usa 15 weeks didnt do that much in la japan was intense but it was really cool i saw keanu reaves in hollywood and went to a basketball game went for a concert to las vegas then crossed the border from san diego to tijuana airport    
 mexico five weeks first did the copper canyon trip report herehttpswwwredditcomrsolotravelcomments12dahhmtripreportcoppercanyonmexicoutmsourceshareutmmediumandroidapputmnameandroidcssutmterm1utmcontent2 and then went to guadalajara and made my way south its a huge country i feel like i barely scratched the surface fav places were copper canyon guanajuato puebla and san cristbal    
 guatemala five weeks three week spanish course at lago atitlan and two weeks travel including acatenango hike and flores
 el salvador two weeks santa ana pacific coast suchitoto not very touristy cheap buses and very nice people
 costa rica one week la fortuna manuel antonio and uvita too fast to do this country justice but i had only one week left and wanted to make the most of it 

food

before this trip i wouldnt have described myself as a foodie but now i am    
there is so much good food almost everywhere in europe i usually prepared my own breakfast and went for streetfood later in the day    
in sea i only ate street food it was awesome same in korea where most hostels had breakfast included in japan i got most of my stuff from 711 familymart and the like    
in the us i prepared all my food going out was crazy expensive food in mexico is awesome and always spicy but i loved it but i do think there is something as too many tacos after mexico the food in the rest of central america was a little underwhelming 

accommodation

i almost exclusively stayed in hostelshotelsguesthouses with shared dorms although i would describe myself as an introvert i didnt feel the need to take private rooms as i was often enough the only guest or there were not that many people and most places offered some privacy with podscurtains    
in europe i used hostelworld in asia agoda and in america booking depending on where i felt i had the mostcheapest options not sure how big a difference it made though

activities
    
free walking tours hikes guided tours pubcrawls renting motorbikes spanish classes  

what went right

 general structure of the trip as this was my first time doing a trip like this easy start and transition to different culturegetting used to the travel lifestyle in europe  good backpacker infrastructure in asia  central america big language barrier and most difficultdangerous    
 being on my own a lot of the time reading and podcasts helped a lot but sure i missed my friendsfamily especially during the last leg of my trip i am happy to be back for now 
 budget was a little more than planned but i had some leeway there are always things that dont work out and usually end up being more costly and more money usually means more fun    
 backpack osprey farpoint 40 would use it again could have a few more small pockets though i took the fleecejacket out for flights so it fit the carryon measurements and never got questioned at airports 

what went wrong

can really only think of three occasions 
 forgot my backpack in the luggage compartment of the bus when i got off and had to wait two days to get it back i barely made my flight to bangkok and probably aged a few years in these two days     
 motorbike accident in laos no real harm done just awful scratches and bruises that took some weeks to fully heal  be careful on dirtroads and always wear a helmet couldve been much worse     
 food poisoning in phnom phen not sure if it was ice cubes or the street food but i guess thats part of the experience

my favourite experiences

this is just a list of the most memorable moments for me every country has its own highlights     
 tour of mostar and the surrounding area by miran including his own expierience during the war    
 istanbul as a whole you could really feel the history    
 elephant sanctuary in thailand    
 driving around on motorbikes in sea and see the stunning nature especially laos and vietnam    
 dmz in seoul    
 riding the shinkansen trains in japan    
 taylor swift concert in las vegas not recommended for a backpacker on a budget    
 barrancas del cobre copper canyon mexico     
 spanish classes and staying with a host family at lago atitlan    
 acatenango hike    
 nature in costa rica    

would i do it again

absolutely a little different though i think for me the optimal trip length would be around four to five months if i am only traveling furthermore i would choose one countryregioncontinent to explore and plan even less in advance    
it was a awesome trip nonetheless and i am glad i had the chance to see all these different cultures

to conclude i just want to thank you and this sub in general it has been a great help and inspiration and i literally spent most of the time planning and researching on reddit    
i am happy to answer all your questiones"

  mandi and i signed a 2year lease in bangkok the sleep schedule since it might be a question later i usually work until 1am or 2am get to sleep within an hour and wake up 8 hoursish later anyways any travel after november is going to firmly be in touristvacation territory luckily this isnt rneverbrokeabone  i hope dont ban me i want to see a few dozen more posts about people deciding if they should stay in medelln or bangkok for their first place
  the wedding date is locked in and were getting married in spain next september
  speaking of spain we found out for certain that my dad does have spanish citizenship
  mandi had a medical emergency in seoul and im now dealing with sleep apneainduced gastroesophageal reflux disease nomading and working us hours from asia can take its toll also mandis insurance provider simply decided to stop doing telehealth  so shes going to move to her brothers address in washington to maintain a state wo income tax but  more importantly  to trigger a qualifying event which will allow her to change to a washington insurance provider that does support telehealth

  thailand bangkok  back home 

 no more nomad plans 

 how we decided where to live

the whole euro summer 2024 plans discussed in my last post got nixed because

1 its expensive in scotland and ireland and spain and now were trying to save for a wedding
2 we also found an amazing wedding planner who helped us choose a venue remotely so that definitely killed spain travel plans
3 the medical issues made us reassess our plan to nomad into 2024 i think both of us were just ready to settle down in an actual home we could call our own
4 cdmx because ive only ever heard positive things about the city in nomadsphere and among friends

 what has been the best part of dn life

in the previous post i said that there were 3 best things about dning living my daytoday with unique experiences my relationship being stronger than ever and working from amazing offices

1  last year i mentioned that my daytoday life is wildly varied and i liked that samesame really tough to get a routine going which has its pros and cons i think after living by the seat of my pants im excited for some monotony  this feels good though one extreme has made me appreciate the other
2  last year i said my relationship with mandi was stronger than ever only growth on this front now that were settling down shes getting into some hobbies and reconnecting with high school friends in bangkok and i love it
3  the last 2 years i mentioned that the potential places one can work while nomading are excellent this year id say that only pc bangs pc and my home office delivered  but kaikatsu club being my best option in japan was pretty frustrating internet in japan as a tourist was easily the worst logistical nightmare ive suffered in our journey more on that later

 gearapps we use

 a repeat entry over the years i swear im not sponsored italki is clutch japanese learning went very well by the end of the trip i was able to navigate restaurants bars clubs taxis and stores with ease i even made a friend in tokyo in my experience when speaking japanese to somebody they were very willing to stick with japanese regardless of how broken you sounded it really helped me improve quickly and im glad i did because there were many many times the ability to speak and understand helped i tried to learn korean in just a few weeks initially it was going well because its so similar to japanese however i gave up pretty quickly because i observed that seoul had the opposite phenomenon occurring when communicating with others even if their english was way worse than my korean theyd stay in english besides that a much larger percentage of people in seoul had great englishlanguage skills in my opinion enjoying japan in the cities i stayed in as a nomad would be difficult without learning some japanese but thats definitely not the case for seoul when we get back home mandi is going to take up thai and im going to review japanese in case we go for a ski trip this winter
 in the same vein i almost never use google translate anymore because i think chatgpt is simply so much better especially for japanese korean vietnamese and thai
 just like last year shout out to the tax professionals and accountants at both nomadtaxiohttpsnomadtaxio and zenaccountingcomhttpzenaccountingcom

 what has been the biggest challenge

  language barriers i was pleasantly surprised that we had no issues at all in italy or croatia i was surprised that even in ohrid and rural crete weve been able to communicate easily with only english knowing a bit of spanish helped me in athens and zagreb surprisingly  and mandi can always find the good thai restaurants by just speaking to people all that said i still think its one of the bigger challenges in dning because when there is an issue it sucks being unable to organically engage with people and be attached to google translate
  vs  the airbnb vs hotel fight isnt an absolute this remains true japan is a good example both the available hotels and airbnbs were awful i dont know whats up with japan and korea airbnb attempting to shove a mattress into every open corner of a house but it was wildly difficult to find 1 monthlong stays in places that had just like a queen mattress per bedroom in a 1 or 2bedroom place we literally couldnt in tokyo we ended up using hmlet in tokyo and absolutely loved the experience it was a bit more expensive but  as the japan trip continued  we realized it was worth every penny more on why later in osaka kyoto seoul and busan there were still a wild amount of barracks masquerading as airbnbs but there were enough decent options that we booked hotels were easily more expensive in seoul if i were younger or working better hours id probably have tried to stay at the hoppin house hosted by digitalnomadskoreacomhttpdigitalnomadskoreacom as it wouldve been wildly fun and affordable
  balancing longstays daytrips andor smaller excursions i feel like we conquered this 2023 challenge in 2024 the pacing was much nicer however i do think were about to ruin it 
  health issues while abroad mandi had a ruptured ovarian cyst while we were in seoul as if a womans body doesnt struggle with enough the doctor explained to us that women always get cysts on their ovaries whether or not they rupture is just a fun little lottery women are forced to participate in every time they ovulate the initial experience felt similar to what ive seen somebody else go through when their appendix burst where you think its a stomach pain and it just gets worse and worse until you realize you need to go to the hospital my american mind started looking up taxis to take us to the hospital but then i paused and googled tourist ambulance seoul and found out theyre free for everybody in all of korea america could never it took about 4 days for her to recover something good came out of the experience too as we had been planning an emergency trip to the us for mandi to pick up more meds as i mentioned earlier her health provider simply stopped offering telehealth and would not help us with switching to a different provider but the hospital refilled all of her prescription medications in the end the total cost was about 45m about 3200 at the time without insurance i was dreading the bill but it was not as bad as i thought it was going to be
  awful working hours while in east asia i arranged to do 24 shared us hours for my major client per night even that did little to help the horrible sleeping situation doing 8pm to 4am is not sustainable longterm in fact just that 5ish month stint has caused me some health issues once we got settled in bangkok i went to the hospital because i have been extremely phlegmy for months i was diagnosed with sleep apneainduced gerd now even though i have more hours to sleep with the gerd is making it a cyclical problem by making it hard for me to sleep take care of your body folks im hoping that returning to us time zone and sleeping more normal people hours will help

 what surprised us and what we wish we knew before

  nontourist sim with voice neigh impossible to attain in japan we thought india was difficult wew this simhttpswwwmobalcomjapansimcardtst from mobalcomhttpmobalcom is the only one weve seen that offers voice to tourists however we only found out about it while we were in japan if youre staying for a long time this is a mustbuy imo because so much of japan still runs on phone calls and emails more than half of our restaurant reservations we had to do in person or via a friend who could call the data is obviously low but you can pair this with a pocket wifi and be set for phone usage imo
  gigabit internet an epic journey to access as a tourist in japan getting highquality internet for work was extremely difficult in our experience the property we booked with hmlet was brand new and hadnt yet setup the internet infrastructure so we had to go with a trio mobile hotspots they provided for a few weeks theyd typically get 1020mbps if they stayed connected  we thought maybe they just gave us bad ones so we tried httpsrentalcdjapancojphttpsrentalcdjapancojp httpswwwjapanwirelesscomhttpswwwjapanwirelesscom and httpsninjawificomhttpsninjawificom all of them essentially behaved the same we eventually found a legitimately 5g 100300mbps download speed and good connection hotspot that was more expensive 200 a month  and it still had 15gb3 day limits with httpsglobaladvancedcommcomhttpsglobaladvancedcommcom multiple groups of friends and family visited us while in japan and they frequently got their own hotels and we asked them to assess their internet situations everybody encountered the same thing hotels provided wifi that would barely scrape 1020mbps all of this is totally fine for tourism but impossible for working collaboratively as a frontend web developer it also sucked that my only major recourse was to go to kaikatsu club at around 2hr for unlimited 2gbps internet its cute and fun but it was heinously nonergonomic because every room was either a tatami mat or a mat with a weird cushioned lawn chair when the internet was finally activated in our hmlet we measured the gigabit stable connection and it was like drinking water in a desert we hadnt booked our stays in kyoto or osaka until january and because of our experience we pressed hard in hosts dms trying to ascertain if the internet they would provide was going to be a legitimate hardwired routerprovided connection or if it would be hotspots in kyoto we got what we wanted however in osaka we kinda got duped i messaged about 15 hosts in the city and only one responded that they would have installed internet by the time of my stay when we arrived one pocket wifi with a 3gbday cap  when i pointed out the issue the host apologized profusely and paid for another one of the good pocket wifis but yeah its fuckin tough to get decent internet with longterm stays in japan also we were there december to february which is firmly low season i cant imagine how tough it is in the spring
  korean digital infrastructure is difficult to navigate on a tourist visa while japan is tough to enjoy because everything is still phone calls and emails korea is tough because everything is an app thats only used in korea frequently has no translations and often requires an arc number which you dont get as a tourist whatsapp no kakaotalk googleapple maps no navermaps also for food reviews and kakaomap a lot of these work without an arc number but you absolutely need a sim with a korean phone number to use almost all of these apps the first day we were there we went to five guys and was literally not allowed to enter the line because i had not yet gotten a phone number if you qualify and are staying for a month or more id definitely do the new nomad visahttpsdigitalnomadskoreacomposteverythingyouneedtoknowaboutkoreasdigitalnomadvisa so you can get an arc number it wasnt an option when we had planned our trip but our life was made easier thanks to a stateside friend who used to live in korea telling her friends to hang out with us hoppin house and the group that runs digital nomads korea also helped make things easier and more enjoyable by organizing events and giving us an avenue to use coupang
  ramen is built different in japan i ive heard the hype on the sushi and the food in general in japan and it all did taste amazing however the bit that surprised me the most was the ramen we had loads of ramen at nonfranchised places and noninternational chains but just to highlight the point ive eaten ramen at nonjapan locations for ippudo ichiran and jinya and all of their equivalents in japan blow them out of the water the flavor difference to me felt almost akin to a different dish

  korean bbq is life not much else to say here after leaving seoul i found myself wishing i had eaten at a noname red chair picnic table type bbq place after 6pm on a friday just once though as a passerby the vibes seemed immaculate

  nomad groups seem always worth a try we had such a lovely time hanging out with the folks at hoppin house who run the whatsapp group for digitalnomadskoreacomhttpdigitalnomadskoreacom the whatsapp group in turkey was also helpful for meeting people from both groups weve made some lifelong friends i kinda wish we had reached out in more places to hang out with more people but thats cuz im outgoing ymmv

busan,train to busan was much more emotional than i thought it would be especially for a zombie flick,"train to busan was much more emotional than i thought it would be especially for a zombie flick

the film revolves around a man and his daughter trying to travel during the outbreak of a zombie apocalypse at the beginning of the film theres visible tension between the father and daughter hes a workaholic who isnt around enough and theres a characterization that shows the father to be absent in his daughters life physically as well as emotionally 

throughout the film the father is played as very cold and unconcerned about nothing but his company all the while filling the normal fatherly role of looking after his daughter as the film goes on the characterization of the father is developed but by other people a man traveling with his pregnant wife for example sees him as a corporate selfish asshole whose only concern is himself and throughout the film you get the sense that he might be that way or so it seems

the film begins to show the father to not only be heroic and selfless but dedicated to his daughter at the end of the film when hes bitten after sacrificing his wellbeing to protect her he goes a final step further as he leaves his vulnerable daughter her screaming for him not to go he stands on the edge of a train cart knowing hes about to change for the worst you can see in his eyes that the transformation begins and his last final thoughtsare of his daughters birth that genuinely affected me emotionally 

that scene along with a strong score does something that no other film in the zombie genre has been able to do for me you feel something you feel his pain as he cries thinking of his newborn daughter cradled between his arms in the delivery room knowing hes about to leave her life forever his eyes visibly clouding from the infection thats about to turn him while smiling and laughing at his last human thoughts of her he leaps off the train before the transformation is complete 

this scene was fantastic and made the film in my opinion it subverted my expectations and i honestly didnt think i could be affected that way by a film in this genre 

i wonder has there ever been a film that surprised you emotionally

daegu,best way to travel from incheon airport to daegu ,"best way to travel from incheon airport to daegu

just a quick travel tuesday question that i think could be supplemented by some personal experiences if anyone has them

i used to live in korea but its been about 6 years since then my fatherinlaw is wanting to take a trip back to say goodbye to his mother my inlaws havent lived in korea for 30 years and are technology illiterate so they dont know how to get around anymore 

they want to take a plane from incheon to daegu after arriving but i used to take the ktx train all the time and remember it being much cheaper and only about an hour and a half travel time a plane may seem easier but depending on layovers boarding time flight time and deboarding it can be 4 extra hours of travel

the only problem is that it appears that route might be partially under construction does anyone have insights i know we could take a taxi and go to seoul station and ktx from there but my mother in law is very frail and cannot walk long distances like she would need to for seoul station im just looking for a good compromise between ease of travel and cost if train or charter bus really isnt an option anymore like i remember i just want to hear it from those currently living there"

japans cabinet oks bill to give prime minister ability to declare emergency amid virus outbreakhttpswwwjapantimescojpnews20200310nationalpoliticsdiplomacycabinetbillshinzoabestateofemergencycoronavirusxmez6qhkiul this is not a state of emergency please read the link above or our summary below

the cabinet on tuesday approved a bill that would enable prime minister shinzo abe to declare a state of emergency if needed as japan scrambles to stop the spread of the new coronavirus abe who faced criticism for being too relaxed in his initial response to the outbreak has sought the power to prepare for a worst case scenario

moreover the prime minister has extended a government request to event organizers nationwide to refrain from holding such gatherings by about 10 days the request was initially until march 19

the legal change would allow the prime minister to declare a state of emergency lasting up to two years if coronavirus infections spread rapidly across the country and fears are raised of a grave impact on peoples lives and the economy

once an emergency is declared prefectural governors can instruct residents to stay indoors and ask for schools to close and events to be canceled

local governments can also demand that essential supplies such as medicine and food be sold to them they can temporarily take over private land and facilities to provide medical care

abe has already requested that schools across the nation close and big sports and cultural events be canceled or postponed but under the current law the government does not have the legal power to enforce school closures or event cancellations

the main opposition constitutional democratic party of japan and the democratic party for the people say the prime minister should seek prior parliamentary approval before any declaration of a state of emergency

once again this bill does not enact a state of emergency for the country it merely means to reflect and strengthen the laws put in place from previous viral outbreaks in japan

also of note is the recommendation by a panel of experts to continue closures for another 10 days beyond what has already been notedhttpsenglishkyodonewsnetnews20200329c7cf7a3604urgentabeextendsrequestforeventcancellationsamidvirusspreadhtml in the comments we will be updating the closures thread as necessary as companies extend the break

border control increase begins today in japan nhk has an article on the general guidelines for border control at this timehttpswww3nhkorjpnhkworldennews2020030901  

we have reprinted the article in full below  

japan increased border control measures on monday in an effort to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus

the government is asking people arriving from china and south korea including japanese nationals to stay at home or other private accommodation for two weeks at their own expense

officials are asking those travelers to refrain from using public transportation including planes trains buses and taxis and use private or rental cars from the airport of their entry to their homes or accommodation facilities

visitors are asked to declare to quarantine officials where they will stay during the first two weeks as well as their means of transportation from the airport they will be asked to remain at the airport until arrangements are ready

during the twoweek period they will be asked to check their health daily if they develop a fever and other symptoms they are asked to call a consultation center and visit a designated hospital

the measures are expected to remain in effect until the end of this month they are not legallybinding but the health ministry is asking for cooperation

once again we would advise if you have a stopover in any of the affected countries china korea hong kong macau  named specifically that you contact your airline to change your flight as soon as possible these measures will be in force until the end of this month at the very least

tourism update 0306

japanese prime minister shinzo abe we will ask people entering japan from the two countries to stay at places designated by the quarantine chief for two weeks and not to use public transportation systems in the countryhttpswww3nhkorjpnhkworldennews2020030602

a more in depth explanation of the restrictions is explained herehttpswwwjapantimescojpnews20200305nationaljapanquarantinearrivalschinasouthkoreaxmhjsyhkiuk we have reprinted the article below

japan will request that people arriving from south korea and china be quarantined for two weeks at designated facilities in japan to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus prime minister shinzo abe said thursday

we will strengthen immigration quarantines on people from the two countries abe told a cabinetlevel task force meeting on the virus

we will ask them to stay in designated areas for two weeks and not to use public transport in the country

the measure will take effect at 1200 am on march 9 and last through march 31 he said

the government is calling for tourists from china where the virus emerged and south korea which has been hard hit by the outbreak to put off travel to japan and will cancel visas for travelers from the two countries abe said

in order to reduce the amount of inbound travel from china and south korea we will limit arrival destinations for aircraft from the two countries to narita and kansai airports he said

the visa suspensions will effectively ban all chinese nationals from entering japan

we will suspend transport of passengers by ship and cancel temporary and multipleentry visas that have already been issued abe said

flights from china and south korea will be able to land only in narita airport near tokyo and osakas kansai airport he said abe also said that bans on entering japan will be expanded to foreign nationals who have been in any part of south korea or iran

this appears to be seperate from a bigger bill aimed at reducing the number of overall tourists at this moment to halt the spread of the virus the nhk has posted an article on the other measures of the billhttpswww3nhkorjpnhkworldennews2020030550 and how it will allow the government to enact a state of emergency  giving them the power to control some businesses operating hours close schools and instruct people to stay indoors authorities would also be able to use buildings and land without their owners consent for medical purposes  

in short if you are a korean or chinese national you will not be allowed to enter the country without facing a 14 day quarantine any planes arriving from either location will only be processed at either narita or kansai airport starting march 9th and lasting until march 31st it will also include visitors from hong kong and macau as well as japanese nationals coming from these countries  we are assuming this includes those returning from vacation in those areas entry visas are being cancelled for china korea hong kong macau and iran which sounds like it means you will be quarantined at the border and could be sent home after the 14 days are up

if you have a flight with a stopover in either country you would be wise to contact your airline right away and arrange to either fly direct or reroute through a different area to avoid getting caught up in the quarantine we have no confirmation that stopovers are excluded or included in this requirement but its better to be safe than sorry

the japanese government has rolled out requirements to help curb the spread of the virus as the next two weeks are crucial for transmission within the countryhttpswwwjapantimescojpnews20200225nationalsciencehealthjapanguidelinescovid19coronavirusxlakgchkiuk presumably this is why we are currently seeing an increase in closures and cancellations by locations that would normally draw crowds of tourists and locals such as museums and sports events 

the government is asking people to take even more care when in public with frequent handwashing and sanitizing and wearing a mask if you plan to be out in large crowds for long periods of time as tourists you should consistently perform with the utmost caution to follow these rules to help prevent yourself from catching the virus the nhk has provided a very helpful articlehttpswww3nhkorjpnhkworldennewsbackstories877 with video that explains how to wash your hands properly and thoroughly to help break down the chain of bacteria and viruses and how to wear a mask properly to help stop the spread of infection  

wed like to remind you that while these measures are effective when applied consistently they will not necessarily prevent you from catching the virus in the aforementioned large crowds that the health ministry is asking people to avoid this information is intended as a guideline to help prevent transmission but certain risk groups should see this as a warning that the government is expecting things to get worse before they get better and they should closely look at the options for travel as the best method for not catching covid19 in japan is to not go at this time

general information  

what is covid19 how does it affect me  

 
the faq from the cdc on covid19 is herehttpswwwcdcgovcoronavirus2019ncovfaqhtml  
 
the symptoms more frequently noted include the followinghttpswwwcdcgovcoronavirus2019ncovaboutsymptomshtml  

 high fever  

 shortness of breath this is an absolute call to health authorities if you or anyone in your travel group experiences this symptom you should be notifying staff of your hotelhostel right away for medical assistance  

 coughing with or without phlegm if you begin to cough and feel very congested in the chest quickly do not delay in notifying health authorities pneumonia is one of the reasons why this flu is deadly in certain people and the cdc has already recorded an instance in china where a healthy 36 year old victim died from pneumonia brought on by the virus there is currently no treatment for this virus aside from supportive care to relieve symptoms any cases diagnosed with pneumonia are generally hospitalized  

the recommendations for curbing the spread of covid19 is detailed on this page httpswwwcdcgovcoronavirus2019ncovaboutpreventiontreatmenthtml   

major risks with this virus are

 transmission from person to person has been noted in japan  

 it can take up to 14 days before you show any symptoms meaning that your body is shedding the virus in bodily fluids such as exhalation commonly called aerosol mucus from the nose and mouth and fecal matter  

 carriers of the virus can be asymptomatic not showing any symptoms like sneezingcoughing while they are transmitting the virus to others  

the crux of curbing any virus is to wash your hands or use sanitizer on a frequent basis when touching items in public also   

  do not touch your eyes nose or mouth with hands that have not been washed or sanitized  

  cover any coughs or sneezes with your arm andor a tissue throw the tissue away and wash your hands afterwards  

  if you are opening doors and wish to avoid picking up anything from door handles use your elbow or foot to push the door open if possible

canadian government has just specified that they will not repatriate canadians stranded abroad  there will be no rescue planes sent to collect canadians who have flights cancelled on them and cannot rebook to reenter the country

we are beginning to see reports from users who are having return flights from japan cancelled by various airlines

if this happens you have the following options

contact your travel insurance agency to request guidance rebooking your flight may be covered by them

contact another airline to book a new flight out as soon as possible  note that this will come in at a higher cost than you initially paid

prepare to stay in japan longer than expected which may involve having to book different hotels or hostels depending on longer term costs

there is an assistance program being set up to help stranded canadians overseas more information will be available through the governments website in the coming days

if youre abroad at this time its time for you to come home  prime minister justin trudeau

again we do recommend rescheduling or cancelling trips to japan at this time as each individual country makes decisions on how best to curb the spread of the virus this is not going to get better any time soon and any country that has yet to place travel restrictions worldwide will just be heading in that direction in the coming days

japans cabinet oks bill to give prime minister ability to declare emergency amid virus outbreakhttpswwwjapantimescojpnews20200310nationalpoliticsdiplomacycabinetbillshinzoabestateofemergencycoronavirusxmez6qhkiul this is not a state of emergency please read the link above or our summary below

the cabinet on tuesday approved a bill that would enable prime minister shinzo abe to declare a state of emergency if needed as japan scrambles to stop the spread of the new coronavirus abe who faced criticism for being too relaxed in his initial response to the outbreak has sought the power to prepare for a worst case scenario

moreover the prime minister has extended a government request to event organizers nationwide to refrain from holding such gatherings by about 10 days the request was initially until march 19

the legal change would allow the prime minister to declare a state of emergency lasting up to two years if coronavirus infections spread rapidly across the country and fears are raised of a grave impact on peoples lives and the economy

once an emergency is declared prefectural governors can instruct residents to stay indoors and ask for schools to close and events to be canceled

local governments can also demand that essential supplies such as medicine and food be sold to them they can temporarily take over private land and facilities to provide medical care

abe has already requested that schools across the nation close and big sports and cultural events be canceled or postponed but under the current law the government does not have the legal power to enforce school closures or event cancellations

the main opposition constitutional democratic party of japan and the democratic party for the people say the prime minister should seek prior parliamentary approval before any declaration of a state of emergency

once again this bill does not enact a state of emergency for the country it merely means to reflect and strengthen the laws put in place from previous viral outbreaks in japan

also of note is the recommendation by a panel of experts to continue closures for another 10 days beyond what has already been notedhttpsenglishkyodonewsnetnews20200329c7cf7a3604urgentabeextendsrequestforeventcancellationsamidvirusspreadhtml in the comments we will be updating the closures thread as necessary as companies extend the break

tourism update 0308

border control increase begins today in japan nhk has an article on the general guidelines for border control at this timehttpswww3nhkorjpnhkworldennews2020030901  

we have reprinted the article in full below  

japan increased border control measures on monday in an effort to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus

the government is asking people arriving from china and south korea including japanese nationals to stay at home or other private accommodation for two weeks at their own expense

officials are asking those travelers to refrain from using public transportation including planes trains buses and taxis and use private or rental cars from the airport of their entry to their homes or accommodation facilities

visitors are asked to declare to quarantine officials where they will stay during the first two weeks as well as their means of transportation from the airport they will be asked to remain at the airport until arrangements are ready

during the twoweek period they will be asked to check their health daily if they develop a fever and other symptoms they are asked to call a consultation center and visit a designated hospital

the measures are expected to remain in effect until the end of this month they are not legallybinding but the health ministry is asking for cooperation

once again we would advise if you have a stopover in any of the affected countries china korea hong kong macau  named specifically that you contact your airline to change your flight as soon as possible these measures will be in force until the end of this month at the very least

tourism update 0306

japanese prime minister shinzo abe we will ask people entering japan from the two countries to stay at places designated by the quarantine chief for two weeks and not to use public transportation systems in the countryhttpswww3nhkorjpnhkworldennews2020030602

a more in depth explanation of the restrictions is explained herehttpswwwjapantimescojpnews20200305nationaljapanquarantinearrivalschinasouthkoreaxmhjsyhkiuk 

this appears to be seperate from a bigger bill aimed at reducing the number of overall tourists at this moment to halt the spread of the virus the nhk has posted an article on the other measures of the billhttpswww3nhkorjpnhkworldennews2020030550 and how it will allow the government to enact a state of emergency  giving them the power to control some businesses operating hours close schools and instruct people to stay indoors authorities would also be able to use buildings and land without their owners consent for medical purposes  

in short if you are a korean or chinese national you will not be allowed to enter the country without facing a 14 day quarantine any planes arriving from either location will only be processed at either narita or kansai airport starting march 9th and lasting until march 31st it will also include visitors from hong kong and macau as well as japanese nationals coming from these countries  we are assuming this includes those returning from vacation in those areas entry visas are being cancelled for china korea hong kong macau and iran which sounds like it means you will be quarantined at the border and could be sent home after the 14 days are up

if you have a flight with a stopover in either country you would be wise to contact your airline right away and arrange to either fly direct or reroute through a different area to avoid getting caught up in the quarantine we have no confirmation that stopovers are excluded or included in this requirement but its better to be safe than sorry

what is coronavirus

coronaviruses cov are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as middle east respiratory syndrome merscov and severe acute respiratory syndrome sarscov a novel coronavirus ncov is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans 

the current outbreak has been identified by the world health organization as covid19httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovelcoronavirus2019 a new strain first identified in humans in late 2019 initially in hubei province in china as of february 24th there have been an estimated 80000 confirmed cases of covid19 reported worldwide with just over 2600 deaths this map from johns hopkinshttpsgisanddatamapsarcgiscomappsopsdashboardindexhtmlbda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6 tracks confirmed cases in realtime

the who declared a global health emergencyhttpswwwbbccomnewsworld51318246 on january 30th 2020 in attempt to stop the spread of this virus

should i cancelpostpone my travel plans

the decision to travel is up to you you should always check and follow the latest health guidelines from your government authorities and from medical professionals travel forums andor random strangers on the internet are not reliable sources of health information the decision on whether to travel is always up to you

but here is some relevant information current as of feb 24 2020

 travel to hubei province  wuhan is under level 4 advisory by most world governments and is heavily restricted by the chinese government if you have plans to visit hubei province you should probably cancel or postpone
 travel to mainland china is under level 3 avoid nonessential travel or level 4 avoid all travel advisory by most western governments many airlines have cancelled flights and are issuing cancellation or rebooking waivers if you have plans to travel tothrough mainland china in the near future you will probably want to postponecancel your travel plans
 travel to south korea  update feb 27th  the cdc has issued a level 3 avoid nonessential travel warning for south korea the us and new zealand are among governments who have upgraded their travel warnings to level 3 for south korea as a whole other governments including canada and australia are still maintaining a level 2 warning exercise a high degree of caution the uk is advising against nonessential travel to daegu or cheongdo only
 travel to other parts of eastsoutheast asia is not currently under advisory however countries reporting significant cases of coronavirus include japan singapore hong kong taiwan and thailand among others in some or all of these countries there may be restrictions on transportation cancellation of public gatherings and other attempts to stem the spread of the virus 
 travel to italy  on march 7 the italian government announced widespread lockdown measures in northern italyhttpswwwbbccomnewsworldmiddleeast51787238 to affect 16 million people affected regions and cities include lombardy milan and venice no travel in or out except for preapproved reasons will be permitted until april 3 if you have travel plans to italy you should contact your airline or travel company to arrange alternate plans
 travel to iran is discouraged by a level 3 or level 4 advisory by most western governments some of this was due to preexisting political tensions before coronavirus but iran is also experiencing some of the worst numbers of cases of the virus outside of china
 travel to other countries  the decision to travel is yours but be aware that cases are increasing in countries around the world carefully consider your travel plans not just for the risk of getting the coronavirus but also due to the possibility of lockdown or quarantine measures being imposed travel bans by your home or onward country affecting your plans or the possibility that your travels might put others in your life especially elderly people or those with compromised immune systems at risk
note that the situation is rapidly changing well do our best to keep this thread updated but you should monitor the latest updates for your destination before you travel

what about flights connecting through china or other affected regions

if your destination is not china but you have travel plans that were scheduled to connect via china most airlines may be able to rebook you on an alternate routing via a different connection either on their own flights or via an airline partner it helps when contacting your airline to have researched several alternate routings that might work for your date so you can propose them to the agent if your airline cancels your flight and does not offer any rebooking options check with your travel insurance company as you might be able to obtain some compensation

what steps can i take to protect myself during my travels

the who recommends standard commonsense protection measures such as maintaining basic hand and respiratory hygiene and safe food practices and avoiding close contact when possible with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing unless you are in direct contact with an infected person your risk level is likely low 

are there any restrictions on entering or travelling through countries

a number of countries including the united states australia new zealand japan and israel have imposed restrictions or bans on travellers from affected regions including mainland china south korea iran and italy andor who have visited those regions in the past 14 days you can find a detailed updated list of these restrictions herehttpswwwthinkglobalhealthorgarticletravelrestrictionschinaduecovid19

im booked to go on a cruise should i worry

if you plan to travel on a cruise you may be following the news of several high profile quarantines of cruise ships notably the diamond princess which remains quarantined off the coast of japan resulting in hundreds of passengers falling ill and thus far three confirmed deaths of passengers a number of cruise lines have announced preventative measures including increased disinfection standards restrictions on boarding for passengers from affected regions and more check with your cruise line for the latest updates before you travel 

im of asian backgroundethnicity and am concerned about racism during my travels should i worry

its been an unfortunate side effect of the coronavirus that many people including travellers of asian background or ethnicity have reported a spike in racist or xenophobic attacks either because people fear anyone who looks like they may be from china or simply because racists are using this outbreak as a license for their hate speech there is never any good excuse for racism and coronavirus surely is not one having said that reports by travellers of asian background have varied wildly including firsthand accounts on this subreddit if this affects you and you would like to discuss your experiences or have concerns about travelling to particular areas please share them in the thread below 

what about travel insurance

if you had travel plans booked to an affected region prior to the outbreak of coronavirus and now wish to postpone or cancel your trip you may be wondering if your travel insurance will cover you thishttpswwwcanadianunderwritercaclaimsinsandoutsoftravelinsuranceamidcoronavirusoutbreak1004173736 is a good primer written for canadians but with general advice that applies to people from many countries the nutshell version is if you had travel plans to china and made your bookings prior to the issuance of travel advisories from your country your insurance policy will likely cover you in the event of cancellation or rebooking for any outofpocket charges that you cant get back from your airline or travel providers if you booked after the travel advisories were issued you probably arent covered

if i travel to an affected area what about my job

many companies are imposing restrictions on employees who have travelled to affected areas requiring them to selfquarantine work from home or take time off prior to returning to work if you have travel plans and are concerned speak to your companys hr department

what other resources can i consult

daegu,when we travel from somewhere south of seoul like daegu to seoul we say  when we travel from somewhere north of seoul like pocheon we say  what would we say if we were traveling from somewhere east of seoul like gangneung to seoul,exactly what title says
daegu,any travels hacks for south korea 720  810 from ny or pa to anywhere in south korea preferably near daegu but i would go with a cheaper flight,NO BODY
daegu,210628 wjsn instagram update  eunseo and dayoung for nqqs self travel in daegu,NO BODY
daegu,i am a singaporean living in korea ama,"hi in light of the recent vtl i figured there might be many considering trips to korea but might be hesitant because theyre not sure about how the situation is in seoul rn or how the tourist scene has evolved

i moved to korea last year at the very beginning of the pandemic when the first few cases hit daegu i havent been back to sg since lol got vaxxed here too but anyway i hope to give some insight to those who are on the fence

1 how are social distancing guidelines in korea right now

seoul and the greater metropolitan area gyeonggi province is level 4 other cities busan jeonju jeju are level 3 assuming everyone in your group is fully vaccinated you can have up to 8 people or 10 for level 3 as of oct 15 level 4 also means that all establishments have to close at 10pm but restaurants can continue to do takeawaydelivery mask mandate continues

2 are the tourist spots still open

myeongdong has been very badly hit dont bother the shopping streets in ewha and dongdaemun areas that had tourists as their main customer base are pretty quiet but life in other areas is basically quite normal and business is as per usual id say dont worry too much about that  just look for spots that locals go to as for attractions theme parks etc still open just running at less capacity i saw pictures of everland being super full last week 

3 i wanna travel to jejua different city instead of seoul how do i make that happen with vtl

you have to isolate for a day until your negative test results come back technically if you can make private transport arrangements you can go to whatever city you want after you land and isolate there but of course its going to be challenging going straight to busan or jeju practically impossible with private transport from incheon airport so you should stay a day in seoulsomewhere nearer to incheon first until the next morning then youre free to go

4 how does contact tracing happen if i visit a cluster

if its a big cluster there will be a public health alert  disaster message thing sent to all phones in the administrative area of that particular establishment to advise you to get tested free and if you visited at the same time you should also be contacted by the local health center to get a mandatory test free theyll get your contact number because before you enter any restaurants  shopping mall etc youll have to sign in like how sg does tt i suppose for locals we use kakaotalk or naver to generate a qr code tied to our local identity but i believe shortterm visitors wont be able to do this because you dont have a resident number so every place will usually have a book for you to manually sign in  if you cant provide a prepaid number i think you can give your kakao id cause ive seen some exchange students do that also discussions are ongoing on how to get tt qr codes to be verified with the korean system i believe vice versa for koreans visiting sg or people like me returning home 

5 what happens if i catch covid here touchwood

youll be send to a living facility until your symptoms subside the cost should be borne by you but thats what insurance is for so please get the appropriate policy

6 why are you in korea and how long have you been there will you stay here long term 

going into my 3rd year soon im doing uni here and i chose to study here because my department is not offered in singapore if i say what it is i might self dox so if you really wanna know pm but its something very specific to korea my plan after grad is to either continue with my masters here or work for 3 years or so then balik kampong 

7 is life stressful here 

yes

8 is everyone a kpop star or a walking plastic surgery advertisement do you see gong yoo at the train station

no

9 can you speak fluent korean or is it easy to get by without learning the language here
my topik score is a low level 6 so i would say yes fluent to a certain extent and i take a good portion of uni classes in korean but you can definitely surive without knowing much korean here if in a big city and actually even in the countryside can also la just use papago naver translate



ok thats about all i can think of for now i would say if you dont mind forking out the test fees and you want a more relaxing holiday go for it obviously things arent completely the same as precovid no more overnight shopping midnight karaoke or midnight street food  at least for level 4 but this is the new normal after all and you can still have fun

edit formatting also added some reoccurring questions to the post for those who are considering a move and want some indepth answers on life here especially potential uni students please feel free to ask or dm surprisingly there are not as many singaporeans studying here as there are in say ukus or even the neighbouring japan i would say for undergrad students theres less than 100 of us and the rest are working so i do understand information from a singaporean can be quite hard to find 

edit 2 wow didnt expect this to blow up so much i guess singaporeans are indeed very curious about travelling and life in korea thanks for entertaining me today it was fun respite from my midterm studying those who pmed me ill get to them too hope to see many of yall on the streets of seoul soon "

daegu,south korean government used bts in tourism package without permission ,"
the south korean government used fanmade murals near the school streets of two bts members suga and v from daegu to promote their own tourism package which cost 13 million won person this package was advertised by the government website and press release issued by them the tour is organized by government backed travel agency

the ministry of culture sports and tourism even made and distributed a press release informing the contents of tourism products and the korea visit committee under the ministry of culture sports and tourism also posted information on the tourist destination and schedule on the website

hybe has released a statement that they had no idea about this business this investigation was made by sbs and when they reached out to the government about this the bts package inclusion was deleted 

interestingly  ministry of culture sports and tourism was responsible to make a committee and decide on the bts military exemption they only gave temporary exemption postponement bts is estimated to have generated economic effects worth 4186 trillion won 326 billion over the past decade according to data from hyundai research institute bts is also attracting around 800000 foreign tourists to korea each year despite the huge economic and cultural impact the government and its ministry failed to give any decision while keeping the bts member in the dark for years there were even proposals of allowing bts to enlist while being able to tour in exchange of performances that would promote the military and government propaganda in the end the members revoked their exemption and started their enlistment 


"
daegu,if mike trout played the rest of his career in korea  an ootp experiment,"in one of the most interesting moves of this offseason the brewers signed 30 year old first baseman eric thames to a 3 year 16 million dollar contract thames hadnt played in the majors since 2012 and he was rather unremarkable when he did in 181 games over two seasons with toronto and seattle thames posted a 01 war and struck out in over 25 of his at bats so why is thames suddenly signing with a major league team especially for this kind of money the answer is because he spent the last three seasons in korea and he absolutely mashed thames had a 1171 ops and hit 124 home runs in his 2015 mvp season thames put up an absurd line of 
381497790 with 47 homers he also stole 40 bases and was only caught 8 times and the move has paid off for first place milwaukee as thames has an impressive wrc of 137 however he has fallen down to earth it seems as that number was 107 in may and a dreadful 67 in june

eric thames is obviously a better hitter than he was five years ago but outside of the first month he has been a far cry from his korea self clearly playing abroad against weaker competition has inflated thames numbers as it has for several mediocre major leaguers such as wladimir balentien who in 2013 became japans single season home run king seeing the success of thames led me to ask an interesting question if playing in korea can turn someone like eric thames into a hitting god what can it do for the best player in the majors mike trout i decided to test this idea out

i used ootp a highly realistic baseball simulation game to get the answers i wanted i placed mike trout on koreas kt wiz the team playing in the biggest hitters park in the league to ensure trout didnt get homesick before i was through with him i deleted the mlb and all its players and prospects the only baseball league in the world is the korean baseball organization and its superstar is mike trout at only age 24 going into the first season can the millville meteor become the greatest baseball player south korea has ever seen over the rest of his career


see how happy he lookshttpiimgurcomg49hyy5png

2016	war  105

there was no transition period for trout as he quickly established himself as the best player in the league winning the triple crown and mvp trout hit 324 with 31 home runs in the 144 game season his on base percentage was an absurd 507 thanks to 152 walks and 155 hits his 105 war was nearly twice as high as the second best hitter trout led the league in just about every offensive category except for total bases which was led by none other than eric thames unfortunately trouts wiz lost in the korean series to the daegu samsung lions his 370 batting average couldnt prevent the lions from winning in 7 games though the loss was disappointing trouts career was only just beginning

2017 war  122

trout had an even better season than his first hitting 346 with 43 home runs and 122 war he couldnt win back to back triple crowns as he was beaten out in rbis by rockies legend wilin rosario trout was the uncontested mvp but his wiz unfortunately missed the playoffs mike trout can travel halfway across the world dominate much inferior competition and he still cant play for a winning team

2018 war  143

after three years and three mvps mike trouts numbers are starting to approach insanity his second triple crown in three years he slashed 372472759 with 53 home runs and 143 war he also had a remarkable 40 game hitting streak beginning in august that stretched into september nc dinos player sungbum na is the only player who even approaches trouts numbers with 39 homers and 101 war na gets the last laugh though as his team downs trouts in 7 games in the korean series the dinos scored 4 runs in the bottom of the 8th to win the deciding game 108 and rip trouts heart out once again as a consolation trout won series mvp with a 439 average and 5 home runs in the losing effort

2019 war  137

in his age 27 season trout reached another level on offense but suffered his first injury trout missed the final two weeks of the regular season and the entire playoffs with a fractured thumb however he hit a ridiculous 401 with 44 home runs in 127 games to win his third triple crown and fourth mvp he slashed 401531803 for an ops of 1334 a number that would be 6th in mlb history bested by only three bonds and two ruth seasons oh and with trout on the disabled list his kt wiz won the korean series in five games with only one season before free agency this upcoming year is a big one for our hero

2020 war  66

a testament to his abilities trout played in only 73 of his teams 144 games due to three different injuries and he still managed to lead the league in war without coming close to qualifying for the batting title his team struggled without him and finished 8th out of 10 teams in the league the writers still voted him mvp and sungbum na was forced to settle for second for the 4th year in a row
in the ultimate kevin durant move trout signed a 6 year 87 million dollar contract with his rival nas nc dinos trout joins the team that has won three of the past four championships with the second and third best hitters in the league na and our old friend eric thames

2021 war  101

trout puts up the lowest war in a full season of his career largely due to the fact that he is inexplicably playing designated hitter he won his fourth triple crown and sixth consecutive mvp on the back of a 350468718 slash line and 50 home runs the dinos unsurprisingly swept the korean series with trout being named mvp he turned 30 during this season and to this point he has hit 357 averaging 140 wins above replacement per 162 games hes pretty good

2022 war  112

trout has one of his best offensive seasons yet slashing 362504763 with 48 home runs winning his 7th mvp and 5th triple crown his war took a hit from the lack of playing a position in the field but his 1267 ops is his second best he set a career high in extra base hits with 97 for the second year in a row trout finishes with 666 plate appearances further solidifying my theory that he sold his soul to the devil in exchange for his baseball talents unfortunately his dinos were upset in the semifinals by the gwangju kia tigers named after the car company the dinos obviously felt the loss of first baseman eric thames who signed as a free agent with mike trouts former team the wiz trouts teammate sungbum na put up another 75 win season finishing  second in mvp voting for the 6th consecutive year

2023 war  117

trouts career war now sits above 90 after only 8 seasons it is now a given that he will win the triple crown as he does so for the sixth time in eight mvp seasons he also leads the league for the first time with 50 doubles crushing his previous career high of 39 set last year his dinos finish 10044 cruising to their 5th title in the past 7 years teammate sungbum na finishes second in mvp voting for the seventh straight season and at age 34 2 years older than trout his chances at an award may be few eric thames has retired leaving behind a whopping 156 wrc a top 20 all time number in the mlb trouts 217 meaning he is 217 as good as the average hitter is by far the best of all time

2024 war  136

trout returned to playing center field full time and posted his highest war in five seasons despite missing a week with a hand injury he slashed 376498736 to win his 9th mvp but he could not win the triple crown his team sweeps through the playoffs and trout has another ring to add to his collection he is a career 360 hitter with 384 home runs and 104 war in only 85 seasons and showing no signs of slowing down

2025 war  117

even though he has proven to be more than capable in the outfield trouts manager decided to move him back to dh for the 2025 season for some reason he had the type of season thats begun to be expected of him with a 1225 ops and a career high 54 home runs including his 400th trout becomes a free agent following the upcoming season he has won the championship in four of his five seasons with the dinos but the 10time defending mvp may choose to chase a large contract elsewhere

2026 war  113

back in centerfield the 35 year old trout may be beginning to show signs of slowing down though he hit 351 and won his 8th triple crown trouts 1110 ops was his lowest since his first season in korea he also won his 4th straight and 6th overall korean series as the lotte giants blew a 31 lead and the dinos won game 7 on a walk off double by minkook kang who hit a whopping 212 in the regular season
in the offseason trout signed a 3 year 35 million contract with the seoul lg twins a team sponsored by one of the countrys largest electronics manufacturers

2027 war  102

despite missing nearly 40 games with an array of injuries trout had another phenomenal season putting up a slash line of 359502698 and over 10 war in a season in which he barely played 100 games he had his 2000th career hit in june and his 500th career home run in july

2028 war  144

when many thought his career was entering its twilight trout put up the best season he has ever had hitting 396 with 54 home runs trout at ages 36 and 37 had a higher war than in any season thus far in the modern era only 5 men have had a higher obp in a single season than trouts career value of 492 trout won his 13th mvp 9th triple crown and 7th ring as his twins won in 7 games in other words he is the greatest baseball player this world has ever seen

2029 war  36

it was a lost year for trout ravaged by several injuries he hit below 300 for the first time in his career for the first time ever he failed to win mvp the award instead went to minsu lee who led the league with 51 home runs at age 38 and entering free agency trouts days may be numbered
in the offseason trout chose to remain with the twins on a two year deal

2030 war  21

trouts downfall was as quick as his rise missing 30 games due to injury he had the worst war of his career largely due to his diminished skills in the field though he still had an obp of 430 trout was all around the worst he has ever been failing to win mvp for the second season in a row rival and former teammate sungbum na retired following the season na finished second behind trout in mvp voting 7 seasons in a row from 2017 to 2023

2031 war  41

now 40 trout is a shadow of the player he formerly was he still led the league in obp as he has done in every season in which he has qualified but he hit only 260 he hit his 600th career home run in late july but he failed to hit another over the rest of the season still valuable but no longer elite mike trout hopes to play a few more seasons in the korean baseball organization as long as his body holds up

2032 war  67

defying the odds trout continues to be a solid contributor past the age of 40 it shouldnt be too surprising since many former major leaguers such as julio franco and manny ramirez have come to asia and found success playing against weaker competition in the offseason trout signed a 1 year deal with his former team the nc dinos who won 5 championships in trouts six seasons with them in 2032 trout proved he could still hit leading the league with a 448 obp and winning his 13th korean silver slugger his dinos were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs but trout has proven he is not done yet

2033 war  25

41 years old on opening day mike trout signed a 2 year deal with the defending champion nexen heroes he had the worst season of his career batting 225 with 8 home runs and 163 strikeouts he continues to get on base in his old age reaching at a 415 clip this is the first season in trouts career in which he does not lead the league in that category he finishes second behind minsu lee whose batting average was 110 points higher though he struggles trout remains a positive contributor and he plans to suit up for at least one more season

2034 war  39

trout had a bit of a bounce back season at the plate leading the majors with a 432 on base percentage despite his 131 wrc in nearly a full season trout drove in only 31 runs for the 4th place heroes due to the fact that he only had 23 extra base hits a 43 year old free agent and on base machine trout hopes to be able to sign another major league contract meanwhile sungbum na was inducted into the hall of fame with 95 of the votes and zero mvps

2035 war  09

it took 20 seasons but mike trout is officially washed up after signing a deal with the doosan bears trout produced a war below 1 and a pathetic 613 ops slugging an impressively bad 262 he led the league in walks once again with 97 but he also led in strikeouts with 193 which translates to a mark reynoldsesque 217 in a 162 game season in an otherwise awful season there was celebration as trout recorded his 3000th career hit in september his personality characteristic is listed as never satisfied with his performance and in that vein the millville meteor returns for a 21st season in korea

2036 war  17

trout returned to the nc dinos for a third stint with the team with which he won 5 rings he improved slightly at the plate posting an obp of 361 and a league leading 108 walks his 11 home runs were his highest in 4 years however he batted 207 and slugged 303 lowering his career average to 322 against all odds koreas goat decides to push off retirement another year and return for another season

2037 war  11

trout limped to the finish line as a member of the kia tigers with a career low 183 batting average the only reason he was above replacement level was because of his league leading 118 walks trouts slugging percentage was 255 which is incomprehensibly bad especially for a 13 time mvp 46 years old and with his best years a decade behind him mike trout retires from korean professional baseball

so what did we learn from this exercise we learned that mike trout would be pretty good if he played in korea the best ever in fact he won 7 rings and 13 mvps and played well into his 40s
here are some of his career numbers

seasons 22 19 full

hits 3191

walks 2472 led the league every season

batting average 316 career high 401

obp 458 career high 533

home runs 651 career high 54

wrc 181 career high 249

war 1784 career high 144

mvps 13

triple crowns 9

championships 7

gold gloves 2

trout took advantage of the relatively weak pitching in the league and became the best hitter of all time if weve learned anything from this experiment its that mike trout is wasting his talents in americs"

i have plans to travel to south korea in the near future will i be ok

since the situation is continuously evolving its impossible to say check your countrys travel advisories for south korea and try to stay on top of the news to determine whether to continue with your travel plans or not

i plan to travel tofrom south korea will i run into any problems in other countries

at the time this is being written israel bahrain jordan kiribati samoa and american samoa have banned visitors from south korea and some airlinescountries have stopped direct flights to south korea since this is an ongoing situation its best to check with the airline you will be flying with to see if there are changes to your itinerary and the country you will be traveling to to see if there are any restrictions on people flying in from south korea

ps i appreciate the platinums for the past two threads but i hope there wont be anymore as i do not wish to be seen as milking the threads for karma or awards thank you"
daegu,my 90 days are ending soon,"my girlfriend is in the military and stationed in korea  long story short i came to visit and ive been here for about 2  and half months shes asking me to extend my stay here and im really contemplating this but im not quite sure how to go about it 

im currently in daegu and would probably remain here if i extend my stay for about 23 more months max

i read online that you can visit a total of 180 days in korea per year if traveling back and forth but im not sure of what the limitations are or if there is a wait period in between trips

ideally i would like to visit japan for a couple of days and re enter if that means that my visa would reset for the next 90 days 

if that were the case i would just do that if not what would be the best way to extend my stay my last day is the 31st of july for my visa to expire 
im from the us

any help would be appreciated thank you in advance 

update time


i booked a flight to fukuoka spent 4 days had a blast met some great people not as english friendly as i thought it would be but thats on me i dont know what i expected 

i didnt have to book a dummyfake flight to reenter korea at all coming back was very straightforward 


thank you for all of the suggestions they defiantly helped me with making this choice you guys rock 

i hope whoever needed this update it helps you all with how you approach your travel plans"
daegu,trip report second and final week,"hello i used this community a lot in my preparation for our first trip to korea and always enjoyed reading trip reports so i thought id give it a go myself hopefully its helpful or enjoyable for some of you

i already made a post about our first week if youre interested you can find the itinerary for sept 13th to 19th there 

i will recount our itinerary and point out general information that i hope will be helpful if youre planning a trip yourself

its going to be a long itinerary so lets give you my personal highlights of the second half of the trip

 joining a free class on tea etiquette in busan museum  we were the only participants and the teacher was very elegant and sweet it was an hour of calm in our trip and a completely new experience for us 
 hiking on saryangdo the hike was challenging but so worth it for the views and yes it even beat our hike to ulsanbawi rock 
 the food in general but especially our feast at millak fish market in busan ive never been served so much food meant only for two persons and it was affordable and delicious 

itinerary

sept 20th  flight to busan

we took a morning flight to busan collected our car and made our way to gamcheon cultural village since it was raining there werent a lot of people around and after a short stroll we found a sandwich shop for lunch with a view to enjoy it was a great stop on the way from the airport but im glad we didnt go out of our way to see it since there wasnt much to see or do that interested us the colored houses are beautiful though 

it was raining more heavily so we made our way to lotte department store in gwangbok to see busan from above just a word of advice bring your umbrella since the observatory is located on the roof with no shelter the view was great though if you want to stay inside tgi friday on floor 10 has a nice view over the harbor

we continued to make our way to the hotel noel business hotel  affordable free breakfast and parking and close to haeundae beach and had one last stop at the millak fish market close to gwangalibeach the market didnt have a lot of visitors but you could still buy fish from the ladies they can slice it up for you then and there and you can eat it in one of the restaurants upstairs we opted to just go directly to the 9th floor instead where we found a restaurant with a view over the beach we chose the cheapest set meal they had and received a feast we really tried but even though it was really tasty we just couldnt eat all of it they also brought out the wriggling octopus dish btw which was quite the mental block to overcome 

sept 21st  busan sightseeing

we got up just after dawn to visit haedong yonggungsa temple without the crowds and since it was pouring we definitely succeeded even though it rained it was beautiful to see the temple in a quiet atmosphere 

afterwards we had a reservation for a free tea ceremony at busan museum remarkably we were the only participants even though our teacher was sweet and explained the basics in english and it was free go check it out  they have multiple sessions a day and its a meditative break from traveling for foreigners its easiest to drop by a day before and make a reservation in person our teacher spoke mostly korean but knew enough english to communicate what to do and why 

after some shopping and our first bingsu we hopped on the sky capsule  reservations opened about 2 12 weeks before even though it says 2 weeks on their website and you can pay with a foreign card if you use your phone we thought itd be a bit sad to ride it in the rain since we wouldnt be able to see a lot but it was actually a welcome reprieve from the rain and the foggy exterior and high waves gave it its own mysterious character we enjoyed having a little picknick listen to music and watch the scenery change it was the one time i understood the hype on social media 

we ended our day with trying puffer fish for the first time we went to geumsubokguk haeundae head store since it was on the way back to our hotel and thought their soup just hit the spot after the rainy day 

sept 22nd  day trip to saryangdo 

i had read about this ridge walk on saryangdo in a blog it looked challenging and like it had great views so we drove the 2h to tongyeong took the 8 oclock ferry and hopped on the bus which took us to the other end of the island the bus driver already knew where we wanted to go when he saw us and dropped us off right at the start of the trail 

and what a trail it was it was quite challenging at some parts because you walk on the exposed ridge at times but they now have easier options for people with a fear of heights or are not so sure footed we were the only foreigners there and that led to a lot of interactions with other hikers who were quite curious what we were doing there everyone seemed excited to see us and we shared a lot of food and conversations in broken korean and english it took us about 5 hours to complete the hike so we were back on our ferry at 4 pm btw  the ferry had two rooms with heated floors and that is something i wished my country would have too having a nap after the hike was amazing 

sept 23rd  gyeongju and templestay

we drove to daegu for our templestay experience but decided to do a detour to see a few highlights of gyeongju we parked the car next to daereungwon tomb complex and strolled around the area  we visited cheomseongdae encircled wolji pond while enjoying the views of donggung palace and finished the circle by crossing woljeonggyo bridge we spent quite a bit of time in daereungwon tomb complex enjoying the peaceful park and learning more about the silla kingdom in the cheonmachong tomb they have a few interactive displays and explain how the tombs were build and how the society lived in that time for lunch we stopped by hongsi hanjeongsik which is situated in a hanok surrounded by a beautiful garden you have to take off your shoes and sit on the floor and get served a bunch of banchans we had a sweet server who made sure we knew we could get a free refill of each dish and took the time to explain every dish 

afterwards it was only a short trip to our temple we stayed at donghwasa temple the templestay participants have their own hanok we were a bit worried at first because we only had a blanket on the floor to sleep on but we all actually got a good nights sleep you share the room with one other person but every room had their own bathroom 

then we had an orientation where they explained the general rules and how to pray a cheerful young monk put everything we learned into practice and showed us meditation techniques as well afterwards we went straight to dinner at 5 pm the food is completely vegetarian and is eaten in silence since they consider food as an offering 

the evening service started with the monks banging on a very big drum and then switching to other instruments a fish a cloud and a bell it was fascinating to observe  every monk had their own rhythm and technique but they gave it their all we then quickly followed them into the temple and followed along their prayer im glad i had someone i could follow because obviously i had already forgotten most of what wed learned earlier 

one participant had requested the 108 prostrations so after the service we all switched to the community room and got to work for anyone who hasnt seen or done it yes you literally bow 108 times for that you kneel down and put your arms and head on the ground stand up without using your hands and start new this is preceded with a wish reflection or a resolution its quite the workout but after a while we all got into the flow and it was over before we knew it i definitely felt it the next morning though  and then it was lights out since we had to get up at 430h am

sept 24th  drive to sokcho

we started our day bright and early to attend the morning service and meditation it was quite a funny sight to have a monk lead us in stretching exercises afterwards  i think ill always have the mental picture of our monk in flowing robes trying to touch his big toe whenever ill do those exercises as a warm up before sports after breakfast at 530 am we had a few hours of free time most of us took another nap or went on a little hike at 1030 am we had our closing ceremony and were released back into the real world 

it was definitely an interesting experience to live like a monk for a day and thus learn more about their lives why i didnt put it down as one of my highlights is that both of us would have loved to get the opportunity to ask a few questions about buddhism i understand that the monks have things to do but i would have been happy with asking my questions to the templestay leader or any other person with a bit of knowledge we basically blindly followed the rules and prayers without having any understanding of the reasons i think both of us were hoping to understand the religion a bit better 

after our closing ceremony we continued our drive up north since we were back in the car a lot earlier than we anticipated we made a short detour to hahoe folk village it really is fascinating to walk along the old houses and it feels like you jumped back in time if it werent for all the cars the owners parked in front of their houses we were also just in time to see their mask dance every day at 2 pm we appreciated that they had english summaries projected so we were able to follow along the storyline it was an interesting sneak peek into a society from a different time i dont think i would have gone all the way just to visit hahoe but it was a very interesting break from our drive afterwards we hopped back on the shuttle bus to the parking area and drove the last 3ish hours to sokcho 

general advice we ran into the problem that no gas station at the rest stops of the highway wanted to accept our foreign credit cards we were luckily able to pay with cash so make sure you have a little cash on hand if you pass the toll station without paying try to remember where that was  that way you can pay the full amount at the next station we also asked our car rental to check if there were any outstanding fees and we could have payed them then and there 

sept 25th  hike to ulsanbawi rock

the weather forecast predicted rain for the next day so hiking up to ulsanbawi rock was our priority the car park was almost full when we arrived at 9 am so we were a bit concerned for the hike but once we left the food and souvenir stalls behind we were suddenly all alone on the trail the first 23 of the hike flew by until we reached the hermitage the monk was deep in prayer when we arrived and had quite the voice so we settled in listened and enjoyed the peaceful scenery and good thing we did because the last kilometer really tested our endurance the views though  wow this is one of those views you have to see for yourself because photos dont do it justice 

afterwards we didnt feel like a lot of walking anymore so we took the cable car to gwon geum seong fortress from where we scaled the rest of the stairs to the viewing point there we had lunch while enjoying the views a lot of families were there and the kids had fun scaling the rocks it was definitely not quiet but fun to people watch 

for the afternoon we headed for a few hours to the local jjimjilbang and hot springs you can find it by typing in  it felt a lot more local than aquafield goyang  i think we were the only foreigners the staff was very friendly we even got a face mask to wear during the bath their jjimjilbang is small but we were the only ones using it so it didnt feel cramped i liked their panoramic relaxation room the most  we spent a lot of time lounging on the bean bags overlooking seoraksan 

in the evening we walked around the neighborhood hotel business hotel camel  very futuristic and new furniture and ramen as a breakfast option a bit and ended up in abai village there we stumbled upon the ferry if youve never heard of it  the ferryman pulls the ferry across the river by himself with a wire rope and other passengers can help him a fun curiosity though nothing to seek out on its own a ride costs 500 won so its quite affordable according to the ferryman you can only get a ticket at abai village  not sure if thats true but we did only see a ticket machine on the abai side 

sept 26th  return to seoul

we woke up to heavy rain with no end in sight and decided to return early to seoul instead of another hike truly a shame because seoraksan national park is a beautiful place and we would have loved to explore the park more 

to at least spend some time in nature and since the weather was a lot better the closer we got to seoul we decided to do a railbike trip and ended up at gyeonggang railbike for no specific reason there are several in the area and it was the first one to pop up in naver starttimes are 9 1030 12 am and 2 330 5 pm and a bike costs 35k you ride the railbike for about 20 minutes take a break and ride it back again it isnt semi automatic though so its actually quite the exercise when you go uphill for us it was a great break from the car ride and we had a lot of fun all the other passengers we met along the way were also very cheerful and waved and cheered when we crossed ways 

back in seoul we spent the rest of the afternoon with some shopping in insadong and myeongdong and then decided to end the night with a bit of karaoke  we had a blast we went to musical noraebang it was okay they have a translation for the remote and a selection of english music which was quite dated though 

sept 27th  seoul

we had prebooked the morning tour of the secret garden and since our accommodation stay256 hanok guesthouse  spacious clean but shared bathroom was right at the edge of bukchon hanok village we walked through it on our way to the palace the tour was interesting and the park beautiful i actually forgot to take pictures because the guide was so engaging 

we then had lunch at doma insadong since we were in the area to finish off our souvenir shopping the food was great but we had even more fun to watch the cooks cooking our food in open flame and pressure cookers that gave off a lot of steam 

for the afternoon we had booked a makgeolli tasting at chunpoong brewery they specialize in high quality makgeolli and i have to say it really is good so good that were attempting to bring one back with special permission from the brewery because they usually dont sell it to tourists since the bottled makgeolli ferments a lot faster if it isnt kept cool they gave us a cooler and cooling pads and made us promise to store it in the fridge as long as possible well see if we can still drink it once were home 

after packing we had a few cocktails at bar cham for one last hurrah  it was several times recommended here and i can do the same now they specialize in korean spirits and their cocktails are complex and innovative they were the best cocktails weve had during our trip so we definitely ended it on a high note you should reserve via catchatable if possible  if not drop by right when they open and let them put you on a waiting list korean phone number necessary  we were 5 on the list and had to wait for about 80 minutes 

sept 28th  flight back home

and now were flying home what a trip weve had we had so many wonderful experiences here and i cant believe were already going home weve been able to actually get a feel for the culture and were so grateful for all the wonderful koreans we met along the way whove been so kind and helpful the thing im going to miss most though is going to be the food i hope i can find some good korean restaurants at home to get my fix going forward

thanks again to this community as well it has made researching and preparing for this trip so much easier "

daegu,what stands out about daegu,i am living and studying and daegu at the moment and i have been enjoying the city so far but out of every big city i have travelled to in korea daegu seems to have the least amount of uniqueness im sure there is much unique about daegu so i was wondering if you all could inform me thank you
daegu,a guide to koreas trains from a guy who really like trains,"updated on 10032024  addition of ktx chungyong maum nuriro removal of srt standing tickets workaround method



i might make this into a series or something but if it is heres the first one

ill be covering koreas high speed trainsktx srt intercity trainitx nuriro and all stop trainmugunghwa and the routes they travel in times they travel in



please read all the tips as lots of tips are shared by trains i only said them once

1 the trainsktxktx ktx sancheon ktx eum

ktxhttpspreviewredditeh3mm98ya8n91pngwidth900formatpngautowebpsf7fe994c370eeb0323a13f1155b615f55e85f841

many people know ktx from train to busan they are the first highspeed train in korea developed at 2004based on france tgv with a top speed of 305kmh189mphexcept ktx eum which is at 260kmh they are the most common highspeed trains youll see



current map of high to highish rails in korea ktx and srt run using these lines dotted lines are under constructionhttpspreviewreddit9iriw5kjc8n91pngwidth1000formatpngautowebpse94a94e9ac74da9025c9a664d68fc80d24e283eb

economy seats on ktx first class seats are usually in red and they offer much more leg room note that ktxeum sancheon chungyong has better economy seatshttpspreviewredditkz2ow7g8d8n91pngwidth620formatpngautowebps4ea2bafcdacbafb54088ede6be406548aac799a0

tips

 during rush hours ktx tends to run with two trains joined together make sure youre getting on the right section of the train if not get off at next station move to the right section of the train this is for srt as well
 in ktxand also some sancheon not applicable to eum and chungyong go for cab 5 when booking cab 5 used to be first class when it was first built it became economy later on due to lack of demand for first class it still has better seats and better leg room
 how do you tell if youre getting better seat by going cab 5 if you see a single seat on cab 5 it means that cab 5 used to be first class
 however you need a korail account to select seats while booking or the system puts you in a random seat it is difficult to set up a korail account as a foreigner so unless you have a railpass if you want to select seats while booking you need to go to the station and buy tickets you are allowed to buy tickets from one month before departure
 group purchase of ktx tickets on the computer shows a page that tells you to contact korail on the phone however group purchase on the korail appkorailtalk shows you checkout page right away while you are still unable to choose seats the system tries to assign seats so groups can sit together if it is available
 is first class worth it first class offer water bottlesvending machine free of charge earphones and sleep maskask conductors if you can get one wet wipes snackscovid might disrupt this newspapers better seats
 wifi is available in all seats actually all trains have wifi
 if theres an emergency pull the red lever front or back of the car near the door this will make conductors come running also installed on srt and itx
 they dont check your train tickets they only check tickets if the seat you are sitting is supposed to be empty this is same for all the other trains
 overhead luggage and luggage racks are available
 retractable seats between cars are for standing tickets the seats are first come first served

ktxchungyong

chungyongblue dragon fleet started to operate in 2024 with max speed of 320kph198mph being faster than other high speed trains in korea

due to track capacity limitations they operate usually around 305kph construction is underway to fix this problem and projected to be completed by 2028

on the outside chungyong looks the same with eum but inner working is all different

  best seats out of all high speed trains while they do not have first class and only business class is offered their business class easily outcompete first class seats
 worked out various kinks previous versions of ktx had better riding experience overall
 significantly more energy efficient
 currently making stops only on seouldaejeondongdaegueastbusan which less stops chungyong has minimum transit times note some other ktx also offers minimum stop service and they have similar transit time as well

if you can ride chungyong i highly recommend it

srt



despite it having a different name srt is basically ktx sancheon painted in purplehttpspreviewredditmoqkwzohg8n91pngwidth683formatpngautowebpsa99ecf7ee3b75a45141f827f6660334c1cca2748

srt and ktx share many similarities but differences are

 wider legroom compared to normal ktx
 srt only stationssuseo dongtan pyeontakjije srt does not go to seoul station
 srt runs on suseo to mokpo  suseo to busan
 srt and ktx are run by different companies although they are working together often you still have to buy tickets on different site
 srt first class offer all the amenities that ktx offers with an addition of mouthwash
 srt has limited coverage of train tracks but they come by very often on tracks they travel on
 cab 5 rule for ktx isnt the case for srt they have all the same seats except for first class
 srt does not accept korailpass no pass is available for purchase for srtthere is but this is more of an monthly subscription of tickets

itx

itxsamaul this is more common type of train youll see for itxhttpspreviewredditv5t0zwram8n91pngwidth910formatpngautowebps5e5e2a6ddb9a5a2a9940ba80336aaf80c6fc7e3a

itxchungchun this is the only 2nd decker train in korea not all cars are second deckershttpspreviewredditqha7ywagm8n91pngwidth683formatpngautowebps213681b498f2e77166824095f965b2a412744a0d

when i say itx in this post im referring to itxsamaul

 top speed to 150kmh
 these trains are very new and they offer better legroom then ktx
 no first class only economy
 wifi available
 personally seats are comfortable but long train rides can be hard



mugunghwa

note that mugunghwa has lots of engine cars and the looks may vary a lot if it has redwhiteblue color scheme its mugunghwahttpspreviewredditldf524jtu8n91pngwidth683formatpngautowebps605b8a40870bd5f0c5213b9c859dab3e009b52a9

 the slowest train in korea with top speed of 120130kmh
 however theyll stop in just about every station having excellent coverage
 these trains are old they definitely are not the most comfortable still has wifi and toilets condition of cabs may vary theyre not horrendous just okay
 they are to be decommissioned by 2027
 ride this if you want that long sightseeing train rides instead of getting from point a to point b really really fast

see detailed report here httpswwwredditcomrkoreatravelcommentsy080wgfollowupofaguidetokoreastrainsfromaguyutmsourceshareutmmediumweb2xcontext3httpswwwredditcomrkoreatravelcommentsy080wgfollowupofaguidetokoreastrainsfromaguyutmsourceshareutmmediumweb2xcontext3

maum

opinion on maum is quite divided among rail community in korea

some say its good some say its bad compared to mugungwha

 seen as a train that is supposed to replace mugungwha  its because while maum is technically one level higher than mugungwha but this is the lowest class of trains after mugungwhas decommission
 faster than maum
 but seats are hard and uncomfortable

see maum post here httpswwwredditcomrkoreatravelcomments167povskoreasnewtrainitxmaumexplainedbyaguywhoutmsourceshareutmmediumweb3xutmnameweb3xcssutmterm1utmcontentsharebuttonhttpswwwredditcomrkoreatravelcomments167povskoreasnewtrainitxmaumexplainedbyaguywhoutmsourceshareutmmediumweb3xutmnameweb3xcssutmterm1utmcontentsharebutton

httpspreviewreddito197u3nr3msd1jpgwidth800formatpjpgautowebpsfcc50da5e55388d5608021b90b419bf1e4a808ee

nuriro is quite rare but you can usually see one if you go south of dongdaegu station or near donghae station

imported from japan these trains were considered for mugunghwas replacement but due to high cost that plan never went through

expect mugungwha but bit newish

2 train tracks

general tips

 try to arrive 15 minutes before train departure
 people getting off the train has priority over people getting on wait for them to get off
 korea has no night trains there used to be until recently no longer if you see a travel guide mentioning night trains dont plan around thatthere actually is once a month night train but i doubt anyone here will plan on using this all trains operate around 5amuntil midnightmight go slightly over midnight
 if you see train tickets too expensive and you could bleed some time transferring trains can be a good idea osong and daejun is major train hub so you some part in highspeed train do some other part using cheaper trains give at least 10 minutes gap between transfer as trains can be delayed
 strain vtrain samaulnot itxsamaul just samaul is another less common trains these trains can be compared to being a little bit better then mugunghwa

the country

the republic of korea also known as south korea is home to over 50 million people over half live in the capital seoul making it the fifthlargest metropolis in the world what some may not know is that korea has over 3300 islands and 70 of the country is considered mountainous

korea is famous worldwide for its technological exports with tech companies such as samsung and lg the hallyu wave has made tv shows and films like the masked singer which the us ruined squid games descendants of the sun running man and train to busan gain audiences around the globe and the success of kpop stars like bts blackpink twice red velvet exo psy snsd super junior and more all contributing to the 14thhighest gdp in the world

sporting pedigree

korean football teams are everpresent in the afc champions league and the domestic kleague is competed by 12 teams and has seen 9 different winners since its inception in 1983 koreas bestknown footballers are son heungmin and manchester united champions league winner park jisung with other icons such as ahn junghwan fired by perugia after scoring against italy in 2002 and bundesliga legend cha bumkun aka cha boom for his rocket shots  

as a baseball powerhouse many korean players have played at the highest level in americas mlb including ryu hyunjin choo shinsoo and jiman choi korea is widely known for its pioneering and domination of the esports scene as well

other sports korean athletes have excelled in especially at the olympics are archery shooting and taekwondo korea is also the asian country with the most medals in the winter olympics

world cup history

korea is the most successful asian football team in history having participated in ten consecutive and eleven overall fifa world cup tournaments the most by any asian country yet of the 22 nations to have played 30 or more matches at the world cup korea has the lowest win ratio having won just six of their 34 games their highest finish was 4th place in their home 2002 world cup cohosted with japan defeating the likes of italy portugal and spain with guus hiddink at the helm

outside of the world cup korea has won the afc asian cup twice the east asian football federation championship five times and taken home three gold medals in the asian games other notable results include olympic bronze in 2012 beating archrivals japan for the medal and also knocking out hosts great britain in the quarterfinal and a fourthplace finish at the 2002 concacaf gold cup beating mexico along the way in a penalty shootout

road to qatar

the road to qatar began september 10 2019 with a 20 victory over turkmenistan with korea going on to finish top of their secondround group scoring 22 goals and conceding just once

advancing to the third round in the afc korea finished runnersup in the group 2 points behind iran scoring 13 goals and conceding 3

in 2022 korea faces uruguay in a round of 16 rematch from 2010 which korea lost then ghana before finishing up with a match as if it was fate paulo bentos old team portugal korea will be looking to improve on 2018s groupstage exit the only highlight being the 20 miracle of kazan win over germany in the final game after losing to sweden and mexico 

perhaps the most telling effect of the desire to start fresh 18 players from the 26man squad will be going to their firstever world cup the average age of the side is 27 years old

three players not named son heungmin or kim minjae to watch

lee kangin

the 2019 asian young footballer of the year is also the youngest south korean player in the history of the uefa champions league making his debut for valencia against chelsea at just 18 years of age 

unlike a few members of this korean team kangin is having a good season he was nominated la liga player of the month in august having moved to mallorca from valencia and scored against his old team when they played a few weeks ago 

he has played predominantly in the center as either a second striker or an attacking midfielder for korea and in addition to this has also played on the wings for mallorca kangin is the essential utility player every squad needs in a tournament this role has been magnified with the injury to son and the worrying lack of form among the other established forward players 

bento however said his selection of lee kangin was not intended to cover for son should the korean talisman be unable to play

kangin was in the squad for the friendlies against costa rica and cameroon but did not play kangin has so much talent but bentos stubbornness to stick to personal favorites means he has often not been allowed to impress which has frustrated many fans who can see he has huge potential

i always believed that as long as i played well in la liga and proved i could be an asset to the national team he bento would pick me kangin said in september i will try to prove to the coaching staff and my teammates that i can contribute a great deal to the team if i can do that i believe i will go to the world cup

hopefully kangin will be a player to watch on the field and not just warming the bench again hes still only 21  the youngest in the squad  and has a huge future ahead of him 

if qatar isnt the tournament in which he gets to show it uscanadamexico will be his stage for sure

jung wooyoung

he has been a regular fixture in the national team since making his senior debut in 2015 amassing over 60 caps and is an essential piece in bentos tactical style the 2012 olympic bronzewinning midfielder will sit in front of the back four and look to break up the oppositions play and can also slot in as an extra central defender if required not one to watch for fans of fancy football

with kim minjae behind him who is very adept at carrying the ball forward wooyoung may be seen covering for the inform napoli man should he take the ball out from the back as bento likes this korean team to do 

he walked off the pitch with an apparent leg injury late on in the recent iceland game but should be fine injuries have been an issue as of late unfortunately and this is expected to be his final world cup

i had some trouble ramping back up after getting injured jung has said of his left ankle and calf injuries from june ive been trying to get back to good form and ive not wasted a single day my goal is to be even better than my peak from the past and i think i am on the right path

wooyoung has played in qatar since joining xavis old team al sadd playing alongside the legendary spaniard and subsequently playing under him when he became manager korea will hope this opportunity to learn from one of the sports alltime greats will pay off in such a tricky group where koreas midfield really could be the key to unlocking the attacking potential held by the fastpaced forward players 

lee jaesung

another experienced member of the side over the years with over 60 caps to his name lee has scored twice this season for mainz in the bundesliga and has been a fairly regular fixture in the starting eleven he missed out on koreas summer friendlies through injury but is back and will look to make an impact whether as a winger or an attackminded central midfielder depending on how bento changes styles should complement hwang inbeom well 

no matter where he plays he can use his speed and stamina well his goal against werder bremen earlier this season saw him make a storming run from central midfield and left completely unchecked by the defense leaving him free to pick the ball up from a pass outside the penalty area and slot it past with ease albeit with a little help from a deflection also in his arsenal is his calmness under pressure and ability to use both feet breaking out a few stepovers or a cryuffturn to get himself out of trouble a fun one to watch

korea has made the most out of highintensity highstamina players before most famously the legendary park jisung with the likelihood most of their games will be spent chasing possession and waiting for an opportunity to break out lee jaesung is the perfect player for such a role as hes happy to go get the ball himself and run with it as far as he needs to before putting in a through ball to an overlapping player or going for goal himself 

honorable mentions

jeong wooyeong spent time in the bayern munich youth setup now 23 and at freiburg where the winger has 10 goals to his name and plenty of speed to burn maybe another who gets their shot during the next cycle though

hwang inbeom versatile central midfielder has been everpresent for olympiakos this season and is a trusted lieutenant for paulo bento having moved to the greek side after consulting with the former olympiakos boss

cho yumin if youre watching him something has gone wrong a lastminute inclusion due to injuries yumin plays for daejeon hana citizen they are in the korean second tier though they did win the league and are being promoted to the first tier he is the only member of the squad to play in the korean second tier 



points of discussion

the tactics  bento ball

exbenfica and sporting manager paulo bento was appointed to lead the korean team in 2018 following their disappointing world cup campaign with a contract running through the end of the 2022 world cup he has become the longestserving head coach in the national teams history but has also proved to be one of the most controversial

bento has been criticized for his conservative tactics his reluctance to be flexible in tactical styles and player selection and his inability to play his players in their best positions all familiar stories i am sure for portugal fans during his 4 years in charge of the seleo das quinas

under bentos management korea has been focused on playing it out from the back preferring a 4132 or a 4231 formation he recently experimented with a 4141 with mixedtopoor results in the friendlies against brazil chile and paraguay and the eaff tournament against hong kong and japan

in the 10 win over iceland on november 11 bento went with a back three for the first time since september 2019

regardless of the chosen tactic the playstyle largely remained the same keeping possession in the midfield and using sweepers to get the ball moving forward often worked against more inferior teams during south koreas world cup qualifiers but against koreas world cup group stage opponents portugal uruguay and ghana the strategy may not be so effective bento has been heavily criticized for not having a plan b 

in my opinion it doesnt make sense to change our style its much worse in my opinion for us to play differently in a way that were not used to because if we dont have time to correct certain things its almost impossible to make too much of a difference  paulo bento

in the disappointing 00 draw with iraq during qualifying forward players were often isolated when the midfield got pressed and manmarked bento then insisted on repeating the same patterns of attack relying heavily on wingbacks to try and spread the play to the lesscrowded areas of the pitch but iraq did not take long to figure out the game plan and block them

against highpressing teams korea has often been outplayed and overwhelmed notably in the 51 friendly loss to brazil who dominated the press marked son out of the game and kept korea off the ball to claim almost 60 total possession the chastening 30 friendly loss to japan last year almost cost bento his job as japan pressed korea out of the game korea was unable to create passing lanes forward and the lone striker in the 4141 was isolated and ineffectual 

i admit that things didnt work out the way we intended them to in the first half we only ended up passing the ball around the middle of the field we only got a little better at it in the second half  paulo bento after the defeat to japan

when it works it works well and korea has plenty of versatile attacking options but the worry is that teams can figure out their gameplan quickly and bento isnt good enough  or even willing  to find a fix this leads us to the next talking point

the players  versatile unbalanced and out of form

before the qatar world cup there is a long way to go and there are too many homework assignments to solve the two puzzles of players and tactics when someone has a problem i dont see a player who can fill it  park moonsung commentator

its no secret that last seasons premier league golden boot winner son is the star of this team to call korea a oneman team is unfair but it does merit some discussion 

earlier this year bento was forced to take a squad of only domesticbased players to the east asian football federation championship the tournament fell outside the official fifa calendar so many clubs did not release their star players leaving the likes of son and kim minjae unavailable korea met expectations by dispatching hong kong and china 30 each but then in their final game against japan fell 30 themselves and recorded a dismal one shot on target

the tournament was meant to be an audition for those domestic league players looking to stake their claim for a spot on the final world cup roster which would need this domestic depth to complement the core overseas players the final squad has 12 players who are signed to clubs outside of korea including two in the bundesliga and three in the premier league

but the loss to japan exposed south koreas worrisome lack of depth and together with the mixed friendly results particularly the 10 win over iceland with a koreanbased team only shows that many korean players may have a lack of experience against top opposition both domestically and internationally

making things worse is that this overseas core has been struggling this season hwang heechan has not been struggling at wolves and hwang uijo has been making cameo appearances on loan for olympiakos since making the move from bordeaux to nottingham forest if goals are to be scored these players need to leave their club form behind and switch up the gears for their country especially now because the one man expected to lead this time by himself if needed is now a doubt  and who admittedly has not been having a great domestic season himself even before the injury

in koreas favor is that kim minjae is having an outstanding season for napoli and there is plenty of young attacking talent ready to show up and show off if given the chance the worry is though like many teams that if the core isnt performing or has an injury problem can the backups really be counted on when it matters

the injury  risk and reward

the unthinkable happened son was injured playing for spurs against marseille just weeks before the world cup sustaining a fractured eye socket which required surgery this injury has thrown a huge wrench in koreas world cup preparations so close to the tournament 

weve been informed by tottenham that son heungmin had completed a successful procedure but since the surgery just took place its too early at this point to discuss his status for the world cup the national teams medical staff has remained in contact with tottenham regarding sons injury  statement from the korean football association

son is a warrior having played with a fractured arm before it didnt seem to have a big impact on his form however this injury is very different of course

being an aerial threat and scoring headers has never really been a focal part of his game his pace and technical skills on his feet have always been his strongest points and this injury is unlikely to stop him from being able to replicate this kind of play

players going to a major tournament while injured is nothing new wayne rooney was in the england squad for the 2006 world cup despite his broken metatarsal he returned to action within six weeks of suffering the injury only missing out on englands opening game 

others have played through facial injuries before notably kevin de bruyne he fractured his eye socket in the 2021 champions league final but within three weeks he was masked up and playing for belgium at the euros

the question is then how much of a role on the field can he play

he might sit out the opener or at least come off the bench to get a feel for things if hes able no doubt hes raring to go he needs just one goal to surpass the record of koreas alltime top scorer at world cups ahn junghwan and park jisung are currently tied with him as the recordholders with 3 goals 

should son not be able to play its still a great benefit to bring him along as part of the squad he embodies korean football and can be an inspiring presence in the dressing room just as much as he could be out on the field

we are in contact with him with the tottenham medical department but about the exact time the exact day he can train with the team we dont have that information yet  bento

suwon samsung bluewings forward oh hyeongyu is also travelling with the team to qatar as a reserve player as cover for son 

he may get his chance  even if not for son hwang heechan missed the first training session at the time of writing with what team officials have described as left hamstring discomfort fullback kim jinsu has also been battling a hamstring problem he didnt take part in any team sessions only doing individual workouts 

expectation

south koreas first group h match against uruguay is on november 24th the taegeuk warriors will then face ghana on november 28th and portugal on december 2nd all three matches will be played at the education city stadium in al rayyan west of doha

hopefully son is able to take part despite his injury an expectation shared by the players would be korea progressing to the round of 16

we want to take this one match at a time and reach the round of 16 i am sure everyone on the team understands what we should do to get to that point  kim younggwon

but the numbers dont lie with opta crunching the numbers and giving korea an 82 chance to make the last 16

that lack of faith isnt shared by the players or fans who will cheer on this group no matter what

plus with so much young talent coming through  theres always next time right

weve been receiving a lot of posts lately from people worried about coronavirus and how it might affect their travel plans your friendly rsolotravel mods have assembled the following faq please read this first and please use this thread to post any of your travel questions related to coronavirus

note this is an updated megathread as of march 12 2020 you can find the first megathread herehttpswwwredditcomrsolotravelcommentsevscdpcoronavirusfaqthemegathread and the second herehttpswwwredditcomrsolotravelcommentsf8zf6xcoronavirusfaqthemegathreadupdated

should i cancelpostpone my travel plans

currently in line with the recommendations of multiple governments around the world we recommend that you avoid nonessential travel if you are at home stay at home if you are abroad try to return as soon as possible 

if you must travel you should always check and follow the latest health guidelines from your government authorities and from medical professionals travel forums andor random strangers on the internet are not reliable sources of health information

below we have assembled information about the hardest hit countriesregions and some of the most prominent restrictions however as of midmarch it has become impossible for us to track all coronavirus restrictions in place as the situation is evolving too quickly 

if you still decide to travel check local conditions on an ongoing basis and be prepared that the situation in any one country may change dramatically on short notice keep in mind that visiting a highrisk country may result in restrictions on onward travel andor quarantine requirements in your next destination or in your home country

asia

 travel to hubei province  wuhan is under level 4 advisory by most world governments and is heavily restricted by the chinese government if you have plans to visit hubei province you should probably cancel or postpone

 travel to mainland china is under level 3 avoid nonessential travel or level 4 avoid all travel advisory by most western governments many airlines have cancelled flights and are issuing cancellation or rebooking waivers if you have plans to travel tothrough mainland china in the near future you will probably want to postponecancel your travel plans

 travel to south korea the us and new zealand are among governments who have upgraded their travel warnings to level 3 avoid nonessential travel for south korea as a whole other governments including canada and australia are still maintaining a level 2 warning exercise a high degree of caution the uk is advising against nonessential travel to daegu or cheongdo only

 travel to other parts of eastsoutheast asia is not currently under advisory however countries reporting significant cases of coronavirus include japan singapore hong kong taiwan and thailand among others in some or all of these countries there may be restrictions on transportation cancellation of public gatherings and other attempts to stem the spread of the virus

europe

there are currently widespread closures and travel restrictions due to coronavirus all across continental europe this politico articlehttpswwwpoliticoeuarticlehoweuropeisrespondingtothecoronaviruspandemic summarises the state of affairs in each country however as the situation is changing hourly please check the latest local conditions before travelling

we have summarised some of the main restrictions in the most heavily affected countries italy spain france germany here

 italy on march 9 the italian government announced widespread lockdown measures across the entire country that severely curtail internal movement and have shut down cultural institutions restaurants cafes and all shops other than pharmacies and supermarkets the lockdown remains in place until at least april 3 most international flights have been cancelled austria and slovenia have largely closed their land borders to italy unless travellers can produce medical certificates if you have travel plans to italy you should contact your airline or travel company to arrange alternate plans

 spain as of march 15 the country has followed italys lead in establishing a broad lockdown internal and external travel is restricted nonessential shops restaurants and cultural institutions eg museums and tourist attractions have been closed public events have been cancelled the largest numbers of cases have been reported in the madrid area

 france as of march 15 the country has followed the lead of italy and spain in establishing a broad lockdown nonessential shops restaurants and cultural institutions eg museums and tourist attractions have been closed public events have been cancelled the largest numbers of cases have been reported in paris and the region of grandest

 germany as of march 16 the country has establishing a broad lockdown nonessential shops restaurants and cultural institutions eg museums and tourist attractions have been closed public events have been cancelled internal travel has been discouraged and land borders with denmark poland the czech republic austria switzerland and luxembourg have been closed states with the largest number of infections include north rhinewestphalia incl cologne dsseldorf bavaria incl munich and badenwrttemberg incl stuttgart

middle east

 israel on march 10 the israeli government asked all tourists to leave the country and announced that all foreigners arriving in israel must selfquarantine for 14 days regardless of origin travel to israel is not possible until these measures are lifted

 travel to iran is discouraged by a level 3 or level 4 advisory by most western governments iran is currently experiencing some of the worst numbers of cases of the virus outside of china with widespread concerns that the official case numbers may be severely underreported travel is not recommended until the covid19 outbreak in iran is under control

north america

 united states on march 11 president trump announced a 30day ban on travellers from europe except the uk entering the united states the ban does not apply to american citizens their immediate relatives and legal permanent residents however many flights between continental europe and the us have been cancelled so american citizens and residents may be forced to make alternative travel arrangements to return many states or cities including washington state and new york city are in lockdown with restaurants bars nonessential shops and cultural institutions closed

travel to other countries rsolotravel currently does not recommend nonessential travel be aware that cases are increasing in countries around the world carefully consider your travel plans not just for the risk of getting the coronavirus but also due to the possibility of lockdown or quarantine measures being imposed travel bans by your home or onward country affecting your plans or the possibility that your travels might put others in your life especially elderly people or those with compromised immune systems at risk note that the situation is rapidly changing well do our best to keep this thread updated but you should monitor the latest updates for your destination before you travel

what about flights connecting through affected regions

if you have travel plans that were scheduled to connect via affected regions most airlines may be able to rebook you on an alternate routing via a different connection either on their own flights or via an airline partner it helps when contacting your airline to have researched several alternate routings that might work for your date so you can propose them to the agent if your airline cancels your flight and does not offer any rebooking options check with your travel insurance company as you might be able to obtain some compensation

what steps can i take to protect myself during my travels

the who recommends standard commonsense protection measures such as maintaining basic hand and respiratory hygiene and safe food practices and avoiding close contact when possible with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing 

are there any restrictions on entering or travelling through countries

a number of countries including the united states australia new zealand and japan have imposed restrictions or bans on travellers from affected regions including mainland china south korea iran italy spain france and germany andor who have visited those regions in the past 14 days israel has restricted entry for all travellers regardless of origin there are also numerous restrictions on internal travel within continental europe check local conditions in advance

im booked to go on a cruise should i worry

if you plan to travel on a cruise you may be following the news of several high profile quarantines of cruise ships notably the diamond princess which was quarantined off the coast of japan resulting in hundreds of passengers falling ill and the grand princess which was quarantined off the coast of california with 21 confirmed cases aboard many governments including the us state department and the public health agency of canada have therefore advised against cruise ship travel

a number of cruise lines have announced preventative measures including increased disinfection standards restrictions on boarding for passengers from affected regions and more check with your cruise line for the latest updates before you travel

as of march 12 carnival corporation which operates the princess line of cruises announced that all princess cruises would be suspended for 2 months

im of asian backgroundethnicity and am concerned about racism during my travels should i worry

its been an unfortunate side effect of the coronavirus that many people including travellers of asian background or ethnicity have reported a spike in racist or xenophobic attacks either because people fear anyone who looks like they may be from china or simply because racists are using this outbreak as a license for their hate speech there is never any good excuse for racism and coronavirus surely is not one having said that reports by travellers of asian background have varied wildly including firsthand accounts on this subreddit if this affects you and you would like to discuss your experiences or have concerns about travelling to particular areas please share them in the thread below

what about travel insurance

if you had travel plans booked to an affected region prior to the outbreak of coronavirus and now wish to postpone or cancel your trip you may be wondering if your travel insurance will cover you thishttpswwwcanadianunderwritercaclaimsinsandoutsoftravelinsuranceamidcoronavirusoutbreak1004173736 is a good primer written for canadians but with general advice that applies to people from many countries the nutshell version is if you had travel plans to china or other affected countries and made your bookings prior to the issuance of travel advisories from your country your insurance policy will likely cover you in the event of cancellation or rebooking for any outofpocket charges that you cant get back from your airline or travel providers if you booked after the travel advisories were issued you probably arent covered

update a number of travel insurance companies have announced in the past few days that they are updating their policieshttpswwwcbccanewsbusinesscoronavirusmanulifetugotravelinsurance15486117 to exclude any coronavirusrelated claimshttpswwwabcnetaunews20200306coronaviruscovid19travelinsuranceexclusionconfusion12027638 due to the unpredictability of this health crisis if you choose to book travel you should not assume that your travel insurance policy will cover you in the event of a health emergency cancellation rerouting or quarantine abroad you may want to look into cfar cancel for any reason policies you should also review your insurance policys medical coverage terms and conditions especially if you have any health issues or if you will be travelling to countries where healthcare is very expensive eg the us

if i travel to an affected area what about my job

many companies are imposing restrictions on employees who have travelled to affected areas requiring them to selfquarantine work from home or take time off prior to returning to work here is a brief guide on how to selfisolatehttpswwwtheglobeandmailcomcanadaarticleifyouarereturningtocanadafromanywhereyouneedtoselfisolate if you have travel plans and are concerned speak to your companys hr department

what other resources can i consult

make sure youre getting your information from a reputable medical source and not from random media reports which tend to overhype the situation here are some sources you can consult

 the world health organizations advice for the publichttpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovelcoronavirus2019adviceforpublic and their latest international travel advicehttpswwwwhointith20202701outbreakofpneumoniacausedbynewcoronavirusen

 the center for disease control cdc has an information and update pagehttpswwwcdcgovcoronavirus2019ncovindexhtml

daegu,my journey as an american living in china,"ive been living in hangzhou china for more than 8 years wonderful city thats about as safe as a place can be im married to a local chinese girl weve been together for 8 years and married for 5 years we have two young children as well around november last year i decided i needed to visit the usa because it had been 2 years since my last return and i greatly wanted to see my aging grandpa

my wife and i decided i would take the trip alone and we would travel to usa as a family during the next summer i left and arrived in usa january 19th about one day before the major news started breaking about a novel coronavirus breaking out in wuhan and greater hubei cases were also popping up in other areas around china as well if i remember correctly in hangzhou we had heard rumors as early as late december and throughout january about a mysterious sars like disease but it sounded like rumors so hardly anyone took notice not a big deal right 

i was stateside a day maybe two and the news just swamped everything else we know the story from there they started locking down everything and more and more crazy news kept pouring out my wife was at my inlaws for the festival time just outside of the city they have a house and thankfully dont live in some tiny apartment in the middle of the city i became more and more concerned but my wife said to stay put in usa dont come back as it isnt safe the lock down got more severe and the case number exploded i was visibly nervous in front of my relatives what kind of husband leaves his family behind during a time like this everyone assured me theyd be ok and at this point there is nothing i could do i contemplated rushing back but my wife said they couldnt travel even if they wanted to staying out was the absolute safest thing they could do

despite the shit news i tried to have a great time with my family my siblings and i went ahead with our planned trip to costa rica which was amazing by the way many people jokingly called me corona boy my brothers neighbor told me to get out of his garage when he learned i was the one living in china i told everyone i dont live in the place that got ravaged but that didnt do much i closely monitored my health regardless and wore a mask anywhere with a crowd during my first two weeks

i was supposed to come back to china february the 12th but obviously my return flight was cancelled the airline said the earliest they could return me to china was april 24th but they could route me to a different city if i wanted i agreed to a flight on the 18th of february to seoul south korea because news was scary about tokyo which was my only other option i was able to easily buy a ticket from seoul back to hangzhou with one layover in between i arrived into seoul on the afternoon of february 19th their time and had two nights to rest before my next flight

my timing is ridiculous because the night i arrived the news was starting to light up about possible infections in daegu and the 31st person being found to be infected i took a bus into incheon next to seoul and closer to the major airport i didnt want to go anywhere super populated but didnt want to waste my day in the hotel nearly 99 of everyone was wearing a mask as the worry from the previous day was hitting hard i ate a nice lunch and strolled around for a bit and bought a couple of more masks for my supply i stocked up early into my visit to usa by the way 40 n95 respirators and two boxes of procedure masks among other things after my stroll i got onto the city bus back to the hotel 

that evening i didnt eat and just followed the news on my phone i sprayed my clothing from the day with disinfectant my suitcases too the next morning i put on my mask went downstairs for breakfast luckily the hotel was mostly empty but was perturbed because the staff werent wearing masks i took the shuttle to the airport and was off every single person i encountered wore a mask i rubbed my seat and the seat next to me with alcohol wipes when i landed in the first city in china customs was different everyone had to sign a paper declaring their health masks were mandatory and each individual was checked for their temperature and screened for any symptoms the rest of customs was easy picked up my bags and went back into the airport to check in for my next flight my temperature was checked before i got my boarding pass and again before going through security and once again before boarding the plane several hours later i arrived in hangzhou before 10 oclock and was told i would need to apply for a local health code the code keeps track of where youve been and what time if it is green youre free to move around and use local services like taxis supermarkets even return to your community if it is yellow you must quarantine for 7 days and red means quarantine for 14 days my code was green but i planned on self quarantining for at least a week before seeing my wife and kids

today was day 7 no symptoms yet i think except for some reflux probably due to travel anxiety and stress ive gone outside very minimally just to buy food and water  ive had a bit of a tickle in my throat but its probably nothing other than my head messing with me at least i hope thats the case about an hour ago a guy called me up and said he works for the local government and wanted to clarify some things he came to my apartment and verified that i returned 7 days ago that i flew from usa to korea and then here i said yes sir he asked me if i was alone in the apartment and i confirmed and said my wife and kids are at the inlaws and that i am doing a self quarantine he asked me very politely to continue the self quarantine for the full 14 days he then said that i shouldnt go outside at all if i needed to get food or water or what have you that i can contact him at any time and he will have someone bring it to my door he gave me his wechat number his phone number and the number to the community office he asked me to contact him if i needed anything even just someone to talk to
he told me that if i begin to feel any symptoms at all that i please contact him immediately and he would arrange a ride to the nearest hospital for the coronavirus by the way here in hangzhou they have basically designated two hospitals to handle the virus all cases go to either one of them  he informed me that it is best to begin treatment as soon as possible he assured me that i am probably in one of the best equipped citys in the world for handling this virus and to not worry hangzhou china is a very developed and modern city by the way 

my anxiety has been through the roof lately all the news and my own worries has been stressful to say the least but that visit just now has truly put me more at ease they are so well prepared here and definitely dont want another wuhan to happen i hope that everyone reading this can be prepared and take caution but also dont let the stress take over too much cheers and good health to you all"
daegu,do you ever notice regionaldated gyopo korean accents,"have you ever noticed someone of korean descent speaking korean and been able to pick up on the region theyre from meaning either where their family originally came from in korea or where they grew up abroad how about when their families left korea

the question came up at a meetup with some new friends some of us are koreanamerican from different cities la nyc seattle indianapolis others were koreans who emigrated more recently for workschool according to the koreans they can kinda tell where a koreanamerican is from based on how we speak the language even if spoken well

when speaking korean some like myself from la tend to go upanddown in pitch and usually end our sentences going up in tone like were asking a question  its definitely a carryover trait of how we speak english the new yorkers sounded more nasally or more monotone midwesterners really drew out every word when speaking the ones from seattle sounded more choppy and short although that could also be because their family was from daegu  for all of us though they could clearly tell who was koreanamerican  fluent but still noticeable  i find it really interesting  

something else they could tell was when our families moved or who we primarily grew up speaking korean with because many of us used dated words and expressions that were considered very old like we were either time travelers or spies 

have any of you picked on something similar"

daegu,requestsomeone in daegu south korea to show us around in may and travel tips,my boyfriend and i are planning to travel to daegu south korea then to japan in may we are looking for someone who can give us tips on where to stay how to get to japan from daegu things to do etc we are also looking for someone who can show us around daegu if you know of fun things in exchange well bring something from california us that you need want thank you 
daegu,can someone enlighten me about daegu andor daejeon,"hello all ive decided to visit south korea on short notice and im not very well prepared we are going to start our 4week trip in seoul and end in busan ive been looking at cities to stop midway to break up the journey and to see some lesserknown cities in south korea could anyone tell me about daegu and daejeon what you likeddisliked them and things to do and see there

should i skip them altogether and go elsewhere would just like some advice from those more experienced in korean travel thank you "
daegu,angry soccer fans call for firing worldclass con man jrgen klinsmann and kfa head and jaebol boss chung mongkyu they later modify demands to call for klinsmanns deportation and ask song heungmins father to take over the national team,"hecklers and protestors were gathered earlier today to call for the firing of south koreas national soccer coach jrgen klinsmann and the head of the korean football association chung mongkyu  later they changed their demands and called for klinsmanns deportation  we dont want him to set his foot on the korean soil again  the only problem however is that klinsmann is already back in his adopted home country  in newport beach in the california republik  what they probably mean is that they want klinsmann to be declared a persona non grata  this is the step south korea takes to its own citizens that are draft dodgers and went overseas to evade its armed service requirement

earlier klinsmann took part in a zoom conference call across the pacific where he learned of the recommendation that he be fired  the recommendation was made by a kfa committee dedicated to the technical and strategic review of the national team  but this is a recommendation only and has no teeth for enforcement  the final decision is in the hands of chung mongkyu  the kfa head that hails from the zillionaire hyundai jaebol family  chung is the former ceo of hyundai motors and currently heads hdc the construction arm of hyundai that builds highrise residential towers  plus he owns two kleague franchises and heads some halfdozen other positions in soccer and athletics  he is the face of korean soccer  it was was indeed chung that personally hired klinsmann  how he did so despite vehement opposition from certain kfa factions analysts and fans is now part of the lore documenting many decades of administrative incompetence of the korean football association

httpspreviewredditalfm1yy5rpic1pngwidth1920formatpngautowebpsf0b13665badc1047ad2803eb0e9df45b4a38b828

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtpp9dji7biehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtpp9dji7bie

i thought at first this particular band of rather aging protestors was engaged in a parody protest  but no they are dead serious  their banner reads

immediately fire worldclass con man and grifter jrgen klinsmann who embarrassed 50million korean people  kfa president chung mongkyu who abused his power to hire this international con man must resign and take full responsibility

the protestor on the left is holding a wooden bar labeled bar of justice  the protestor on the right is holding a deflated soccer ball that symbolizes zerostrategy kicktheballdownthefield playing style  korean fans derisively call this type of playing style kickball soccer  in contrast with the tikitaka style of european soccer that emphasizes accurate passes and lateral movement  during its embarrassing semifinal loss to jordan klinsmanns team struggled to establish any offensive tempo and had zero shots on goal

to understand this and other protests being staged by angry fans you have to be familiar with several recent developments surrounding south koreas national team

 former presidential candidate hong joonpyo now mayor of the city of daegu is calling for klinsmanns ouster httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfgqm4gpk2zmppyguw7zmn7ksa7zgcio2btoumsoykpounqa3d3dhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfgqm4gpk2zmppyguw7zmn7ksa7zgcio2btoumsoykpounqa3d3d  hong became famous in 2018 when he traveled to the us to make a case for south korea to develop nuclear weapons of its own  other politicians are starting to murmur and voice their concerns about the national team  yoon ally and national assemblyman kwon seongdong urged we are done examining coach klinsmanns performance  the football association has to now act  piling on the football team particularly by politicians is a national pastime only 6 weeks away from the national election  elections are typically very close in south korea agitating for the ouster of common villains klinsmann and chung could garner much needed lastminute votes
 it has come to light that two korean soccer stars son heungmin and lee kangin engaged in a fisticuff where son dislocated his finger  this happened the night before the semifinal game  son was seen wearing a sling to keep his finger stationary during the game against jordan  other players confirmed the tiff and some players came out against lee claiming that hes headstrong and doesnt listen to senior players  some soccer fans are now pointing out why former nationalteam coach paulo bento never called up lee during his tenure as he may have noted lees disruptive behavior that went against team unity  fans of son have taken over lees instagram account and are leaving hatefilled comments to lee who has since apologized  but now they started to attack the instagram account of lees older sister who used to post and brag about his kid brothers exploits httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv5ju4zw1ohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv5ju4zw1o
 several investigative pieces have emerged in south korea regarding klinsmanns failed coaching tenures at bayern munich toronto hertha bsc and his 6year tenure coaching the us soccer team  at focus has been his lack of strategic vision and football philosophy as well as his lax work ethic  particularly his penchant for travel to farflung places ostensibly to watch national team players play in foreign leagues  but the guy apparently liked to mix business with pleasure and his claim that hes checking out players rang hollow when he ran several businesses of his own  his business success depended on him being  a soccer celebrity  klinsmann was a cheerleadertouristcoach who liked to be seen celebrating goals but could never hold his own in the rarefied field of tactical and technical soccer  drawing xs and os to illustrate soccer formations was not exactly his forte he was a pom pomwielding cheerleader who never met a camera he didnt like  by the time his us stint was over everyone was made aware of his act except for the korean football association who may not have been sophisticated enough to tell apart a cheerleading celebrity from a technically sound and cerebral coach  httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrfhh7kik6wlistpl05hhnconqb3zpsrh2znppvjer4p2vqindex7httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrfhh7kik6wlistpl05hhnconqb3zpsrh2znppvjer4p2vqindex7

later the hecklers ended their protest by calling for son heungmins father to take over the national team  huh  sons dad is son woongjeong who runs a youth soccer academy in chooncheon in the province of gangwon  earlier he had left an enigmatic comment regarding his sons exploits as the korean team made it to the semifinals at quatar  the korean national team should never win the asian cup  if it does the current woes and decay mismanagement by the korean football association will continue  this earlier comment resonated with the protestors who became enraged upon witnessing kickball soccer being played in the teams onesided loss to jordan

but son sr has no experience coaching at the adult level  it doesnt matter  the sons are a family of saints in south korea  they can do anything"
daegu,bus question ,"hello

i use my hana bank card to pay when using the busses i tap in but i dont tap out i see some people tapping and some not

daegu,travelling to korea tips on how to manage my time,"hey everyone

im heading to korea for the mobility exco landing late night at incheon airport on the 21st ill spend one night in incheon any suggestions for budgetfriendly places to stay before traveling to daegu for two nights as an invited guest after that id love to spend an extra night in daegu before heading back to seoul to spend the remainder of my time there before my flight on the 27th

would you guys recommend booking my hotels pre landing or is it bettercheaper to do it locally

im trying to budget around 250350 cad in total excluding flights and my first twonight stay in daegu is that doable

any advice on how to manage my time effectively and what to do during my stay would be greatly appreciated what are mustsee spots in daegu and seoul any tips on getting around

daegu,ship suitcases from daegu to incheon airport,"hi

i am leaving the country soon with my tiny dogs and need to travel from daegu to incheon with them a 3 big suitcases by ktx or bus

can anyone help me or give me suggestions "
daegu,savings for first year teacher,"hi there

just curious to hear opinions on this my biggest goal aside from being a good teacher is saving money i dont need to travel a whole lot but would like to visit maybe one or two other countries before or after my contract during contract i think id be fine with only taking short trips outside my area once a month would like to visit seoul busan and jeju at least once and anything else would be spontaneous

looking for a contract in either daegu or gwangju would be open to other areas including jeju

my goal is to save at least 5k usd in a year im trying to save enough before contract start to pay off all my bills back home while gone but may need to pay 350 a month is saving at least 5k in a year realistic on a starting hagwon salary

edit thank you all so much for the helpful responses its really encouraging to think i might actually be able do this with my goal in mind

some things ill adjust based on your tips
only travel once every other month
cook as much as possible use coupang fresh to order groceries
stay in cheaper hotel accommodations like yeogwans
dont use major cellphone carriers use mvnos

some things i still have questions about if youd be so kind as to fill me in more
are groceries really expensive what do you usually get to be frugal
are medications affordable and easy to get
gonna do more research on this but are severance and pensions supposed to be in contract or just severance pension you go through us embassyother similar type of body

daegu,45k for a month,"ive read various questions here but i still havent found a concrete answer im planning to go to korea in november of next year for a month and im thinking of saving up 45k this amount would cover accommodation food activities and transportation

for accommodation i plan to stay in inexpensive places like hostels or something on airbnb based on my research here airbnb seems quite affordable

for food all meals would be eaten out but im not interested in anything too fancyjust to experience local cuisine and traditional dishes

as for activities i have a better idea since its easy to check entry fees but it would mainly involve visiting tourist spots and exploring the cities

for transportation i plan to travel around the country visiting other cities for now the route would be seoul  andong  daegu  jinju  busan  gyeongju  gangneung  sokcho but it may change

in short the trip should be as simple as possible im not aiming for luxury but rather to really get to know the country and enjoy my time there do you think 45k would be enough to do this food and transportation seem to be inexpensive and from what ive seen i can save quite a bit on accommodations but id like a more concrete opinion im from a country with a weaker currency so if i need to save more i might have to postpone my trip by a few months

thank you for the help"
daegu,which express bus in korea,"which express bus company do you recommend for travelling from daegu to busan during chuseok
im stuck in daegu on 15 september because there is no train left for us"
daegu,lastminute trip to busan a 6d6n trip report,"third times the charm having been to seoul twice ive always wanted to visit busan with my parents and discover another side of korea two weeks ago we were supposed to fly to taiwan for the long weekend but flights got cancelled due to the typhoon

upon further browsing i saw flights from cebu to busan within that same week that would cost us less than php 6k each so we decided to push through with another trip and this time our first in busan

we only focused on city destinations as parents easily got tired so our stops were limited including gwanggalli beach haeundae beach gamcheon cultural village blueline park sky train cheongsapo daritdol observatory biff square

more than the itinerary what id like to highlight here is that we booked our roundtrip cebubusan flights only a day before and we were still able to score a php 59k airfare including baggage via jinair

why cebu we are already based here so theres no need for a connecting flight to manila plus here are many other reasons to consider

1 cebu has flights to at least 4 korea destinations seoul busan daegu cheongju
2 cebu is served by both asiana airlines and korean air and smaller carriers jinair jeju air tway air aerok thus increasing competition resulting to availability of lower airfares some of their flights are exclusive to cebu alone within ph some of these flights have really ideal travel times as they would allow you to have a full day both in your departure and return
3 even smaller carriers mentioned above are generous on handcarry luggage at 10kg
4 by next year terminal fee of naia will increase so if youre neither manila or cebubased youll expect to have lower airfares via cebu

cost breakdown

 accommodation 1080482
 activities 152220
 airfare 1787577
 essentials 147190
 insurance 201800
 kr transportation 472321
 meals 649767
 pasalubong 387146
 ph transportation 54400
 travel tax 486000
 grand total 5418904

for a lastminute flight of 3 pax i think its a pretty good deal at less than 20k per person all in few things to note

 we initially planned to do a day tour to gyeongju but skipped it though it wouldnt have cost as much either at just around 12k per pax via online sites
 we took a number of uber rides given my companions are my elderly parents
 accommodation was good for 3 pax so we had limited possibly more expensive options averaging at around 18k per night with breakfast
 no visa cost included anymore as we got a multipleentry visa early last year
 autumn foliage wasnt peaking yet at busan though i heard it was at peak in seoul and in other areas

will definitely try other korea flights and destinations next 3

daegu,recommendations for 25 weeks in sk,"looking for opinions and recs on the below itinerary for mid october to early november anything were missing anything to avoid 

we havent included jeju island even though it looks lovely as it seems too tricky without hiring a car and we dont have international drivers licenses is that the right choice 

how does a budget of 200usd per day sound for two people including all accommodation and internal travel way too low or manageable neither of us are big shoppers

we are interested in history and culture wildlife vegan food we know this will be tricky we are walkers rather than trekkers and prefer pubs to clubs 

thanks in advance

daegu,which places should i visit in korea,"hello

  
i am staying in korea for 67 months as an exchange student in a city 12 hours away from seoul id like to see as much of korea as i can while im here but there are so many cities so im not sure which ones to visit during the semester i can unfortunately only stay 23 days on the weekend in other cities because i have classes

  
i like big beautiful cities with busy streets and skyscrapers walking aimlessly interesting cafes good food but id also like to get to know korea more deeply and maybe also see more of its sceneries outside of the cities seoul felt really touristy to me i also like to travel alone

  
i have considered visiting these places so far

busan  daytrip to gyeongju

maybe daegudaejeongwangju ive heard theyre boring but it might be cool to see an ordinary city in korea

jeju island 

places close to seoul such as songdo nami island

seoraksan

gangneung or yeosu

maybe jeonju"

daegu,itinerary suggests for oct honeymoon,"hey guys 

been reading through the sub and enjoying the options and specific suggestions 

hubby  i will be traveling to sk after the holidays in october and have planned

day 1 arrive  incheon head to seoul for hotel check in 

day 2 castle visit  shopping destination sunset  han river  

day 3 lotte worlddaytripnight tour

day 4 head to ulsan river tour

day 5 game day

day 6 head to gumi where i did an abroad stay long ago then daegu for spa day relaxing

day 7 stay one more day or head back to seoul

day 8 wake up gather things and head back to incheon

asking for suggestions for

 day 2 we would like do some shopping in seoul and we were looking for midhigh end areas to shop im personally looking for seoul korean labels and brands for leather bags and clothes im aware hongdae and dongdaemunnamdaemun area are shopping meccas but would they be better over say the shinsenlotte malls hubby loves to shop too so suggestions for areas with mens and womens goods are appreciated 

 car rental hubby is an avid car enthusiast and is eager to try out a korean sports car at some point during our trip were aware the majority of our travel will probably be on public transport which is easy and inexpensive to navigate and use but he would love to try to find something for at least a couple of days he would prefer to rent something to drive while were in either ulsan or daegu area were aware hertz is an option but we would like to see if any other options are available for a more interesting choice of cars 

if there are any other suggestions for a couple on their honeymoon in these areas we would love to get them its been 15 years since i was last in sk so im looking forward to sharing my parents homeland with my husband "
daegu,how did you survive global korea scholarship financially,the monthly allowance is about 1 million won and rent is not covered by the scholarship either i have no fantasies about this being enough to live off of im just curious about peoples experiences with gks 
daegu,just an opinion about the talk of opening or not opening the state,"i have seen a lot of discussions about should the state open or not and some of the posts im seeing made me want to post something which i dont normally do so let me start with im active duty military and had the opportunity to see the daegu south korea case explode first hand as i was at camp henry the first case in daegu was the 31st in south korea and they were identified on the 18th of feb this was the first case in daegu but within 10 days that number exploded to the thousands the bases closed almost instantly and restricted all travel for military and the restrictions are still in place the city is just starting to open things but its still a ghost town if you want to see a break down of events go here httpsenwikipediaorgwiki2020coronaviruspandemicinsouthkorea20januarye2809317februaryhttpsenwikipediaorgwiki2020coronaviruspandemicinsouthkorea20januarye2809317february 

what i want to say is to those people that say its my choice to go out and open up the state its not just you you have to think about more than just you you need to think about everyone around you from friends family to people you dont even know because it only took one person to go out and cause an explosion in cases

edit thank you all for the discussions and all the upvotes plus my first ever silver"
daegu,where to visit outside of seoul and busan,"im heading to korea next week for my second trip and have a week booked in seoul as i could only spend 4 days there on my first trip after that week id like to spend about 5 days somewhere else and have a quiet week just living in a korean city or larger town im travelling for 6 months so somewhere i can recharge

ive already been to busan so not there im not really interested in history or art i prefer good food and cafes nature and just generally nice areas to wander i had considered daegu which seems to have a lot of mixed reviews and gyeongju  which sounds nice but sounds very focussed on history im happy to go there if it has a good restaurant  cafe scene but am not so interested if its only historical sites 

if anyone has any recommendations id really appreciate it  "
daegu,why are train workers on strike an explanation from a guy who really like trains,"korail is on strike right now and it has led to numerous cancellation in trains

things are more interesting to look at when you know what the strike is about so short explanation i guess

x200b

workers union demands are better pay better worker rotation and allowing ktx to depart from suseo station

the last demand is the main reason for the strike and what got the attention of all the rail fans in korea

suseo station opened in 2016 with the start of srt and start of competition between korail and srcompany responsible for running srt

previously all trains were managed by korail sr was created with huge government support because korail wasnt pulling enough dough thing is all lower class trains except for ktx arent profitable but korail cant just cancel their trains or mark the prices up for lower class trains because that would basically cut off some people in society from traveling government subsides will keep korail from going out of bushiness but they cannot rely on it forever

seeing this korail decided to increase their ktx price instead this opened up whole new problems now some people in the government got thinking

so we open a new rail company that exclusively run high speed trains so korail has some competition and theyll keep their prices downignore the fact that korail is forced to allocate income ktx is making to lower class trains

this may have worked if sr wasnt super dependent on korail

x200b

relationship between korail and sr

korail and sr are technically in competition but korail owns 41 of sr

sr runs srt but majority of srt are pulled from ktx trains that korail had and rebranded to srt theyre on a long term lease but the price korail is charging for the lease is absurdly cheap

sr has exclusive rights to use suseo station meaning they soak up all the demands from southeast regions of seoulincluding gangnam and east regions of gyeonggi

and the deal korail and sr made says in case theres an accident and srts are unable to perform normal operations korail has to cover for us using their ktx

so yeah in competition

x200b

so why is ktx trying to get into suseo and is this worth a strike

suseobusan high speed line is a major cash cow in korean trains sr while still has a significant amount of debt is pulling in steady profit from these lines while korails debt is getting higher and higher

last year powerline near suseo station experinced a failure making few srt train inoperable bound by an agreement ktx trains pulled into suseo station korean rail community got loads of pictures on that day however this brought the debate on why is korail covering for srs issues and why cant we run both ktx and srt from suseo all the time

few months later sr announced theyll be operating independently from korail korail responded to this by so if youre really independent you know all the trains youve borrowed from us we want them back then sr backed down by saying were making more trains so were using your trains until theyre finished

but what really set the strike going was expansion of srs network srt trains increased their coverage to new lines but remember they only have limited number of trains this raised some eyebrows as that means less srt trains will be running on high demand route and those routes always get sold out 23 days before departure during peak hours sr responded to this saying there will be no change in train schedule

in reality they kept the schedule same but slashed the trains in half srt during peak hours run as multi trains meaning two different trains will be joined by couplers so theyll act as one train but have twice the capacity sr basically took out half of their multi trains and run them as single trains and get the remaining trains to the new line

immediately frequent users of trains didnt like what the sr was doing daegu and busan which majority of these trains go to didnt like this either rail union saw this and thought nows the chance their logic does make sense though if sr is running less frequently from suseo station let ktx fill the gaps and korail will be able to fix the debt problem by profits from suseo

so yeah thats where we are"

daegu,10 day trip review  spend less time in seoul and more time everywhere else,"my partner and i traveled from australia to korea from the 14th to the 23rd of march we both love good food fun snacks nature especially cute animals history walking and biking our overall impression is that seoul isnt the best place to explore those interests and we would have been much better off slimming our itinerary down in order to spend time in the rest of the country im going through our itinerary again and choosing things from each day that we would recommend for people with similar interests to us along with things to discard 

tldr we enjoyed n seoul tower namsangol hanok village hongdae lotte world mall gyeongbokgung palacenational palace museum of korea and naksan park


140324
landed in incheon and took the arex to the stay classic hotel myeongdong we got a great deal for around krw 110000 per night for 5 nights no complaints here its a typical 4star hotel 

the next morning 150324 we went to namdaemun market and enjoyed kalguksu alley before walking to myeongdong lotte department store we didnt end up buying anything except for some korean foundation prices are pretty similar to what youd find in australia the funnest thing was actually hunting around the streets for popup stores

afterwards we walked to the base of n seoul tower even though everything still looked dead from winter it was a nice view try to come on a clear day or when theres particularly nice foliage 

after that we took the cable car down the mountain and walked to namsangol hanok village which is surprisingly free tbh pretty cool place with plenty of translations for westerners 

next we went to korea house for dinner this was by far the most disappointing part of our trip we got the hotel to book a reservation for dinner and a seat at the performance we wanted to book the 77000 wonperson dinner but they insisted we book 200000 wonperson with a 50 deposit they gave us a 5 course meal but the portions were so small that we were still hungry at the end plus everything was so bland we eventually asked when the performance was but they said there wasnt one and blamed the hotel for not communicating with them properly even if this is true i still strongly recommend against this place because again the food sucked and they immediately put us on the most expensive course and bafflingly needed a 50 deposit even though no one else was there that night

afterwards we walked along myeongdong walking street and bought a few things at the olive young but i didnt really enjoy any of the street foods we tried we ate a late dinner at city hof chicken 1992 and it was probably the best fried chicken we tried during our trip 

places to visit n seoul tower and namsangol hanok village


on day 3 160324 we went to jfeel dermatology in hongdae i like that they took the time to listen to my concerns with my budget and recommend facial treatments that worked well for me 

we grabbed lunch at saemaul and it was probably the best meal we got in seoul afterwards we walked to samoyed cafe winters village and let me tell you this was so cute some of the people including me got totally ignored by the dogs and some people got crashtackled by them not really sure why but i guess cover yourself in bbq sauce or something before you come here lol 

afterwards i went to the days hair salon to cut and bleach my hair while my partner went to cookin nanta no complaints from either of us

we went to hongdae walking street afterwards and ate at noo na hol dak oven chicken and beer which was easily the worst fried chicken we had in korea 

places to visit hongdae was very fun id recommend spending a full day here if youre into kbeauty and samoyeds


on day 4 170324 we hired ttareungi bikes to ride around ill cautiously recommend ttareungi with some big caveats its great for saving time in places like jamsil and myeongdong  the other places we visited didnt have good bike paths  but overall youll probably still waste time because the app is so dodgy id recommend kakao maps for directions its good at sticking to bike paths and taking you to a bike rack so you can drop off your bike and walk to your destination 

we first hired the bikes to ride around seoul forest park the insect sanctuary and the deer sanctuary were pretty cool even though you couldnt get too close the butterfly sanctuary is closed until may i would recommend visiting this place then

next we traveled to lotte world mall for some cafes london bagel museum was overpriced and overrated dont wait 2 hours for this place like we did otoh aqua garden cafe was really cool we only got two drinks there but really enjoyed the fish we also found a fun pepsi x 711 popup

finally we went to coex starfield mall the hyundai department store and bongeunsa temple but didnt buy anything or see anything too exciting 

places to visit seoul forest park after late spring lotte world mall for some cafe hopping


day 5 180324 started with a morning trip to gyeongbokgung palace for a tour and the national palace museum of korea the guard changing ceremony was pretty cool and the museum was decent we spent a good 4 hours here 

we then bikedwalked over to bukchon hanok village and tea therapy cafe i would give this whole area a miss if youre planning to go somewhere like gyeongju

we went down to gaesong traditional dumpling house in insadong tasted pretty bland one of the insadong street vendors sold us dragons beard candy which gave my partner an allergic reaction even though we asked him via google translate whether it contained any nuts we bikedwalked to naksan park for the sunset but i would definitely recommend bussing it

finally we walked to gwangjang market i dont know if its just because we went on a monday night but this was another big disappointment most vendors were selling the same foods and it seemed expensive if you desperately want to go try another time and day for our last meal in seoul we went to soybean bone charcoal bone gamjatang bukchang around the corner from our hotel it wasnt that tasty but the aunties running the place were so sweet it made up for it

places to visit gyeongbokgung palacenational palace museum and naksan park though it you have to choose between naksan park and n seoul tower go with n seoul tower


overall if youve already visited a lot of other asian metropolises seoul probably wont feel too different it might be worth it if youre a huge koreaboo or really into clubbing but i personally wasnt blown away as a comparison ill quickly go into our experiences in gyeongju and jeju and how it felt to visit them

we stayed at wiyeonjae in gyeongju for about 110000 won and although the futon beds were pretty uncomfortable it was quiet and very beautiful insideandout they also helped us rent bikes from a place just down the road this was such a breath of fresh air after the nightmare that is ttareungi we just gave them 10000 won and agreed to have them back by 6 the bikes were way more comfortable and had way more gears than the bikes in seoul too highly recommend getting around hwangnidan this way while exploring the tomb complex we walked into a random cafe called  and it was by far the best cafe food we had in korea we had dinner at a place called  which ended up being our favourite restaurant in korea the next day we bussed to bulguksa temple and seokguram grotto overall gyeongju is a mustvisit if youre interested in history it was everything we were hoping to get from seoul  feeling the romance just from walking down a random alleyway feeling like any restaurant we stumbled upon was gonna feed us the most delicious food wed ever tasted smelled a lot better too 


we then flew from daegu to jeju all the accommodation was crazy cheap and outside of peak hour traffic around the city i loved driving everywhere even though i felt a bit selfconscious as the lone driver on the island actually following the speed limit we found a lot more hidden gems in jeju like sarabong peak so many bunnies starbucks songdan park reserve and  while pretty much all the wellknown tourist attractions lived up to the hype we particularly enjoyed snoopy garden seongsan ilchulbong umutgae lookout the cheonjeyeon waterfalls and surprisingly the innisfree house we spent an entire rainy afternoon handmaking cute soap bars for each other and let me tell you the markets on jeju blow the seoul markets out of the water everyone was selling something unique there were lots of samples plenty of showmanship with the food before we came here i was worried we wasted money buying checkin luggage for the flight home but we were able to fill a suitcase with snacks and i highly recommend the squid ink salt bread from dongmun market im still drooling 


we went to the cherry blossom festival and enjoyed all the novelty festival stuff getting our caricatures done eating cherry blossom bread and icecream getting flower crowns there was absolutely no cherry blossoms blooming but on reflection im glad we came to korea when we did we had beautiful sunny weather every single day aside from one afternoon the weather forecast for the next week looks way worse i think we were extremely lucky 


overall i wish someone would have told us to cut out half of seoul and spend time in jeonju jinhae or maybe busan instead i was most excited for seoul but ended up enjoying the rest of the country way more"
daegu,travel destinations recommended by real koreans that ai doesnt know about,"this advertisement which was released through the youtube channel imagine your korea of the ministry of culture sports and tourism and the korea tourism organization focuses on things to see recommended by koreans 
a public participation promotion was carried out through a teaser advertisement with the theme of korean travel experiences recommended by real koreans that ai cannot know about 2300 comments were made to recommend places such as jeongseon mindungsan suncheon songgwangsa pohang spacewalk and gyeongju woljeonggyo and based on these various attractions across the country such as seoul jeju buyeo danyang miryang pohang damyang gochang and yeongwol were captured in the video 

the advertisements slogan is feel the   of korea and a series of visualcentered promotional videos were produced with four themes road night adventure and rest in order to reach all age groups around the world the message was minimized and intuitive visual beauty was emphasized  also    and  were written in korean and designed to match the theme to arouse the curiosity of foreigners and the korean pronunciation was written in parentheses so that they could read along 

the  section expressed the moment when the main character who missed the bus and started a walking trip discovers the hidden charm of korean roads various korean roads were used as materials including seouls seosunla road and hipjiro sunchangs yonggwolsan sky road hamyangs jiangjae pohangs spacewalk and geochangs udusan swinging bridge

the  section shows korea a dynamic and safe place full of things to enjoy at night such as the food at daegu seomun night market media art at ulsan myeongseondo gyeongju woljeonggyo and jinju namgang yudeung festival discovered by two curious female runners while running

daegu,visiting in december,"coming to south korea in coming december 17 to 30 dec tp be exact

2 adults and 2 boys 8 and 11 with 3 big size luggages check in type

question should i rent a drive ill be staying in seoul for maximum 2 to 3 days and wont be driving but the rest of the trip we are thinking of going to busan vivaldi park gyeongju ulsan daegu area and having a car with kids and big luggages just feel more convenient but ive never driven in winter season before and not sure about traffic outside of seoul as well

also is it hard to drive from seoul to vivaldi park

is it worth the risk thanks in advance"
daegu,suggestionsopinions on itinerary,"currently planning our first trip to south korea and would love some feedbacksuggestions before we lock in our flights and accomodation

my husband and i will be travelling with our 3yo this is our first overseas trip as a family which is probably why were having a bit of a hard time locking in our itinerary

 seoul staying near namdaemun 2127 october

 fly to jeju staying on the northern part of the island 2731 october

 fly to busan staying near haeundae beach 31 october  3 november

 ktx to seoul staying near gangnam district 35 november

 incheon staying near the airport 56 november

for the most part im happy with these locations but ive gone back and forth between including jeju in this trip or swapping it for another location ideally wed love to arrange a second trip at some point but that would likely be during warmer months

jeju looks beautiful in fall and our son loves the beach i read somewhere that it might still be warm enough for a swim in the ocean but im not sure how accurate that info is
it also means adding in the internal flights tofrom the mainland and hiring a car to visit all the places we want to see we arent opposed to this but would love some feedback about whether its worth it to be spend 4 nights on jeju vs swapping it for another location on the mainland like sokcho daejeon or daegu before continuing onto busan

for further context we live in northern western australia originally from perth so weve never experienced stereotypical fall weather with the changing leaves this is what im most excited for and what has been one of the main factors when choosing locations with that in mind please give us some suggestions andor feedback "
daegu,buying bus tickets at the machine in advance ,"plzzzzzz does anyone know if its possible to buy  tickets in advance from the intercity bus ticket machines 
i need to travel from haeundae to daegu a few months ago i arrived at the station at noon to buy a ticket but they were sold out so i had to wait for two hours 
this time since i need to take the earliest bus im worried the same thing will happen 
i want to buy the ticket a day or two in advance from the ticket machine does anyone know if this is possible its really inconvenient that foreigners cant buy tickets online"
daegu,busanpohangseoul,"hello we will be travelling to seoulbusan pohang then back to seoul next month can you suggest me an efficient route to go about this 

1 seoul to busan has no issues since we are planning to take the ktx

1 suggestion from friends include taking a bus from busan to pohang but i checked httpswwwkobuscokrmrsrotinfdohttpswwwkobuscokrmrsrotinfdo theres no busan  pohang route there can you point me to another website where we can reserve our tickets the tmoney go app doesnt have an eng trans so i am relying heavily on papago to figure out the routes but if you can suggest another foreignerfriendly app that i can use itd be such a relief and if you can share with me the bus schedules so that we can effectively plan our itinerary we will be doing a day tour and then go back to seoul at the last possible trip out

2 pohang  seoul is another thing our choices are to take the train to daegu then transfer to another train to seoul another option is via bus but i have no idea what is the schedule for pohangseoul buses if you have any information kindly share them with me hehe 

thank you so much d"

daegu,coming to ulsan ,just have a couple questions ive got a pretty good travel plan for the day time just wondering what the night life was like where to go how they treat foreigners if it matters im an american military man i went to busan an experienced a pretty racist taxi driver im white other than that one experience i had an amazing time i know in daegu they dont let foreigners into certain placesclubsbars is it the same 
daegu,10 day itinerary ,"hi

i was planning to visit south korea for 1014 days ive been to seoul before for a few days and will be headed there again for a work trip later in the year thus i was thinking about the following 

 head straight from icn and spend 5 nights in busan
 start heading back to seoul by stopping for a night or two in gyeonju
 maybe a night in daegudaejeon

i mainly plan to travel by either the regular train or bullet trains as ive heard they are quite fantastic any suggestions on where to stay in busanseoul and some must try south korean foodcocktails would be highly appreciated 

i would love to visit any cities which offer good hiking trails or a national park seoraksan but i suspect i would need to rent a car and that might be too hectic

thanks all in advance"
daegu,seoul is cool and allbut,"so seoul is cool and allactually i dont even like seoul its one of my least favorite cities however there are other very cool cities to consider

busan

honestly busan is amazing you got the beach you got a great night life lots of stuff to do some of the cooler aquariums ive ever been too and you got an airport which makes it super easy to travel around asia

you also got a virbant expat community you got a small dash of us soldiers lots of sailors and of course your generic mix of english teachers

honestly busan is fucking awesome

daegu

daegu is in a great position its very easy to get to seoul or busan its subway system is pretty easy to navigate downtown is pretty centralized and the winters are super mild

your 2 hours from seoul and 45 minutes from busan also daegu has an airport although smaller then busan

pohang

pohang has that small town feel but its not completely a small town its a population of about 500k getting into the country is easy and just north of pohang is a lot of cool beaches

daejon

its a bit smaller then daegu but its closer to seoul without actually being seoul they have their own ktx station so its super easy to get in and around korea ive only been up here a few times but always had a good time and felt like my dollar went furthur 

they also got a big wine thing every single year

in all of those cities you will find foreign friendly bars western food and so forth also the prices are significantly lower in those cities meaning your money will go furthur plus the pay can be better in those cities you see schools in seoul know you want to be therewhy should they pay you but schools in some of the smaller cities need to offer more competitive packages to get your employment

seoul is not end all be all so many think it is in fact ive been in korea for a decadeand ive been to seoul a handful of times maybe 5 or 6 times in fact there are years where i dont even step foot in seoul"
daegu,travelling in south korea during chuseok,"hello everyone  
i just found out about how busy is travelling in south korea during chuseok we are supposed to go from seoul to busan on saturday 14th but i guess well go by plane still very affordable prices



then we will stay in busan on 15th 16th and 17th sept and planning to rent a car early morning on the 18th last day of chuseok in busan and drive to gyeongiu do you think we will find lots of traffic as per naver it should be less than 2 hours driving on a regular day



the original plan was to rent the car on 16th late morning in busan and drive to andong and daegu but am afraid of traffic jam during chuseok how bad can it be in those areas

many thanks in advance"
daegu,haeinsa temple,im travelling from seoul to busan in august with ktx and want to make a stop in daegu to visit the haeinsa temple i saw that its possible to take a bus from daegu to haeinsa but i cannot find any timetables is it feasible to visit the temple complex if  i have the whole day to make it to busan does anyone have any recommendationstips to make this trip
daegu,half a day in incheon and other day trips,im travelling to seoul on august 12th and arriving at 440am i have 5 1 at the end of my trip days dedicated to seoul and 1 of those is for a tour of the dmz is it worth spending the morning in incheon before making my way to seoul a whole day or no time at all and should i spend the rest of those days in seoul or should i venture somewhere else for a halffull day i also have 11 currently flexible days between the cities of daejeon jeonju gwangju busan and gyeongju before im taking a flight to jeju and 4 not as flexible days in daegu and sokcho
daegu,11 days in korea which cities should i pick,"i will have 115 days in korea with my mom 59 around marchapril i was thinking about the following itinerary

4 days  seul  
1 day  suwon day trip  
2 days  daegu  
2 days  gyeongju

2 days  busan

the questions i keep trying to answer are  
are daegu and gyeongju really worth it  
should i change it up to only include seul and busan for the whole stay or just seul busan and jeju island

i love historical sights good foods shoppping on the cheaper side nothing near luxury and sightseeing hope to catch the cherry blossoms in japan andor korea it will be probably the only time we will ever go to korea  at least together  so i wanted to make the most out of it specially because my mom is currently super addicted to historical kdramas

i appreciate any and all tipsplaces to gocities to visit  thank you

  
edit so far youve got me convinced of 5 days in seul 3 gyeongju deff including a day trip to see unesco world heritage sites and 3 days in busan including maybe a day trip to daegu in one of those who knows

thank you so much and yes im a planner and a fast pacer traveler so i like to pack my itinerary and see as much as i can haha"
daegu,4 rivers route vs east coast cycle routes  south korea,"hi guys

my best friend is visiting from australia and i am looking for a multi day bike trail through korea i am stuck between the 2 cycle routes and would love to hear your opinions

someone once told me the 4 rivers trail can get a little monotonous and boring after chungju and the east coast route can be a lot less busy especially during summer

has there been anyone who has completed the these routes before if so which one would you recommend and why for a first time traveller here

thanks so much guys i really appreciate your advice

update

thanks for all the information it really helped me plan my trip

so we will be cycling from august i will be meeting my mates in seoul from jeju

we will be cycling the 4 rivers but i have adjusted the route with kamoot to go through andong yeongdeok pohang and gyeongju  instead of through daegu

thanks everyone for your help

daegu,family trip 14 days leaving in 3 weeks,"hello all
new to reddit but ive heard its a great source of travel advice so please dont prove me wrong

have two weeks in korea and have sort of worked out what we want to do but looking for advicesuggestions or corrections

we are a family that travels regularly and our kids are 1210 been to japan few time but not korea

likely will dedicate 7 days to seoul and day trips five at the beginning and two at the end

for the other week thinking 34 days around gyeongju and 23 days around jeonju

decided at this stage to skip busan and jeju

for gyeongju would you just stay there or split time with daegu or andong

as far as transport train from seoul to gyeongju carbus to jeonju and then train back

tia"
daegu,news youll be happy with a trip to korea that becomes more convenient,"


1 kculture training visa kculture training visa which allows foreigners who receive training in the fields of kpop training kpop choreography fashion models and advertising models to stay in korea for a long time will be piloted from september 2024 in the meantime there was an inconvenience of having to return to the home country every few months and get a visa again but this was improved

4 expansion of local direct flights and extension of cruise passengers stay it is also decided to expand direct flights between local airports such as cheongju daegu and busan and overseas cities busanjacarta and cheongjubali routes will be established in the second half of the year and the number of daeguulan bator routes will increase consultations will also be made with countries such as the philippines which are in high demand for visiting korea to establish and increase transportation rights in order to increase the tourist stay time of cruise tourists an additional unmanned automatic screening station will be installed and the operating hours of cruise passenger terminals such as busan port will be extended by one to two hours more when requested for shipping companies

daegu,korea  japan travel suggestions need your opinion on the following places,"hi all ive spent much of the past 23 years in taiwan 20202022 and se asia 20222023 the latter which included 3 months in malaysia and a year in bangkok on an ed visa i also stayed for a month in the philippines only manila and northern luzon while vietnam and some other places are on my list my next trip i am thinking of seeing more of japan last time i went was 2019 or south korea never been

ill start off with sk since itll be my first time if i choose to go there obviously theres seoul but im also interested in jeju island and maybe another city like busan or daegu which of these places would you recommend i start with and how long should i spend in each of these places probably cant do all of them as part of my itinerary is south korea expensive overall

with japan i didnt make it to tokyo last time i only briefly managed to see osaka and kyoto since i love the sea and especially marine life id be interested in the izu and ogasawara islands or maybe wakayama  kushimoto kagoshima and the ryukyus i could also go further north to hokkaido

this is just a very rough idea of places im interested in and would appreciate your opinions and suggestions"
daegu,bes way to get from incheon to daegu,"im taking a group of people to daegu where i used to live in april  we have everything sorted out for our stay in daegu but not for our travel from the airport to daegu

what is the bestmost efficient or cost effective way to get from the airport to daegu  its been a long time since ive been in korea  ktx bus slow train what are the pros and cons"
daegu,requesting a school transfer in daegu,"daegu has a rule where nets must change schools every 4 years no exceptions and transfers are usually reserved for teachers working a 2nd or 3rd year at the same schools while this is my 5th year working for the dmoe its my 1st year at the new schools how likely would it be that i would be granted a transfer has anyone requested a transfer after one year and was approved i have a unique conflict in school schedules that i dont think i can keep up for another year

x200b

my travel schools and main schools vacation schedules dont match up because the travel school is a specialized school where students only have 1 week of summer vacation while my main school has the regular 1 month i only teach at the travel school once a week and wanted to use 2 of my vacation days to cover the two wednesdays that that i teach at the travel school however the head teacher at the travel school didnt allow me to use my vacation days as those are that schools working days so  i ended up only being able to take only 1 full week of summer vacation instead of 3 weeks i was planning to take  

anyone else had a school conflict or school schedule conflict that allowed you to transfer earlier"
daegu,cities to visit with korail pass,"hey there
my friend and i will be in seoul from mid march until mid april we are planning to get a korail pass to travel around a bit as we would otgerwise be staying in seoul the whole time we were thinking a consecutive pass for 3 or 4 days to go to gyeongju stay the night and go to busan the next day and back to seoul 
apart from that we would like to plan one or two day trips to other cities as well i was thinking gangneung and sokcho as one
however we dont want to spend another night anywhere else just go there in the morning and come back in the evening
do you have any recommended cities to daytrip to what about daegu jeonju daejeon gwangju anywhere you can get to easily by train and to do some cultural historic or artsy stuff we also love nature so any recommendations are much appreciated
thank you"
daegu,gyeongju daytrip or overnight,"im planning a visit to gyeongju and wondering whether its worth staying overnight or if a day trip from daegu or busan would be sufficient any recommendations or experiences

well be traveling with two suitcases and im looking to avoid dealing with luggage on bus trips or is it feasible to leave our suitcases at a hotel in daegubusan and pick them up a day later after coming back from gyeongju "
daegu,do you think theres a possibility that the mots7 world tour might get cancelled due to the increased coronavirus outbreak,"recently theres been an increasing amount of cases of the coronavirus around the world bts has had one of their concerts that they were on the lineup on for in daegu cancelled or pushed back because of the outbreak of cases in specifically daegu their recent press conference for mots7 was without a live audience or press due to fears of gathering of large amounts of people in one area which allows for the possibility of spreading the virus now theyve also just announced that promotions and live stage performances for mots7 on korean music shows will also be without a live audience due to the same fears and concerns 

is it a possibility now that they may also either cancelled or delay the world tour being that theyre starting it off in april in korea which is now the second most infected country outside of china"
daegu,canon m50 lens for travel,"hi all i work for an airline and i have a canon m50 thats been collecting dust for quite sometime now im doing multiple international trips this year with multiple to korea i usually fly to hawaii and want to take up some photography i know the system is dead but when i bought the camera i picked up quite a few lenses already and have the following 
 
sigma efm 16mm f14
canon efs 24mm f28 with adapter 
viltrox 33mm f14
canon 1545mm f3563
canon 50mm f18
canon 1855mm f3556

im not really planning on buying into the new r system and since im very very much a beginner and want to just get into it i think what i have is more than enough however i do want and am thinking about picking up the canon 22mm f2 but am debating on the 1122mm f456 i can easily purchase the 22mm it seems for 200 and i see some good and excellent condition 1122mm for around 220270 

in your opinion since i want to travel light would you recommend at all to purchase either one of these lenses or if its even worth it the trip coming up is going to be in korea for two weeks ill be visiting seoul obviously lol but also daegu busan and daejeon with a korean girl whos been teaching me korean street temples parks etc

thank you so much for any help or advice in advance please go easy on me im new lol

daegu,and yet another itinerary check post first time in korea going for 3 weeks,"hey everyone so i 24f am currently planning for my first trip to korea in june for context i and my sisters who are coming with me are koreanamerican but we do not speak any korean i can understand a decent amount and can read very slowly but they only speak english my dad who should be with us for most of our stops does speak korean conversationally were going to be staying with my grandparents in seoul but hotels for busan and jeju have not been booked yet we do plan to rent a car in jeju originally we were planning to go straight to jeju from busan but my grandparents are going to be coming with us and it might be too much at once for them so thats why we split up those cities

we are going to be visiting family in daegu so if there is anything interesting or fun we should check out while we are there we would love to her it as well

edit we will driving a personal car from seoul  daegu  busan  seoul i will be taking the train from busan  daejeon by myself for my tattoo and then again from daegeon  seoul if my family wants to sit daejeon out and just drive home from busan

i am debating adding a day at daejeon if there is anything cool for everyone to see there on our way back from busan to seoul as i have a particular tattoo artist in mind whose shop is located in daejeon if its not worth having everyone stop at daejeon though i am probably going to take the train from busan to daejeon to seoul by myself while everyone else drives straight home to seoul for a rest day before the fun starts the following again in seoul

we dont have many concrete dinner plans except for the few that are stated below and im sure we will be doing some athome dinners in seoul but if you have any musthave food suggestions i would also love to hear them

the frog boys is a group of five murdered south koreanhttpsenwikipediaorgwikisouthkorea boys who disappeared on march 26 1991 in west of daeguhttpsenwikipediaorgwikidaegu while froghunting their bodies were found 11 years later

the incident has been the subject of two films come back frog boys 1992 and childrenhttpsenwikipediaorgwikichildren2011film 2011 there are also several songs referencing the case

 the five boys were between 9 and 13 years old 

 u cheolwon aged 13
 jo hoyeon aged 12
 kim yeonggyu aged 11
 park chanin aged 10
 kim jongsik aged 9

 

march 26 1991 was a public holiday in south korea for the 1991 local electionshttpsenwikipediaorgwindexphptitlesouthkoreanlocalelections1991actioneditredlink1 the boys decided to spend the day catching frogs in the streams of mount waryong 35867n 128513ehttpstoolswmflabsorggeohackgeohackphppagenamefrogboysparams35867n128513e they never returned to their homes

after they were reported missing their story became a national sensation president roh taewoohttpsenwikipediaorgwikirohtaewoo sent 300000 police and military troops to search for the missing boys with the searches shown on live tv several of the boys parents left their jobs to travel around the country looking for their children mount waryong was searched over 500 times

on september 26 2002 a man searching for acorns discovered their bodies in the mountain an area that had been previously searched he first reported the remains via an anonymous phone call initially the police stated that they thought the boys had died of hypothermiahttpsenwikipediaorgwikihypothermia however the parents did not accept that conclusion and demanded a full investigation the families questioned the conclusion that the boys had simply died after getting lost due to the oddities of the boys clothes being found tied in knots and of their bodies being found a short distance from the village in an area the boys knew very well forensic experts found the skulls of threes showed bluntforce trauma possibly from metal tools police said its possible the children were killed by someone who may have flown into a rage

in 2006 the statute of limitationshttpsenwikipediaorgwikistatuteoflimitations expired on the case this means authorities cannot prosecute anyone for the murders the police said they will continue the investigation to get answers

daegu,nov 1945 news articles called out korean national traitors who helped japanese residents liquidate their assets in korea into cash to take back to japan even public shaming one man by name,"continuing with my ongoing exploration of the old newspaper archives from 1945 korea that i checked out at the national library of korea in september 2023 i decided to take a closer look at some more antijapanese articles in a japanese language newspaper that was published after being taken over by a group of korean independence activists around november 1st 1945 korean employees overthrew their japanese bosses at gyeongseong ilbo keijo nippo the colonial era newspaper that had served as the main propaganda newspaper for the whole of colonial korea from 1909 to 1945 the korean independence activists subsequently continued the publication of this newspaper in japanese with an avowed korean nationalist editorial stance until december 11th 1945 as the korean employees of keijo nippo explained in their message to the readershttpswwwredditcomrkoreacomments16s4lfzkoreanstaffatkeijonippotookovernews this was a temporary measure undertaken while korean typefaces were being prepared for eventual use

these are a few short articles from november 1945 that give you a rough feel of what the attitudes of koreans towards the japanese were like back then there was apparently a feeling that the wealth that the japanese people amassed during the colonial period was illgotten so the editors looked on with disapproval at any attempt by the japanese to sell their things for cash to take back to japan they even viewed any korean who helped the japanese liquify their assets as traitors naming one individual in particular to publicly shame lee bokdong whose name is also written on the signage above the door in the news illustration of tanaka store there is also a report about japanese people who were attempting to illegally travel from japan into korea next to that story is a short announcement about the release of park yeolhttpsenwikipediaorgwikipakyol a korean independence activist who was jailed in japan for attempting to assassinate the emperor he is a controversial figure as his political affiliation changed many times from anarchism projapanese imperialist anticommunism after the war and then to procommunism

the intellectual class should unite with the populace

do not buy japanese property

lieutenant general hodge meets with song jinwoo

lieutenant general hodgehttpsenwikipediaorgwikijohnrhodge invited mr song jinwoohttpsenwikipediaorgwikisongjinwoojournalist leader of the korean democratic party for a discussion that lasted about an hour lieutenant general hodge addressed the korean intellectuals as follows

currently the korean populace is being misled by ruffians nihilists and projapanese factions you should all strive to enter among the masses and make them understand what nationalism and democracy really mean

i am convinced that all the people support nationalism and democracy nevertheless it is regrettable that workers are not working due to the interference of ruffians nihilists destructionists and projapanese factions

from a democratic standpoint we cannot but allow the sale and purchase of japanese property however if koreans do not unite to buy it the japanese will likely leave the property as it is when they leave yet the projapanese factions are colluding with the japanese enriching themselves

the military government does not permit japanese people to take more than one thousand yen in cash when returning to their country

if the korean intellectual class joins the masses to thoroughly disseminate nationalism and democracy and unites to demonstrate the true power of the korean people the issue of the 38th parallel which is a personal opinion of the director of the far eastern department of the state department will naturally be resolved

mr lee please take care of it dont worry

what is the relationship between tanaka store and lee bokdong   walking through the japanese shopping district one can hear such conversations in each house look at the expression of the greedy old japanese man guarding the safe in the back room his heart insisting on turning every single plate into money before leaving is the last evil vestige of forty years of exploitation however the detestable pests infesting this country are not just these greedy japanese moneykeepers

there are also plenty of traitors to the nation who ride along with them saying ill take care of your household goods and who are those buying up japanese property they too must be completely driven out illustration furniture to be sold off quickly

illegal crossings of japanese to korea

travel ban to be implemented if illegal crossings increase

while the repatriation transport of japanese has become significant conversely many japanese are attempting to travel from japan to korea these ordinary japanese people are being denied landing and detained by the allied forces authorities at busan and other korean ports

it goes without saying that japanese cannot travel freely to korea recalling the times when even we who were once called imperial subjects needed certificates to travel it is unreasonable for the japanese to think of korea as their own territory and attempt to illegally travel for an easier life there because of inconvenient circumstances in their own country enduring inconvenience and hardship should be the way for the japanese to live on this matter colonel stilwell states that under the current situation japanese are fundamentally not permitted to travel to korea

those with unavoidable circumstances must obtain permission from the allied authorities and possess a permit to travel if the number of japanese attempting to travel to korea increases in the future a ban on illegal travel in other regions will likely be issued once this ban is issued regardless of the reason travel for japanese will become more difficult therefore the japanese side is urged to fully cooperate with the intentions of the united nations

mr park yeol to be welcomed

comrades from daegu are headed to tokyo

daegu,canon m50 travel lens advice,"hi all i work for an airline and i have a canon m50 thats been collecting dust for quite sometime now im doing multiple international trips this year with multiple to korea i usually fly to hawaii and want to take up some photography i know the system is dead but when i bought the camera i picked up quite a few lenses already and have the following 
 
sigma efm 16mm f14
canon efs 24mm f28 with adapter 
viltrox 33mm f14
canon 1545mm f3563
canon 50mm f18
canon 1855mm f3556

im not really planning on buying into the new r system and since im very very much a beginner and want to just get into it i think what i have is more than enough however i do want and am thinking about picking up the canon 22mm f2 but am debating on the 1122mm f456 i can easily purchase the 22mm it seems for 200 and i see some good and excellent condition 1122mm for around 220270 

in your opinion since i want to travel light would you recommend at all to purchase either one of these lenses or if its even worth it the trip coming up is going to be in korea for two weeks ill be visiting seoul obviously lol but also daegu busan and daejeon with a korean girl whos been teaching me korean street temples parks etc

thank you so much for any help or advice in advance please go easy on me im new lol

i know theres pros and cons one does better with low light one has a wider angle etc etc since its my first time to korea im trying to decide which one would potentially get more use and experienced photographers can help guide me to making a good choice of the two my brain keeps going back and forth 

22mm standalone is small and compact

but the 1122 has wider angle

but the 22mm has better low light 

but you can argue the 1122 is more versatile im at a war with myself lol

daegu,190701  bts world experience by game reporter in his 30s,"source from this articlehttpmgameinsightcokrnewsarticleviewhtmlidxno18379

x200b

this is a review by a gaming reporter an ahjussi in his 30s who isnt familiar with the bts members    i thought it was fun to read so i tried translating it  

x200b

i hope you dont take it too seriously and enjoy reading please dont argue about the game being femalemale targeted here since thats been done many other times on other posts

x200b

x200b

bts world experience 1   first impression of the members in a man in his 30s trying very hard to not cringe review of bts raising game

x200b

the inevitable time has come

on the evening of 26th this was my thought as bts world server opened   i had flashbacks of the times i had confidently told my colleagues that i will withstand this game  my colleague reporters were already fallen from not being able to tolerate the previews before the game came out  it was up to me to do it

honestly i had confidence one time i had been exposed and survived a lot of other examples while doing research on the market targeted at female gamers  i even did a bit of prep work doing the superstar bts game  i tend to listen to idol songs regardless of gender if the songs are good  i pressed play  bts my friends since im the manager youre gonna have a full schedule

bts world is a cinematic simulation game of upbringing collecting and exchange  in the play the story takes a large portion and the data volume of the game is beyond imagination

the play is similar to chinese female oriented dating simulations love and producer by paper games  to share phone calls text and communicate by sns as well as to clear missions with card levels  in conclusion you need powers of fighting against the evils of cringe  although the manager that keeps trying to cross the line made me a bit nervous i tried to pick the most rational choices and build my affinity

i thought i would be able to withstand it but it wasnt easy  the beginning was especially a bit of a crisis  why do we get one liners on a shiny background of things like copper tanned skin charismatic eyes or skin like white jade  in addition these are not even about fictional characters but of people who actually exist

writing this while squirming and wailing

x200b

while playing this game i focused on the game system as much as possible and regained my calm  im just a gamer that is raising up fictional characters  2012 is just another universe that the protagonist fell in  its just another possible past of the 14 million pasts that dr strange saw  selfhypnosis with these thoughts gave me peace

i had noticed it while playing superstarbts as well but its not easy to tell people apart when theyre all styled like an album cover  many men dont really pay attention to faces of other men  it was my first  hurdle to become an army  army will know who they are even by looking at their shadows  as if to say this there were a lot of ux design that didnt tell me the name of the character  as a beginner i had no choice but to learn them

finally after learning the faces and characters of the bts members im writing down the initial impressions of the 7 members  these are just personal impression  im up to chapter 5 of the story

jin  he seems like a protagonist in a romantic comedy  with elegant impression and figure he is an ideal of a handsome man  there are not many things in the world that men hate as much as actual handsome men saying theyre handsome all the time  but whenever he opens his mouth there is something not quite all there about him  this must be his unexpected charms  he was so unexpectedly funny that i ended up actually laughing out loud a number of times  his character as the luxury version of the common neighborhood hyung is quite unique as well

suga  he seems to be the tsendere rule enforcer  during another story the genre suddenly changes into beethoven virus kdrama  he becomes suddenly the most serious person in the world when music comes up as a topic  did they say a man who has focus on his work is sexy  he seemed to hate bangtan sonyeondan group name the most i understand him  if you think hes a bit too sensitive he shows his caring side while pretending to be not caring  it felt like a female heroine from a typical maletargeted game had gotten swept in a storm and fell into a typical femaletargeted game

jhope  even when he is not in the centre of attention i could see he was always smiling  he doesnt say things that stand out too much  he has the aura of being able to mingle and get along well no matter which group he falls into  in the game he seems to be the type of subcharacter that is protagonists brother or hoobae that cheerfully leads the protagonist a few times  his cards especially seem to have poses that express im cute

rm  he showed charisma even from the beginning of the game  if i met him in real life i would probably call him hyung  in reality anyone who seems more powerful is really the hyung  i thought he would be a sports man but it was interesting to find out he was studying creative literature  i also felt camaraderie when he kept losing or breaking things  he seems to be good at writing and is very logical  i would like to nominate him as potential winner if there were a keyboard battle contest

jimin  when i first saw bts i thought he was the youngest  he is cute and i really like his eyes  he appears as the grandson of a rice cake business and i think he would have fit well even if he really went into that business  i was surprised he had good acting in the another story  he seems to be the type that does everything well when given the chance  he was so attractive when he was wanting food it made me want to buy him a meal  his reactions are always good so teasing him seemed most satisfying  if i could have one of them as a younger brother i would choose jimin

v  i really dont know  i cant define his character no even his mental world is not of this world  the speech does not go in introbuild upclimaxresolution but introresolution  character deoni dalbi in a book by lee youngdo had this type of speech and i didnt know i would meet such person in real life  if i were to live with someone like this life would never be boring  of course life would also never be peaceful but   when he wrote the lyrics glassmentality boy i liked his artistic emotions

jungkook  hes the youngest and he really does act like the youngest  the conversation images seemed to have been made to be especially cute  unlike jimin i feel like he would be hurt if i tease him so i cant tease him  initially he seemed like a kid who wanted to be mature but later on i could see a bit of that maturity as the character seemed to grow his image in the cards at times were so different that sometimes i could not recognize him  when hes smiling sometimes hes difficult to distinguish from jhope  he suddenly seems very dependable when he starts singing

x200b

x200b

time travel to 2012 is a bit of a cliche premise  the fact that we know they become world stars neutralizes the limits of idols in reality  as the protagonist already knows the future the player can focus on the details of each step as they naturally reach that point along the way

even now i have each members profile up beside me as im working hard on this game  ive even found an error in the process v is from daegu but when he goes to the countryside he uses jeolla satoori  but outside of that i can see that they put in a lot of effort to be consistent with many things about bts  and it was interesting to play another story of what may have happened to the members if they did not become bts

the flower thats used to level up the cards is smeraldo and its a flower that doesnt exist created by bighit to sound like it existed to be used as hints in bts worldand many other tmis have been absorbed into my brain now  i might have to join army fanclub in order to finish this game

x200b

the game ost heartbeat was a very nice song to listen to  and the mv cinematography wasnt cringy either  it looked like they put in a lot of effort and looks like a scene from a drama  the acting by members look natural too  the talk bubbles were the only part that was a bit difficult to watch

bts world exploration has just started for me  since ive survived the trials and tribulations of adjusting to the game i will play this as far as i can  next article youll be able to see an ajussi manager in his 30s training the bts  the fact that it feels like im the one being trained rather than btssurely is just my imagination"

 fc seoul won their playoff against k league 2s busan ipark  
 seongnam fc were promoted from k league 2  
 ulsan won their champions league playoff and are in the group stages

its impossible to write a concise summary of the 2018 season  you can get some of the details from the club guide below  but one of the most interesting stories actually comes from k league 2

for context you need to understand a bit about military service for footballers rather than take 2 years out of their career to serve in the military or do some kind of eg desk job service players can join one of two military football teams that play in the k league in k league 1 there is sangju sangmu and in k league 2 there is asan mugunghwa every player in these two teams is on loan for two years from another club in the k league sangju sangu is affiliated with the normal military whilst asan mugunghwa is affiliated with the police serving in the auxilliary police force is another way to do your service

the korean government recently decided to abolish the auxilliary police force by 2023 the police however decided to already wind down their sports teams putting an immediate halt on recruiting players and disbanding the teams in 2019

now the champions of k league 2 last season were asan mugunghwa they were in line for direct promotion to k league 1 to compete in the k league you need to have at least 20 players but by the time the next season started asan would only have 14 players as the loan deals ran out the league gave asan a deadline in november to submit a recruitment plan which they failed to do and so the promotion spot passed to secondplaced seongnam fc although that deadline and hence promotion was missed asan have how submitted a recruitment plan that would see their 14 serving players be supplemented by new signings that indicates the club will transition to an cityowned club with the help of the asan government

funnily or depressingly this is not the first time police fc won k league 2 and missed out on promotion  in 2016 ansan mugunghwa were crowned champions but at the end of that year moved from ansan to asan in line with the leagues policies they were registered as a brand new club

k league 1 club guide

clubs can have up to three foreign players in their squad plus an extra one from another afc nation although rare a player with north korea citizenship is not considered foreign most of those foreign places are taken by brazilians or players from the former yugoslavia eg k league veteran dejan damjanovic the exception to the foreigner rule is the goalkeeper  korean goalkeepers in the 90s were just so bad that a block on recruiting foreign goalieshttpwwwkleagueunitedcom201703foreigngoalkeepersinfavourofhtml was put in place to help encourage development of domestic talent it seems to have worked with korean goalkeepers often being signed abroad in asia at least

there is also a requirement to have u23 players fielded and on the bench with a failure to meet this impacting the number of substitutes that can be made article 30httpswwwkleaguecomaboutcompetition of the league rules

youll notice some of the clubs have a korean chaebol in their team name and even if its not in the name they may still be owned by a corporation behind the scenes this sounds very odd if youre not familiar with it but it is extremely common in japan china and korea it may just be a symptom of some of the teams being relatively recentlyfounded and perhaps isnt that unusual these days think red bull city group majority shareholders in the west however the number of citizen clubs owned by the local city or provincial government is on the rise  gyeongnam fc is one example

a lot of clubs probably like to think they have a derby with fc seoul because well its seoul but the  biggest and probably considered the national derby is the super match  between fc seoul and suwon samsung bluewings montenegrin damjanovic known simply as dejan formerly of seoul and now playing for suwon is the top scorer in this fixture

heres the clubs by last seasons standing and since crests are a bit unstable on reddit at the moment heres an imgur album of all club crests and corresponding home kits for the 2019 seasonhttpimgurcomaw8dbla5

jeonbuk hyundai motors

jeonbuk are the dominant team in korea and one the of the teams you dont want to face in the champions league whoever you are theyve now won 4 out of the last 5 k league 1 titles and a most recent champions league title in 2016

their rise to power over the last decade has been overseen by long term manager choi kanghee choi left at the end of last season to tianjin quanjintianhai daliang yifang fc in china korea seems to have a thing for portuguese managers these days and his replacement is one jos morais morais was assistant manager to jos mourinho for a period but as manager proper hes been a bit shit he was at two clubs in 2018 which included ushering barnsley into relegation to english league one how jeonbuk will fare after choi remains to be seen

although jeonbuk cruised to the league title it would be difficult to call their season an outright success due to a horrendous 15 mins at the end of the second half in a home match against suwon in the champions league quarterfinal they turned the 3 goal deficit around in the seond leg when they travelled to suwon but went out on penalties 

gyeongnam fc

gyeongnam were only promoted from k league 2 the previous season so coming second in k league 1 is something special top scorer in the league marco played his part with 26 goals

gyeongnam will now feature in the champions league for the first time i thought that seems to have put the brakes on too many of their players departing but captain choi youngjun signed for jeonbuk in the winter transfer window a major loss is marco who was also top scorer in k league 2 in the year they were promoted who appears to have followed the money to china also off to china is key centreback park jisoo so basically the backbone of the team from defence to attack has left

ulsan hyundai

known as the horangi   the tigers  ulsan have had intermittent success in asia winning the champions league for the first and only time in 2012 in an unbeaten run

towards the end of the 2018 season ulsan were battling gyeongnam for the second spot which brings with it direct qualification to the champions league group stages rather than having a playoff they lost out but were widely expected to secure a direct qualification spot anyway when they faced daegu fc in the fa cup final ultimately they finished the season on a low losing 51 on aggregate to daegu in the final 

pohang steelers

one of the few clubs that predates the formation of the k league pohang are another of the historical korean powerhouses they hold the record for the most number of champions league title 3 but their last title came in 2009

finishing fourth in the league they were hoping that ulsan would beat daegu in the fa cup final to pass their champions league spot on down but it didnt happen

jeju united

one of the original members of the k league founded as the yukong elephants in the seoul area as part of the decentralisation program they moved to bucheon kind of and were renamed as bucheon sk the decision to move to jeju in 2006 was an abrupt one and understandably deeply unpopular with the fans teams uprooting and moving elsewhere is a bit of a catalyst for the creation of new teams in korea and the fans formed bucheon fc 1995 in the absence of bucheon sk

the reason given for the relocation was to the address the imbalance in football teams being located around seoulgyeonggido and jeju did not have a pro team at the time but there are suggestions the owners sk group wanted to cut their investment and recoup some costs

there were recent rumours that jeju would move yet again back north to yongin but who knows 

jeju had a pretty mediocre season what more can i say

suwon samsung bluewings

suwons 2018 season was a bit bonkers and especially so in their champions league run

in their champions league group in which they were drawn with eventual winners kashima antlers suwon did not manage a single home win however they had managed to get two away wins and going into the final match they still had their fate in their own hands if they could win against group leaders kashima in japan they won 10 getting three away wins and topping the group

manager seo jungwon at a time when suwon were 4th in the league resigned the day before the first leg of their champions league quarterfinal clash with jeonbuk due to fan protests jeonbuk were apparently completely bamboozled by this event and took a 30 beating at home then in the return leg in suwon jeonbuk fought back to win 30 but suwon were able to scrape through on penalties to face kashima antlers yet again in the semis

in the semifinal fixture suwon went 20 up against kashima antlers inside the first 10 minutes but went on to lose 32 in the first leg
soon after manager seo returned as suddenly as he had departed having been gone for just 6 weeks  
in the second leg suwon went a goal down in the first half but came back with 3 in the second half to be on their way to the final after 60 mins played however kashima antlers fought back to get two more goals and win 65 on aggregate and would go on to win the final if you want to relive a part of that rollercoaster night here you gohttpsyoutuberxy8pagy1aq and heres an idea of the atmosphere that nighthttpstwittercomtheafcclstatus1055055104607285248

at one point it looked like they might qualify for the champions league again for the 2019 season but suwon didnt win any of their final five league matches and dropped to 6th

manager seo left again at the end of the season and will manage japans sagan tosu recently captain kim eunsun was released from the club for drinkdriving the drama just never ends

daegu fc

prior to the world cup daegu were languishing at the bottom of the table but after the return they found some kind of consistent form helped out by world cup hero goalkeeper jo hyeonwoo they really peaked at the right time as daegu made it to the fa cup final and against the odds defeated ulsan hyundai 51 on aggregate meaning for the first time they will feature in the champions league this is no mean feat for team whose best ever finish in the top flight is 7th place if they carry over their momentum into the 2019 season the year could be one of their most successful ever they will also be playing in a new footballspecific stadium this year

gangwon fc

gangwon are a fairly midbottom team i dont really know what to say about them they did have the 2ndhighest top scorer in the 2018 season though bosnian uros deric they also had the worst colour scheme in the league last season their kit is slightly improved this season

incheon united

i always like to imagine that incheon chose their strip so that they could be the inter to fc seouls ac milan they even have a nickname nerazzurri another nickname is the durumi    the cranes

incheon spent most of the 2018 season at the very bottom of table and had the jointleakiest defence in the league they brought in norwegian manager jrn andersen midway through the season to turn their fortunes around but even after that they were on the wrong end or the biggest thrashing of the season 70 against gangwon coming into the end of the season though they were playing really nice attacking football even if they didnt always get the result at the split they were still bottom but won 4 out of 5 games to pull themselves up 3 places

it was in attack that incheon shone montenegrin stefan mugosa was their top scorer in his debut season moon seonmin with the best goal celebration in the league also put in a strong performance but has now signed for champions jeonbuk nam junjae returned in the summer to score some bangers costa rican international aguilar was also impressive but has signed for jeju in the new season

sangju sangmu

the military team where other k league players get loaned to to complete their military service their history goes far back in one sense as various military teams were playing way back to the 50s but they were founded for pro footballers to serve their time only in 1984 although they were for pro players they competed in the semipro national league until 2003 when they joined the k league based in gwangju when gwangju fc were formed they moved to sangju

sangju sangmu do not have any foreign players for obvious reasons and cannot compete in the champions league although the chances of ever finishing in a qualifying spot are fairly slim

fc seoul

fc seoul wow what happened having won the league in 2016 albeit somewhat fortuitously and always finishing in the top half if not competing for the title in the past decade nobody expected seoul to be fighting against relegation although relatively solid defensively they scored the least number of goals in the league season of all teams their star foreign players almost all left before the season started including dejan to rivals suwon and were not replaced with the same quality and for many matches seoul played with an allkorean team one bit of good news for the future is that former captain osmar will return from his loan to cezero osaka for the new season

seoul at least managed to avoid relegation by beating busan ipark over two legs in the playoff helped by a red card in the first leg surprisingly they managed to score 3 goals in the first leg in open play

seoul is probably the most popular club in korea im sure helped by the fact that it is the main club in a city of 10 million people  seoul generally has the highest game attendances although it was much reduced last season because they were so crap

starting out as luckygoldstar ie lg fc in chungcheong province the team was permitted to relocate to seoul at the start of the 90s and were renamed as lg cheetahs during the decentralisation period they moved to anyang modifying their name to anyang lg cheetahs after the world cup the team successfully negotiated a move back to seoul and did away with their cheetahs moniker taking their current name fc seoul their founding and rebirth years are both on their badge  1983 and 2004

seongnam fc

gaining direct promotion due to asan mugunghwas situation seongnam is actually the most decorated team in korea

founded in 1989 in seoul as ilhwa chunma they were forced out of seoul and settled in cheonnan for a period in 2000 they moved to seongnam a satellite city of seoul and appended the city name to the name of the club seongnams title drought started when the head of the owner company that backed seongnam died in 2012 and the board were keen to let go of the club seongnam city government took over ownership of the club for the 2014 season and they were renamed seongnam fc seongnam are now back in k league 1 after a 2 year absence

k league 2 clubs

by last seasons standings

jeonnam dragons

jeonbuks jeolla province rivals they finished the previous season on an awful losing streak and were relegated for the first time

asan mugunghwa

police fc they missed promotion despite winning k league 2 and will probably lose their police affiliation by next year

busan ipark

one of the founding members of the k league and another that effectively predates the k league busan were beaten by k league 1 opposition in the prorel playoff for the second year in a row they were the first korean team to win the asian continental title in the 80s

daejeon citizen

one of the first communitycityowned clubs in korea

gwangju fc

relegated in the 2017 season despite finishing 5th in 2018 they still got to participate in the playoffs due to asan mugunghwas situation

fc anyang

founded in 2013 finally filling the void left by the departure of fc seoul from the city

suwon fc

the other suwon team they featured in k league 1 briefly in 2016

bucheon fc 1995

formed after the departure of jeju united from the city formed in 2007 1995 refers to the year of the organising of the yukong elephant fan club including 1995 in the name is meant to show its a club for the fans or something

bucheon fc 1995 are also one half of the 032 derby with incheon united because they share the same area code 032

ansan greeners fc

formed only in 2017 theyve had two 9thposition finishes

seoul eland fc

the other seoul team their debut season was in 2015 they didnt do very well last season although it was very tight at the bottom of the table

winter transfer window activity

from a monetary point of view korea is the biggest net exporterhttpsenynacokrviewaen20190131006600315sectionsportsindex of players in asia in the transfer market this winter window was no different with what i would say were the two biggest stories involving young homegrown korean talent going abroad

the first is that of jeonbuk and national team star centreback kim minjae nicknamed the monster there were rumours of an offer from english side watford but it wasnt clear if there ever was any offer or negotiations  kim himself said he did not know of any interest from watford it doesnt really matter now  kim signed with chinese side beijing sinobo guoan and will see champions league football with them in the new season being drawn in the same group as jeonbuk

the second is hwang inbeom who has signed for mls side vancouver whitecaps hwang inbeom played in k league 2 last season with asan mugunghwa and daejeon citizen but has impressed as a midfield playmaker and is currently seen as a replacement for ki sungyueng in the national team

for a recognisable name for western readers the best i have is englishman jordon mutch who signed for gyeongnam from crystal palace resulting in this awkward photo ophttpspbstwimgcommediadzg3adzvyaakrkqformatjpgnamemedium another recognisable name is mix diskerud on loan to ulsan from man city but he joined the previous year

k league 1s top scorer marco left gyeongnam for hebei china fortune and his replacement is luc castaignos signed from sporting cp his stats in europe havent been great in recent years but he may fare better in korea

there were of course a few hundred domestic internal transfers and number of other foreign player signings  if you want the full list k league uniteds winter transfer trackerhttpwwwkleagueunitedcom2019012019kleaguewintertransfertrackerhtml has it all



history of club football in korea  establishment of the k league

association football was first introduced to korea in 1882 when british royal navy crew harboured at incheon played a game it wasnt until the 1900s that football began to take hold and the first public match was played in 1905 there was a boom in in the 1910s with a number of football clubs being formed and rivalries began to form between clubs in seoul and pyongyang

the first nationwide competition was the all joseon football tournament joseon being the name for korea at the time founded in 1921 there wasnt actually a champion crowned in 1921 as the tournament was cut short due to complaints over refereeing decisions all this was taking place during japanese occupation of korea during most of the first half of the 20th century

according to the kfahttpswebarchiveorgweb20170606162658httpkfaorkrrecordhistoryasp football was the only tonic that could relieve the the national resentment that had accumlated in the hearts as a colony under the japanese empire and was a sprout that could foster the hope of freedom a tad hyperbolic maybe

one side effect of being a japanese colony is that some korean teams were allowed to participate in the emperors cup japans fa cup and in 1935 kyungsung fc kyungsung was a name for seoul during japanese occupation won the tournament becoming the only nonjapanese team to ever do so

the all joseon football tournament ran until wwii

after wwii came korean independence and shortly thereafter the korean war there was football being played during this period continuously when possible the korean national semiprofessional football league was founded in 1964 and is the predecessor to todays tier 3 national league many of the teams during this period were works teams  employed by a company playing under the name of the company but also having a proper job in the company cha bumkun said by some to be the greatest ever asian footballer rose to fame during this period albeit mainly in the bundesliga starting his senior career at the mighty seoul trust bank fc the most astonishing statistic about cha bumkun is he only received one yellow card in his career

finally we get to the establishment of professional football with the korean super league in 1983 now named the k league initially there were only 5 teams and 2 of those teams dropped out within 2 years the number of clubs in the top flight has varied from the initial 5 to a high of 16 in 2011 in 2013 the k league split into two tiers now k league 1 and k league 2

for the first few years of the k league teams did not have a fixed home stadium that they played in because there was no standard homeaway format that we are so familiar with today instead it was operated as a national tour

the k league in the modern era has its own history but one of the most interesting events was the forced exodus of all three clubs from seoul in 1996 as part of a policy to spread the popularity of football around the country also with an eye on stadium infrastructure for the 2002 world cup two of the clubs didnt move far only just outside the city of seoul each to one of seouls satellite cities yukong elephants only halfleft because the city they moved to didnt have a stadium yet so they continued to play in seoul until a new stadium was built for a number of years the k league was without any seoul representation in 2004 after the need to find someone to fill a great big national football stadium and help pay towards it one of those relocated teams moved back to seoul becoming fc seoul



football pyramid  league format

the current system looks like this


 tier  league  notes 

 1  k league 1 12 teams 1 relegation to k league 2 1 relegation playoff with k league 2
 2  k league 2  10 teams 1 promotion to k league 1 1 promotion playoff with k league 2
 3  national league  8 teams semipro no promotionrelegation
 4  k3 league advanced  12 teams semiproamateur 2 relegations to k3 league basic 1 relegation playoff with k3 league basic 
 5  k3 league basic 11 teams semiproamateur 2 promotions to k3 league advanced 1 promotion playoff with k3 league advanced 
 6 division 5 league 6 regional leagues with 52 teams some relegation to division 6 
 7  division 6 league 26 regional leagues with 174 teams some prorel with divisions 5  7 
 8  division 7 league 160 regional leagues with 960 teams some promotion with division 6 

as you can see the naming is completely screwed up  k3 league occupies tiers 4 and 5 and division 5 is in tier 6 this is probably because the top tier k league only split in two in 2013 with the creation on k league 2 and nobodys been bothered to update their names

the national league sits stubbornly in tier 3 blocking any continuous prorel the powers that be have regularly stated that they want to reform the pyramid to have a continuous route from top to bottom at least to the bottom of k3 league within a few years but for some reason its not happening the winners of the 2006 national league season were offered promotion to the k league but they declined the offer the winners of the 2007 season were also offered promotion but declined again even though they said they would like promotion at the start of the season

one of the more recent additions to the k league bucheon fc 1995 joined from k3 league because they didnt want to pay the higher fees associated with starting out in the national league

outside of this system there is the wk league the womens top tier the wk league has been dominated by incheon red angels no connection to incheon united in recent years theres no womens champions league in asia yet but for a few years in the past the winners of the wk league played the winners of japans nadeshiko league for a little more info on the wk league see this reddit posthttpswwwredditcomrwomenssoccercommentsaqkew5southkoreasroutetotheworldcupthewkleague

also worth a mention is the separate u league for universities and colleges some of the teams from which enter into the korean fa cup the route into a pro team in korea is often direct from high school or university teams something i dont think exists in europe some high school teams are even seen as feeder teams for a particular pro team i wont pretend to understand how the system works but ill leave you with the tidbit that park jisung was first signed to a professional team from a university team almost by accident as the scout had come to see a different player but took home park instead

k league 1

k league 1 consists of 12 teams playing 38 games the format is identical to the scottish premiership  all teams play each other three times and then after the split the top 6 and bottom 6 battle it out among themselves to settle the championship and relegation spots respectively the first tie breaker for teams level on points is goals scored rather than goal difference

the top 3 places offer a chance in the afc champions league the fourth champions league spot going to the winner of the korean fa cup bottom place gets relegated to k league 2 whilst 11th place has a playoff with one of the teams that finished 2nd4th in k league 2

international context

in the current format of the afc champions league the competition is split into a west region think uae saudi arabia qatar iran and an east region the east region is dominated by three nations  korea china and japan australia who decided it wanted to be asian earlier this century has also had a bit of success

this year there will be two debutants from korea  gyeongnam fc and daegu fc its dufficult to predict how well these two will fare but if they can carry some form over to this year they could get out of the group stages at least

determining who has the strongest teams amongst the big three east asian nations is a difficult task and is hugely subjective im almost i say almost because obviously k league is best league of the opinion that theyre as close to equal as makes no difference korea has the most number of titles and the club with the most titles pohang steelers china have the highest coefficient japan has won the past two tournaments

in recent years china and japan have had a number of big star foreigner signings eg paulinho torres which are absent from the k league i believe this is due to japan having cash mainly coming from tv money and china having cash from well being china despite korea lagging financially all three nations have the same limit on foreign players three foreigners plus one from another afc country and so korean teams are still competitive due to the relative strength of their domestic players

while were on the topic of the champions league each of the big three east asian nations get 4 places total  2 or 3 to the group stages and 1 or 2 to the last qualifying playoff round before the group stages this playoff round is massively weighted in the big threes favour as they have to win just one home game when the weather is still genrally freezing cold against a team from a nation with a tropical climate i dont know of a korean club ever losing this playoff match

the afc cup is sometimes said to be the equivalent of uefas europa league but its not really comparable the afc cup is for the weaker asian nations only and korea arent allowed to enter



resources

websites  podcasts

for those of us who are linguistically challenged heres how you can follow k league in english

one of the best websites for news match previews and analysis is k league unitedhttpwwwkleagueunitedcom it covers everything  k league 1  2 fa cup transfer news national team and more it also has a podcast if youre into that sort of thing

a really good resource for uptodate breaking news is an english version of a korean news outlet the sports category of yonhap newshttpsenynacokrsportsindex for example is great although youll be getting other sports news in there such as korean baseball football appears pretty regularly also the team that works on writing the articles dont seem to work weekends

tavern of the taeguk warriorshttpwwwtaegukwarriorscom has a lot of information mainly on the korean national team and tracks the progress of koreans playing in europe but covers the domestic club scene now and then

48 shades of footballhttps48shadesblogcom is a great english language podcast following korean football

the asian gamehttpswwwtheasiangamenet is another great english language podcast that doesnt specifically follow korean football but since they cover asian football theyll sometimes have indepth coverage of the korean clubs competing in the afc champions league as well as the korean national team

for your twitter fix the korea football news korfootballnewshttpstwittercomkorfootballnews and viva la kleague kleagueno1httpstwittercomkleagueno1 twitter feeds are pretty quick with breaking news in english 

there is also the official k league websitehttpwwwkleaguecom which can be viewed in english but i think unless you live in korea its going to be painfully slow to use

then of course theres rkleague with news and discussion and where you can ask questions to the community

highlights  watching live

all highlights from k league 1 matches are uploaded fairly promptly to the spotv youtube channelhttpswwwyoutubecomuserspotv spotv is a korean sports broadcaster they also upload content from the kbo baseball and the v league volleyball so youll have to scroll down until you see something saying k1 it helps if you know how korean letters sound phonetically to understand which teams are playing but you can also see which match a video is from the crests in the thumbnail the commentary will be in korean but each video is really good quality typically about 10 minutes long

if you watch to watch live the good news is that is very easy and basically free i have no idea whether any national broadcasters or streaming services around the world have k league rights but in korea itself essentially every thing is streamed on korean online behemoth navers platform the one caveat is that live streams are region locked so to access them youll need a vpn to get a korean ip address although some other asian countries also seem to have access i wont repeat what others have already written so heres a short guide to getting it workinghttpswwwredditcomrkleaguecomments7a3zpwkleaguetipsfordummies3icantwaittoget which also covers another route via the daum online portal or theres a comment in that thread which covers a more straightforward way by using the naver tv app

the kfa yout"
daegu,experience on the flight back to the us,"so me and my wife left on march 7th on the second to the last plane to the us before flights were canceled  we flew from from gimhae to incheon and had a 5 hour layover  at gimhae airport during check in we were informed that there would be a limit on masks  up to 30 per person and they could only be in your carry on bags  cant be in your check in luggage  my mother in law is a seamstress and made us 40 masks from cloth  the idea was that we buy our own filters which we would then cut them down to size and insert them in between the opening she made between the 2 pieces of cloth  on top of the 40 home made masks we had about 38 kf94 masks that we bought  we thought we were in the clear since we had home made ones but the airport officials said nope  we had to take out 18 masks  we argued to no avail we had our temperatures taken at the check in counter and passed through immigration  an hour later we boarded the plane to icn

at icn we were led directly to the main terminals and there werent many people around  when we landed all we could see were rows of korean air planes parked on all sides and just a couple of foreign airliners so we expected there was not gonna be a lot of people but it shocking to see we waited at the lounge until it was boarding time and headed to the gate   we were then questioned by an airport worker who asked us if we had been to the hospital in the past 2 weeks whether or not we went to daegu or been around somebody that had coronavirus  then we boarded  the flight was about 50 to 60 full and everybody had on masks except for the majority of the non asians  after the 10 and a half hour flight we landed at lax and i was kinda shocked of how relaxed all the workers were  nobody wore masks and at the immigration counter the officer asked which country are you traveling from korea and he replied great welcome back  he didnt take my temperature nor asked me if i had been to daegu etc  leaving korea was harder than coming back the us so i asked him how the situation was at the airport and if he was worried  he replied that he was but theres nothing he could do  but he said the government is already banning flights from countries that had big outbreaks  he wants to wear a mask but there arent any to buy

today we went out to hmart which is a korean supermarket and the only people wearing masks were the workers  water bottle packs were limited to 1 per household and all the toilet paper hand sanitizers and paper towels were sold out  even in korean supermarket we felt stares because of the masks we were wearing

im actually starting to feel that it was safer to be in korea than in the states after today  people over here are way to nonchalant about the severity of the virus"

its my first time travelling solo for longer than a few days i am a relaxed traveller i dont make day plans ahead but just look at what sights i want to see at each place and roughly decide how many days i need for them on the days itself i decide where i want to go i dont like changing hotels every few nights so i went for the cities i liked that were semi close to some other sightseeing places i would want to visit i dont want to be overwhelmed by having to travel every other day with a big suitcase so i want to focus on doing small sometimes overnight trips with just a backback for some of the other places

this is my rough planning for now

14 21 april 6 full days 7 nights  seoul staying in insadong  
mainly exploring the area i was in previously getting a relaxing start of my trip maybe a daytrip or 2night trip to sokcho

21 27 april 5 full days 6 nights jeonju  
jeonju seems like a pretty city where is the best place to stay ive never sleeped on a futon but id like to stay at least one night in a hanok would you recommend doing only one night or all nights for the full experience is it possible to do an overnight trip to boseonggwangju should i plan this ahead to reserve bustrain tickets and hotel or is it possible to do this a day before

27 april  3 may 5 full days 6 nights  gyeongju  
is it possible to do a trip to haeinsa andor andong from gyeongju what is the best way to go to both places i skipped out of staying in daegu as the city doesnt attract me and i really liked gyeongju

3  9 may 5 full days 6 nights  busan  
for busan im mostly lost on what area to book my hotelguesthouse any recommendations are welcome the sights i want to see most are the gamcheon culture village and the haedong yongungsa temple i thought of staying at nampo but it is far from the temple somyeon seems too busy for my taste and haeundae beach doesnt attract me that much as a location to stay but is closer to some of the things i want to visit is it better to change hotels since i do have 6 nights 3 nights nampo  3 nights haeundae

9  16 may 6 full days 7 nights  jeju  
i will be reliant on public transport is it best to split my time between jeju city and seogwipo and change hotels in between im going to jeju mainly to relax and explore the nature want to visit the manjanggul caves seongsan ilchulbong and maybe do a hike on hallasan

16 28 may 11 full days 12 nights  seoul staying in insadong last days myeongdong

hi guys  

im traveling to seoul for the first time with my parents during mid september and i was trying to plan how we were going to get back to incheon airport and i feel a bit stumped im trying to prepare myself since im the one navigating

our flight back home is at 8 am and i was hoping to take the airport limousine again either the 6015 or 6001 bus were staying near exit 6 of hoehyeon stationnamdaemun market but it seems like the earliest bus is 530 am 6001 and 550 am 6015 unless im understanding the timetable on the website wrong i think i would be cutting myself short and would not have enough time for checking in tsa etc 

i mean we can ubertaxi going to the airport but i thought i try using the cheaper alternative

i apologize if i dont make sense im typing this in the middle of the night 

tldr can you guys suggest the best way going back to the airport early in the morning 

also  if you guys have any recommendations on what to do during chuseok please lmk 


edit thank you guys for the tips i think well end up going with the 6001 at 430 am bus since the stop is fairly close to the hotel but if ever we wanted to go earlier to the airport we could go with the n15 bus then transfer to the last n6001 bus "

3 get bus from incheon and spend 6 hoursim not comfortable with this

i do not ever wish to come back here my only wish is to be home and have my passport back


update  after 2 sleepless nights and almostn3 days of rubbing my body with wet wipes they finaly found a transit flight for me after 12 hours and an other sleepless night in an other airport i finaly boarded a plane home i did not fully have my fill of rest and sleep
this experience taught me a lot and changed my perspective on the world

the police back home had their fill of laughter saying that they would treat a sub saharian african the same way they treated me in koreawith worse stay conditions actually as thats how customs around the world treat travels from lower income countriesas in you get refused and flown back if you show the slightest hint that arises suspicion 

i am thankful for reddit and the internet you guys kept my sanity at check


i should add this  the korean lawyer insisted that i should stay at incheon airport and that i will be allowed in by monday
no thank you"
incheon,best way to travel from incheon airport to daegu ,"best way to travel from incheon airport to daegu

just a quick travel tuesday question that i think could be supplemented by some personal experiences if anyone has them

i used to live in korea but its been about 6 years since then my fatherinlaw is wanting to take a trip back to say goodbye to his mother my inlaws havent lived in korea for 30 years and are technology illiterate so they dont know how to get around anymore 

they want to take a plane from incheon to daegu after arriving but i used to take the ktx train all the time and remember it being much cheaper and only about an hour and a half travel time a plane may seem easier but depending on layovers boarding time flight time and deboarding it can be 4 extra hours of travel

the only problem is that it appears that route might be partially under construction does anyone have insights i know we could take a taxi and go to seoul station and ktx from there but my mother in law is very frail and cannot walk long distances like she would need to for seoul station im just looking for a good compromise between ease of travel and cost if train or charter bus really isnt an option anymore like i remember i just want to hear it from those currently living there"
incheon,incheon airport  traveling from t2 to t1,"will be in incheon airport for a connecting flight my flight arrives to korea in terminal 2 but i will be leaving in terminal 1 i did some research but its still not clear to me i have a few questions  
  
1 do i take the train or the bus to t1

2 is the use of the train free or do i have to pay for it i saw a youtuber say you have to buy the tmoney card to board the train and transfer so now im confused i thought i only needed a boarding pass

3 how long does this transfer usually take my layover is only a couple of hours im getting worried about the time constraint it did not worry me before because i was previously told by delta that my flights arrive and leave in t2

4 do i have to claim my luggage in t2 as well and bring it with me when i transfer

incheon,yt video for first time travelers on how to get to seoul from incheon airport ,"for first time travelers here is a better than average youtube cliphttpsyoutubejdpanl8hab8sitio160ov2pgaj9jt637 i would recommend on how to get to seoul from incheon airport for the first time traveler using the train

incheon,summer in tokyo japan 5d4n,"1 didnt get the chance to explore narita airport that much i expected a lot pero domestic airport yung datingan hindi ko siya nakitaan ng vibe na parang incheon airport or baka wala lang ako masyado nakita talaga since deretso skyliner kami sa baba hehe hopefully maexplore ko pa pagbalik ko 
2 ang laki ng tokyo hindi sapat yung 1 week yung itinerary na ginawa ko ang lakas ng loob ko maglagay ng 2 places per day hindi siya nasunod sa sobrang ganda ng japan nanamnamin mo bawat place kaya sabi ko sa sarili ko okay lang siguro kasi babalik talaga ako dito baka pagbalik ko multiple entry na ako 
3 went to tokyo disneysea instead of disneyland kasi isa lang disneysea sa buong mundo pero may 7 disneyland sa ibat ibang bansa na pwede mo mapuntahan  ang saya nung rides i have been to hk disneyland and grabe mas pang adults dito sa disneysea sobra naenjoy ko siya buong araw ko pinagisipan yung tower or terror bilang umiikot ang tyan sa mga biglang bagsak na ride pero after ride napa yun na yon ako 
4 grabe yung respect culture ng mga japanese hindi ako pala bow pero wow buong week hanggang makauwi ako ng pinas nadala ko yung pagbbow lalo tuwing nagtthank you parang never ko nakitaan japanese staffs na nakasimangot 
5 ang bilis ng kilos sa train stations para akong mababaliw 
6 accurate ang google map sa japan isa to sa nagpa smooth ng travel ko kasi hindi ka talaga maliligaw since nakalagay nadin dun line na sasakyan mo  time of departure nila  
7 since sa tokyo lang ako mag stay i availed tokyo subway unlimited pass life saver promise hindi ako takot maligaw or kung saan saan pumunta kasi wala ako isipin na shocks magkano na lang kaya balance ng card ko based sa computation ko 34k nasave ko kasi nakuha ko 3 days unlimited subway pass for only p400 bundle siya ng skyliner roundtrip hindi lang siya magagamit sa jr line pero okay lang kasi lahat accessible ng subway except sa disney trains 
8 was torn between hop inn hotel ueno or hop inn hotel asakusa asakusa kasi ang lapit sa temple and other tourist spots but upon doing more research mas sulit and hassle free sa ueno kasi nandun na yung direct skyliner to airport hindi ka mahihirapan to  from lalo na may luggages ka
9 ueno 1010 hindi ako oa pero promise hindi ka magugutom dito nakakalunod na restaurants  inuman yung street from ueno station to hop inn hotel affordable din nandito din yung uenos ameyokocho  strest market lots of restaurants game stores pharmacy taxfree pasalubong stores abc mart donki etc walking distance din sa hotel yung gyukatsu motomura ichiran ramen and coco ichibanya walking distance lang ang akihabara kaya yun na lang ginawa namin nung first night since ayaw namin masyado mapagod and gusto lang lumabas para malasap hangin ng japan 
10 90 of the stores accept card small local stores  cash lang
11 sobrang sarap mag shopping sa gu for me gu  uniqlo dito lang ako hindi nag convert while shopping kasi unang tinggin mo pa lang sa tag alam mo ng mura tapos quality pa my basic crop top shirts are only p190 basic shirts pasalubong sa family p300 jogger pants na sobrang kapal at ganda ng quality p900 sleepwear set p200 ang sarap mag shopping lalo na pag sale 
12 hindi ko na to need iexplain basta ang mura ng onitsuka dito 3 pairs inuwi ko 
13 shibuya 1010 sobrang ganda sa shibuya sky  para siyang panaginip lalo during sunset tho a bit disappointed sa shibuya crossing malayo yung look sa tiktok vids  ig reels  pero 1010 padin maexpi tumawid dun bilang batang kulelat sa magpipinsan at ngayon lang nakapag travel nung nagka work na nag slowmo talaga paligid ko legit yung malayo pa pero malayo na feels
14 akihabara straight from anime sobrang daming gachapon nakakaadik maglaro dito 
15 shinjuku sobrang busy and daming tourist parang hongkong vibes ang sikip
16 asakusa  japanese culture loved the temple the oldies dancing and tourists wearing kimono sobrang ganda din ng view ng tokyo skytree here 
17 ginza screams luxury
18 mahal sa japan kailangan mo talaga pagipunan pero may mga restaurants naman na affordable but i think medyo mahirap hanapin if yun goal mo everyday
19 allot shopping time sa donki nakakabaliw mamili dito i had to purchase additional check in baggage pauwi  grabe yung selection ng kitkats hahah ako na yun napagod kaka check ng flavors 
20 mahilig sa photobooth wag na mag try ang tindi ng filter 
21 booked via airjapan ang ganda ng service ang laki ng leg room 

overall babalikan ang japan to experience 4 seasons pero dapat may ipon  forever na tatatak sakin gaano ka respectful mga tao sa japan 

also highly reco talaga to stay in ueno maniwala kayo sakin "

rating 77 hyatt properties ive stayed at in the last 8 years properties graded on a 15 scale for facilities value location and staffservice 43 properties in uscanada 14 europe 10 apac 8 latam 2 middle east globalist the last 12 months and exploristdiscoverist before that mainly leisure travel

main takeaway is how consistent hyatt is which is one reason why weve become hyatt loyalists over the years some might say were harsh graders but the mean and median scores are 14 which equates to b and a normal distribution we calibrated our scores to what we expect out of hyatt and when possible nearby hyatt properties

when grouped by brand park hyatt had the highest average score but as shown above we had a variety of brands in our top 20 including 2 hyatt places standard deviation is low overall indicating consistency andaz and destination had highest variance largely due to 2 hotels we felt did not meet the brand identitystandards

latam and asia score better on value and staffservice than europe us still scores lower than europe overall the 2 hotels classified as africamiddle east are both in uae we mostly stuck with hyatt region classifications but rolled 1 hotel from australia into apac

will keep updating the spreadsheet as we stay at more properties upcoming stays grand hyatt hong kong regency hong kong tst grand hyatt sfo hyatt place managua calala island booked on points before slh partnership ended cape thompson

note we kept slh and mgm for comparison to new brands such as lindner and mr and mrs smith there are slh hotels that are still bookable as mms as well as some mms hotels that are bookable on the hyatt platform or booked through the hyatt gift card promotion given the regular questions about mms on this subreddit and the fact that hyatt is still integrating mms hotels we decided to keep them on our list

incheon,my experience entering korea on a 90 day tourist visa 2020 quarantine edition,"psa ive seen a couple stories on facebook by folks who tried this and were turned away at the airport but also people have tried this and entered just fine korea is discouraging foreign arrivals due to the pandemic so your mileage may vary only attempt this if you already have a visa or youre willing to risk being turned away at the airport

hey everyone i just entered korea on a b2 tourist visa with a usa passport and am currently fulfilling my 14 day quarantine at a designated facility in the outskirts of incheon before coming here i searched some posts about what to expect and could not find a full guide ive seen a couple other posts asking what its like so i decided to write up my experience so others are prepared for what to expect

before flying to korea

at baggage check in the counter staff will

a verify your passport is not on the banned countries list

b tell you theres quarantine upon arrival and make you sign a quarantine agreement

c ask you to download the self quarantine app they show the qr code

d ask for proof of onward travel

the airline staff didnt believe me when i told them i didnt need a visa to korea it took me 5 mins of explaining to convince them

at the gate the staff give you a stack of papers to fill out

a arrival card  traveler goods declaration forms the usual when you fly to korea

b health declaration form asks you to list your recent medical symptoms for the past 21 days

c travel record declaration form list all countries you have traveled to in the past 21 days

fill these out on the plane before you land

landing in korea

note after you get off the plane i recommend you stop by the toilet cuz youll be in lines for the next hour

follow the crowd of people to the massive line for the quarantine booth it took me 30 mins to get to the front at the booth the staff will look at your passport health form and travel record forms they will take your temp and send you to the next station if your temp is above 375 youll be taken aside

at this point the line splits 3 ways 1 way for citizens 1 way for transit passengers and 1 way for foreigners entering i went the last route this led to a room with several booths manned by rok army staff wearing gloves and masks

the first booth they ask you what country you are from they check your passport and boarding pass then they give you some forms to sign that explain you understand youll be quarantined for 14 days what you can and cant do during quarantine and give you a pamphlet with quarantine instructions they give you a big lanyard to wear that says what country you are from

in the second booth theyll go through the self quarantine phone app with you and set it up theyll explain youll need to fill out your tempsymptoms 2x per day morning and night for the next 14 days theyll fill out your first temp reading on the spot so you can see how its done

the biggest surprise i had here was when setting up the app you are required to have a quarantine point of contact this is someone theyll call if youre sick and get hospitalized or they have issues reaching you during quarantine this person must be someone living in korea with a korean phone  you cant give a fake number or your own number because they call the number on the spot and ask if they know you i messaged a friend and asked if he was cool with being my point of contact to which he said yes i gave the staff his phone  the staff called him and got it sorted out

in the third booth youll fill out a notice of isolationquarantine  a restriction order on the scope of activities these are some legal forms explaining the criminal penalties of failing to quarantine

the fourth booth is the regular immigration booth show your passport scan your index fingers and theyll give you an entry confirmation slip example pichttpsuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommons225rokkisimmigrationentryslipjpg they didnt ask me any questions same as every time ive entered korea i love how some things never change now youve legally entered korea

theyll take you aside to the 5th booth where they sit you down 1 on 1 and ask you a couple questions to make sure you understand what youre getting into like how long will you stay in korea why do you visit korea do you have funds to pay for quarantine theyll register some stuff on their end give you a   quarantine confirmation certificate that shows youre registered for quarantine give you a lanyard to wear and send you off to baggage claim

at baggage claim you can freely move around grab your checked luggage i recommend you stop by the bathroom  buy anything you need from the nearby convenience store this is the last chance you can buy snacks before being escorted to quarantine

when finished walk through the customs booth and drop off your traveler goods declaration form

at the arrivals terminal exit they have staff in full ppe checking people one by one they check your quarantine confirmation certificate and your lanyards see that youre designated for facility quarantine and walk you to a quarantine bus if you are eligible for quarantine at home i believe from this point theyll allow you to go home in a private car

if you are entering from the usa or europe they will escort you to a testing booth first

i waited an hour for the bus to fill up with more passengers then we rode off to a designated quarantine facility the quarantine facility you get is random its based on which bus you happened to get on so your facility experience may be different from mine i ended up going to a hotel in the outskirts of incheon

at the hotel they gave everyone the agreement to facility quarantine form which says you agree to quarantine in this facility for 14 nights  pay the 14 million krw accommodation fee here they ask you for your passport and boarding pass dont throw it away so they can record your flight number  seat number they ask for your phone number too then they give you a room key and escort you to the next booth

at the next booth they take your temperature they ask if you have any health issues and what medications you are on seemed like if you need any medications theyll help get them for you

at the final booth you show your passport  room key and pay the 14m krw accommodation fee they accept payment with cash or credit card

then they escort you to your room and youre done the entire process takes 34 hours

inside the room they have everything a normal hotel room has like a shower  toilet  tv they provide some face masks and a thermometer to check your temp 2x per day they also provide new bottles of shampoo conditioner bodywash a box of laundry detergent toothpaste and a toothbrush

food is left outside the door 3x per day the meals are prepackaged and appear to come from a food catering place each day they give you a biohazard bag to put your trash which is collected the next morning

you are told not to exit your room unless there is an emergency and if you feel unwell call the staff and they will take you to a medical center for testing

visitors are not allowed they do accept deliveries from family and delivery places but only for medicines canned food or essential items ordering takeout is not allowed

they also put loudspeakers in every room which they use to announce mealtimes and other announcements like yesterday someone left their room to walk in the hallway and they turned on the loudspeaker to tell him to go back inside  then someone else tried to sneak into another room to see their family member who was quarantined on the same floor and they made an announcement saying youre not allowed to visit other rooms i think they have cameras in the hallways

thats mostly it and should give you a good idea of what to expect

post in the comments if you have any questions i will do my best to answer them

incheon,has anyone taken advantage of incheon airports covid pcr test for travel eg home country entry restrictions,"incheon t2 offers pcr testing and results within 24 hours for people leaving korea and in need of a negative pcr test for boarding the plane 

however according to their websitehttpswwwairportkrapcntkosvccovid19medicalmedicaldo this test cost 80000 won for korean citizens  and 120000 won for foreigners including a small additional upcharge depending on if you go get tested on a weekday or weekend

incheon,my arrival at incheon today immigration customs etc experience corona travel quarantine procedure,"f27 9 years in korea can speak korean no problem to converse naturally with officers not my first entry quarantining at my home 

i flew into t1 

arrived at 330 got into a taxi at 6 pm 

line 1 standard quarantine desk and give simple yellow form temp check and then information sheet for rules etc 

big line 2  the normal immigration area this step has five  parts

one while in line the young army staff helpers go around and check everyone has downloaded the app and that you put your info in it 

two sit down at desk and they check your grey traveler record form most importantly your phone numbers i live alone and had no problems communicating but i still needed a  so i put my korean bf 

three line wraps around to another desk where they actually call the phone number and get the app installed and show you how to use it briefly

four immigration officer desk one  she prints out some papers for you to sign agreeing to quarantine etc 

five the last immigration officer takes all the documents again and finally she takes the letter of no symptoms you have to get 48 hrs before departure  no one asked a word about that until the last step

youre released into baggage claim and then walk out like normal but then they sticker your shirt not sure what it means you then walk down the walkway  controlled aka blocked off with big banners to the very end of t1

buses run at certain times only with my timing the next bus was two hours away so i took the taxis they offered it is flat rate by district and for me that means 85000w to gangnam 

since its late the health office they told me to go tomorrow within 3 days is the rule and i have to walk there which is like an hour one way from gangnam station

and everyone goes on and on about how bad it is when koreans quarantine with family but dont follow the rules but the rules actually arent that strict for family quarantine pic to follow

quaranting with others ruleshttpsimgurcomai91l45c 

that above does not spell doom and gloom that to me is very loose with a lot of wellllllll try your best to be apart

all in all it was easy since i knew what they were asking and could ask questions if i was confused but it was very simple to be honest fill out some papers set up an app etc

oh and re no symptoms letter i got one from urgent care in sc for 125 no test done just a letter it was saturday so no regular doctor"

incheon,afraid that my love for solo travel is ruined,"im the type of person who has always gotten excited about backpacks packing lists and the idea of traveling the world alone as a 27yearold woman with no partner or kids its a prime time 

however my most recent solo trip and first one traveling to a country where i didnt speak the native language was a disaster

earlier this month i traveled to thailand i was meeting with a travel group when i got there but my flights there and back were solo i had it all planned outa layover in zurich a layover in mumbai no checked bags i was extremely prepared

then i got food poisoning at my home base airport and threw up on the entire flight to zurich when i got to zurich i was so weak and dehydrated that i ended up going to their medical center this caused me to miss my flight to mumbai i then rebooked with oman air and that flight was cancelled i had to stay in a hotel room that night

at this point i had no control over the situation but i was upset to be missing out on the whole group meeting i hated that id be the one person who was there a few days late the group was around 20 people 

i was able to get a flight through singapore by the skin of my teeth i thought things were starting to fall into place until i landed in thailand and found out that both phones i had brought were locked and unable to use sims or esims so i had no data my first time in a country where i didnt speak the language and i was alone and had no idea how to get to my hostel or anything i took the first cab i saw which was super overpriced 

when i got to the hostel i realized i had left my new iphone 14 pro in the cab at that point i broke down and sobbed on the floor of the hostels office luckily the cab driver brought it back to me and i was so happy i hugged the cute british guy who had been consoling me whose numberinfo i regrettably did not get

things were looking up right wrong i soon found myself throwing up again feeling weak and weird and begging to go to a hospital as much as i tried to hydrate it just wasnt working so i got taken in an ambulance to a thai hospital which was just an open pavilion building with a small er room and stray dogs sitting around it the language barrier proved incredibly difficult i later learned you can download languages for offline use with google translate but hindsight is 2020 i told the doctor not to give me medicine and just to give me an iv and a blood test i was given a medicine that had a very bad interaction with my antidepressants i told the doctor i was on them and my heart rate went up to 170 bpm they had to wheel me to the critical section of the room and put me on an ekg with an oxygen tube it was traumatizing

finally when i felt better and was discharged it was late at night due to my lack of phone service i had no way to contact a cab to get back to my hostel and the women at the desk had no interest in helping me after begging in tears they finally called me a cab and the cab driver spoke no english so getting back to my hostel was quite difficult 

once i did finally get back to my hostel the power went out for a few hours which is never ideal in thailand i only slept a few hours the next morning i was picked up and shuttled to the group i was supposed to meet with from the beginning

once i was with the group things were a little better i did get a sinus infection though which wasnt great i had some good moments but i was just exhausted and wondering if the trip was just a big waste of money on the secondtolast day i rode on the back of a scootie and fell off on a gravel road which left me with big gashes in my knee and hand i took a 1000 baht cab ride back to my hotel which was a bit on the expensive side on the last day i got bad sunburn 

it didnt end there though i had long layovers in both bangkok and seoul so i was planning on leaving the airports however due to my track record i decided to just spend the eight hours each in the airports walking around and going to souvenir shops i didnt realize that the incheon airport isnt actually the best for roaming around and buying souvenirs and all of the good food places were closed so i didnt have much fun there either 

i was pretty stupid and booked a return trip with three layovers bkk icn and lax my time at lax wasnt great either but i was in the home stretch i was so happy to finally be on my last plane home then the guy behind me stopped breathing and we had to make an emergency landing in phoenix since the superbowl had just happened there the night before it took us three hours to take off again by the time i got to my home airport i had missed my ride opportunity and had to take a train and uber home and to top it all off when i got home i was locked out

after all of this i lost ten pounds i did not intend to lose i have to see a gastroenterologist and cardiologist as advised by my doctor and my knee is still healing im also crossing my fingers that i get even half of the money back that i lost will nationwide be on my side 

i fear that whole ordeal has ruined my love of traveling which was such a big part of me even with the issues i had with past trips i still could look past them and enjoy the greater picture this time i dont know if ill be able to recover

tldr i had an awful trip to thailand where i was hospitalized twice and had a myriad of other things go wrong and now i wonder if ill ever get over the trauma and be able to travel solo again"

incheon,i am a singaporean living in korea ama,"hi in light of the recent vtl i figured there might be many considering trips to korea but might be hesitant because theyre not sure about how the situation is in seoul rn or how the tourist scene has evolved

i moved to korea last year at the very beginning of the pandemic when the first few cases hit daegu i havent been back to sg since lol got vaxxed here too but anyway i hope to give some insight to those who are on the fence

1 how are social distancing guidelines in korea right now

seoul and the greater metropolitan area gyeonggi province is level 4 other cities busan jeonju jeju are level 3 assuming everyone in your group is fully vaccinated you can have up to 8 people or 10 for level 3 as of oct 15 level 4 also means that all establishments have to close at 10pm but restaurants can continue to do takeawaydelivery mask mandate continues

2 are the tourist spots still open

myeongdong has been very badly hit dont bother the shopping streets in ewha and dongdaemun areas that had tourists as their main customer base are pretty quiet but life in other areas is basically quite normal and business is as per usual id say dont worry too much about that  just look for spots that locals go to as for attractions theme parks etc still open just running at less capacity i saw pictures of everland being super full last week 

3 i wanna travel to jejua different city instead of seoul how do i make that happen with vtl

you have to isolate for a day until your negative test results come back technically if you can make private transport arrangements you can go to whatever city you want after you land and isolate there but of course its going to be challenging going straight to busan or jeju practically impossible with private transport from incheon airport so you should stay a day in seoulsomewhere nearer to incheon first until the next morning then youre free to go

4 how does contact tracing happen if i visit a cluster

if its a big cluster there will be a public health alert  disaster message thing sent to all phones in the administrative area of that particular establishment to advise you to get tested free and if you visited at the same time you should also be contacted by the local health center to get a mandatory test free theyll get your contact number because before you enter any restaurants  shopping mall etc youll have to sign in like how sg does tt i suppose for locals we use kakaotalk or naver to generate a qr code tied to our local identity but i believe shortterm visitors wont be able to do this because you dont have a resident number so every place will usually have a book for you to manually sign in  if you cant provide a prepaid number i think you can give your kakao id cause ive seen some exchange students do that also discussions are ongoing on how to get tt qr codes to be verified with the korean system i believe vice versa for koreans visiting sg or people like me returning home 

5 what happens if i catch covid here touchwood

youll be send to a living facility until your symptoms subside the cost should be borne by you but thats what insurance is for so please get the appropriate policy

6 why are you in korea and how long have you been there will you stay here long term 

going into my 3rd year soon im doing uni here and i chose to study here because my department is not offered in singapore if i say what it is i might self dox so if you really wanna know pm but its something very specific to korea my plan after grad is to either continue with my masters here or work for 3 years or so then balik kampong 

7 is life stressful here 

yes

8 is everyone a kpop star or a walking plastic surgery advertisement do you see gong yoo at the train station

no

9 can you speak fluent korean or is it easy to get by without learning the language here
my topik score is a low level 6 so i would say yes fluent to a certain extent and i take a good portion of uni classes in korean but you can definitely surive without knowing much korean here if in a big city and actually even in the countryside can also la just use papago naver translate



ok thats about all i can think of for now i would say if you dont mind forking out the test fees and you want a more relaxing holiday go for it obviously things arent completely the same as precovid no more overnight shopping midnight karaoke or midnight street food  at least for level 4 but this is the new normal after all and you can still have fun

edit formatting also added some reoccurring questions to the post for those who are considering a move and want some indepth answers on life here especially potential uni students please feel free to ask or dm surprisingly there are not as many singaporeans studying here as there are in say ukus or even the neighbouring japan i would say for undergrad students theres less than 100 of us and the rest are working so i do understand information from a singaporean can be quite hard to find 

edit 2 wow didnt expect this to blow up so much i guess singaporeans are indeed very curious about travelling and life in korea thanks for entertaining me today it was fun respite from my midterm studying those who pmed me ill get to them too hope to see many of yall on the streets of seoul soon "

incheon,travelling from incheon airport to gwangju,hi guys so my home in korea is in gwangju jeolla province so i can go there to do my two weeks quarantine however im wondering if anyone knows how i will be transported there because i wouldnt have any family member to actually drive to pick me up since they all work and it would not be safe for them to come to the airport would i be placed in a shuttle bus because from my knowledge i know that there is no ktx going straight from incheon airport to gwangju u would have to go to the gwangmyeong stn
incheon,trip report first week in korea,"hello i used this community a lot in my preparation for our first trip to korea and always enjoyed reading trip reports so i thought id give it a go myself hopefully its helpful or enjoyable for some of you 

it was getting a little long so im breaking it down in two posts were still traveling so ill post the second one some time next week 

my personal highlights were during that time

 the visit of orteas tea plantation if wed been able to take their class this would have been even better but tasting their tea was a revelation for me i get now why people pay steep prices for high quality tea and take care in its preparation 
 diving with a haenyeo i was already fascinated by their history and culture but now ive a new understanding for the physical challenges theyve faced almost every day 
 joining a baseball game the energy is a lot different from sporting events in my country and we had a lot of fun to join in on the chants 

itinerary

sept 13th  arrival in seoul

we arrived at noon at incheon airport and made our way we stayed at hah guesthouse in dongdaemun its only a 2 minute walk from the subway so easy to get around seoul 

after checkin we made our way to aquafield goyang its a modern and beautiful jimjilbang and was very quiet when we were there on a friday evening it was perfect for relaxing after the flight

sept 14th  seoul

we started our day with breakfast at bonjuk dongdaemun migliore tiny so be there before opening hours and visited the korean national museum it was interesting but not very engaging so after a while all the new information started to blur together 

for dinner we went to mangwonmarket which we can highly recommend  it felt very local and people were very welcoming it also wasnt too overwhelming we ended our night with some cocktails at a very quiet cocktail bar called little big 

sept 15th  dmz

we went with vip travel to the dmz and chose the longer tour to the suspension bridge the jsa still wasnt open sadly we were picked up at 7 30 am at seoul station this one didnt meet our expectations it felt very much like an amusement park and our guide had little to tell us about the history and current events at the dmz i think wed have preferred to go to some of the quieter access points where shopping and entertainment werent priority 1 

we ended our night in gangnam in the coex mall for some shopping and peeked inside the starfield library during sundown it wasnt all that busy and the light was beautiful afterwards we tried bar tea scent which had tea based cocktails the drinks were creative but the service fee of 10k per person was quite steep they allow you to bring your own food though and will plate it for you for free 

sept 16th  chuseok  seoul

the first day of chuseok seemed like a good occasion to dress up in hanbok we went with 3355 hanbok who have a store right next to gyeongbokgung palace everything was clean and they had us dressed up in a matters of minutes  

we made our way to gyeongbokgung palace and enjoyed the changing of the guards at 10 am do note that during chuseok there are no guided tours be aware that the palace is normally closed on mondays and was only open due to chuseok and was instead closed after the holidays

after returning our hanbok we grabbed lunch at jamsil baseball stadium and got tickets for the game the energy was great and im glad we made it a priority to include it in our itinerary there were plenty of seats left btw which was different from the weekend games 

we had dinner at damotori h in yongsan they offer a makgeolli tasting and bar food try to reserve ahead because they only have a few tables 

sept 17th  chuseok  flight to jeju

in the morning we took a short 1h flight to jeju city and collected our car due to a delay we had to scratch some of our plans and only went to the prebooked appointment at orteas tea plantation because of the holiday they only offered korean speaking classes but they were kind enough to set an hour aside to let us taste some of their teas and to explain their production process simply put it was amazing their tea is so so good and there were only few people there with us so we were able to drink our tea in peace with a beautiful view of the tea fields 

after checking in we went for our first korean bbq and tried black pork and we lucked out with the restaurant  both our food and server were great and we finally understand the hype about korean bbq you can find the restaurant by searching for   it was close to our hotel minitel soul which was the best place we stayed at so far they offer free laundry service which was so nice and useful 

sept 18th  chuseok  olle trail 7

it was a extremely hot day so we chose to cancel our hallasan reservation and stay close to the sea we hiked along olle trail 7 the first half from seogwipo was lovely  lots of shade and great view points after we passed beophwan port though shade came hard to come by and we chose to hop on a bus and spent the rest of the day at jungmun saekdal beach there were lots of surfers there that day but otherwise it was a very quiet and clean beach with not a lot of people around 

sept 19th  eastern part

my husband had wanted to do a dive though they canceled because of bad weather forecast i wanted to dive with a haenyeo instead because im fascinated by them there are many different options to dive with them but most require you to pay for two persons if youre alone theres a village in hado though that accept also single persons you can find it on google if you search for experience primer fishing village   reservations need to be made via phone 82 1026853810 but the visit jeju helpline offered to call them for me so it wasnt an issue the experience cost 40000 won my husband was able to spontaneously tag along and due to the high waves we only dove close to the beach because of it they had us pay only half of the agreed price 

the haenyeo was very sweet and showed us how to dive for seafood i dont think it surprises anyone that she was the one who caught almost everything while we still struggled with reaching the bottom of the sea it really was inspiring to see and experience by ourselves due note that no one spoke english so we were lucky that we had another group dive with us who were kind enough to translate 

the haenyeo museum was closed because it was the first day after the holidays which was a bummer we instead hiked to the top of seongsan ilchulbong the round trip took us about an hour and had the best views weve had on our trip so far the clouds were rolling in then though and we just made it back a few minutes before heavy rain started we quickly made our way back to seogwipo and had an early dinner in the olle market 

this concluded the first half of our trip "
incheon,traveling to the incheon airpot,"im interested in traveling to s korea but the flight im looking at leaves s korea at 650am given the fact its an international flight im amusing id need 34 hours to get through security this means id need to be at the airport around 200300am in the morning is there any form of public transportation besides an expensive taxi that can get me there at that time or would i be allowed to just go to the airport the night before and find a bench to sleep on for a few hours does anyone have experience with this  


if it helps i currently have rooms reserved at the hostel tommy address  seoul korea jongnogu waryongdong 68 i havent paid for it yet so im open to changing it if there is availability and a way to get me to the airport on time

incheon,medboard ruling unfit at 18 years overturned by saf pc,"ill list the context in bullet format hoping it makes it easier to understand

 13 years tis i got really sick during travel in the middle of pcsing bases
 i had a 12 hour layover in incheon so i figured id go to osan and get the ibuprofen treament i ended up getting admitted to in patient care for 5 days ivs supplemental oxygen antibotics the whole shebang
 my medical condition was a splenic infarction caused by my sickle cell trait this happened because of being in an environment with less atmospheric oxygen exposure this was news to me because i was told by medical professionals that sct was a benignasymptomatic condition when joining back in 06 before sct required red tags 
 i arrive at my new base in process and do two tdys to colorado springs around 5000 ft elevation without any issues
 6 months after getting to my new base i am placed in a medical evaluation board  through a combination of covid madness and constant changed of personnel at the peblo office my case was lost in limbo for about 4 12 years i went through two commanders basically on a medical coding that didnt allow me to deploy or tdy not too big of a deal because my unit is deployedinplace
 my most recent commander takes over and notices my lengthy duration of my board and corrects the med group to have them get their shit together this was the proper thing to do but it was definitely a double edged sword that didnt play out in my favor i restarted my med board process again
 17 years tis  i go through the ipeb informal physical eval board  process in about 10 months the decision comes out  medically unfit to continue service dod rating 10 definitely a sucker punch
 i get in contact with odc office of disability counsel we start the appeal process to get a fpeb formal board this takes about 12 months then the decision came down  medically unfit their reasoning for medically unfit was that i pose unnecessary  medical risk for the air force despite being perfectly healthy for the last 5 years
 at this point im right at 18 years but things like sanctuary do not protect an individual against separation on medical grounds to say this was a blow would be an understatement the option to retire is right around the corner and im about to be booted with a invol separation payout which is laughable compared to the lifelong pension 
 i get back in contact with my attorney we start the process to appeal at the secretary of the air force level he was very upfront in letting me know that this was a long shot we were not counting on it to go in my favor we only did it to take up more time i planned to apply for las limited assignment status which is pretty much conditional retention til 20 years for people that can still do their job the longer i was in service and healthy the better my las application wouldve been 
 i get called by my peblo office today so i roll in and they told news that i still have a hard time believing saf pc overturned the ipeb and fpeb ruling  fit and returned to duty despite my condition to be honest i still find it hard to come to terms with it i feel that ashton kutcher is going to pop out of the corner tell me ive been punkd and hand me my medical separation orders 

its been a whirlwind of feelings this afternoon im not one to get emotional but i tell you its like i just been pardoned off death row or something gratitude is all i have for my friends and family giving their support as well as my unit leadership i had their witness statements and all of them backed me for retention my medical provider also gave her statement supporting the claim that i do not pose a risk to myself or other airmen ill call my attorney first thing in the morning to thank him he kept it 100 with me and im thankful he was in my corner im also thankful for big af looking out for the little guy i honestly didnt expect them to give a rats ass about some sgt snuffy when the medical board of the air force was ready to toss me to the gutters   


im glad i can now joke about this as a chapter that has passed 

  
some things of note i talked about the double edged sword of the commander fixing my limbo state she did her job as a commander to enforce timely and proper processing of folks going into a medical board but if it was up to me i wouldve asked her to let them leave me in limbo for a few more years  


it was probably that same limbo that was my saving grace it gave me the time to establish that im not a health risk and can continue to serve  


going through a meb is not a definite end to all those trying to stay in and im proof of that but make sure you are investing in yourself throughout your career be it 4 year or 20 if life happens and youre out sooner than you expected have something to fall back on

incheon,if youre gonna fly around the world during a pandemic know the laws and dont flaunt your citizenship,"update at bottom

hey im teaching english here in korea with all the corona stuff going on maybe you heard that korea was hit hard and hit second third regardless we got the brunt of it early in the grand scheme of things im okay but not everyone here is up to date or aware of how cautious we should be

so this is about a friend of a friend i know that makes it sound like hearsay but i can assure you i have all the convos and details to back this up but it doesnt make for a great facepalm jpg submission

enter bricktop shiny eyed mid 20s american woman teaching here she has a vacation on march 4th to vietnam nice ive been there its wonderful

well in late february the vietnamese governemnt started to get realllll serious about corona they said on february 28th starting on march 2nd any inbound flights from korea would be quarantined for two weeks no exceptions no special cases so what is bricktop to do enter mickey

mickey is a friend of mine shes cool her and her friends were telling bricktop uhhhh yeah youve heard right any incoming flights from korea are being detained and quarantined on arrival yeah youre not still going are you

enter facepalm im american im not korean i only live there

well wouldnt you know bricktop gets on a plane in incheon flight staff are you korean no oh are you vietnamese no im american are you sure you wanna take this flight uhhhhh yeah lets go

well sure enough she lands in ho chi minh 4 hours later and gets taken right out of customs

but what why im american

yes you are coming in from korea these rules were announced weeks ago and have been in effect for the last 6 days

whattttttt

her and her friend who went are now separated and quarantined for two weeks not self quarantine 

last i heard an average meal was white rice cucumbers and a fried egg ive been to hanoi the food is amazing just ask anthony bourdain 

the food is not so good when its on the viet government dime 

also all the vietnamese money they brought useless the hotels they booked the maids are happy they dont need to clean the room the food they could have had those are just titles on a menu baby 

if youre gonna fly around the world during a pandemic make sure you know the legality of your stay and maybe you should listen to your friends when they tell you said laws

incheon,broad tips from inexperienced traveler to korea,"earlier this year i got to spend a few weeks in and around seoul and traveled a little in jeju and busan for the first time this was also my first time out of my home country only knowing the names of a few dishes and very basic korean words hello thank you etc so i caused myself a lot of embarrassment d here are tips many of which came from this subreddit that helped me  

apps

httpspreviewredditwj19scxbdnld1pngwidth721formatpngautowebpsadfe2b566fe8a6dfb769b48054b721f2c6a0ca20

 i would recommend downloading these apps picture above 

 i used papago a lot to translate menu items coin laundry instructions etc 
 we used kakao t to order taxis 99 of our taxis were prepaid to go from point a to point b so we didnt have to worry about being upcharged or explain directions that much 
 wowpass had 2 purposes its a korean debit card and has a pass for subways and buses however they both need funds added to them i believe they are also loaded up differently 
    to add funds that will be used as a debit card there are a few machines to load it up incheon airport theres one near the arex some international hotels big transit stations i believe you can also transfer the funds back into your original account when youre traveling back
    to add funds for your public transit pass i usually did it two ways  

       theres a list of convenience stores on the app that you can load it up at just ask the cashier to load your tmoney and show them your card and give them how many won you want loaded in it 
       at some subway stations theres a few kiosks where you can load tmoney up i used my won bills to pay for it as well
 naver and kakao maps were absolutely essential for navigating especially when youre on foot or tracking on public transit it will tell you which subway line or bus to take and what stationstop to leave on the maps the highly rated places like at least 4345 stars are helpful to find good spots for food and like i used google maps mostly to find places that are more foreigner friendly as in there were positive english reviews of the place especially when i went to get my hair done the salon owner was fluent in english 
 i used kakao bus mostly to check when and what buses were coming to a particular bus stop but usually there is a sign to indicate this 

money

 keep won bills on you especially if you are going to the street markets and get food or items many vendors have their prices listed and usually only accept cash so having some small bills 1000 and 5000 won were necessary  

 if you have your debt card you can go to international atms theyre at airports and usually in the walkin area of international banks around seoul there you can get korean won but i had a cap per day of the amount able to be withdrawn and there was a small exchange fee 

 you dont have to tip ie stores or most services 

 if you are spending money at stores go to duty free carry your passport and keep your receipts certain stores offer tax refunds but you need your passport they can be processed once youre back at the airport there were some kiosks to put in your receipts then you take the slip it dispenses to the tax refund desk 

transport

 if possible avoid peak traffic hours on the subway in the morning when people are going to and leaving from work it was unavoidable a couple of times for my travel but over time i wasnt as anxious in a crammed subway car and could mostly freely stand without stumbling not much shoving or body contact despite it everyone mostly keeps to themselves 

 when someone gets off and leaves their open seat in front of you sit quickly lol i had someone immediately squeeze past in front of me to take a seat   

 when waiting for a bus especially if its crowded have your transport card in hand ready to scan and that you are in line ready to board it once that bus is pulling in at the stop definitely missed a few buses because i didnt have my card ready lol when you are leaving the bus theres a side entrance that opens for the departing passengers while the front door is reserved for the onboarding passengers like boarding you scan your transport card as you exit

 if you happen to go to gamcheon village beautiful place in busan in those smaller green i think buses prepare yourself for a rocky ride if you dont have seat xd 
 also buses are on time sensitive routes they will most likely start driving as soon as the last person boarding pays so brace a little while you are finding a place to sitstand
 there are little red buttons to press when youre approaching a stop most of the time there was someone else pressing the stop i wanted to get off at but be aware to not miss it

httpspreviewredditkho48rwrjnld1pngwidth828formatpngautowebps2f2fe7f785034ba6b8f0e87c75c4b701dbdbb05f

 above is a screenshot of the subway app 

subway lines were personally confusing for me but they are very efficient convenient and wellmaintained to go around seoul they are color coded and have two lines going in two different directions there are signs with english translations on which station the stop is heading towards next also on the subway car it has a voiceover and a sign that will announce in english the upcoming station like buses subways are not going to have delays really so i tried to get to the platform before they arrived  

 there are some restrooms and shops from clothing to convenience and other miscellaneous items in the subway

etiquette 

 you dont have to hold the doors for other people or be overly friendly in general as long as you are not too loud in public and on transit people tend not to notice 

 everyone follows the street lights to cross intersections and streets 

 do not order togo or carryout and sit downloiter in the store if you want to sit down please say youre eatingdrinking in the store when an employee asks most of the time for togo orders the staff have to give you portable containers for your items rather than glasses or dishes reserved for sitdown customers

 some sit down cafes will have a return station it could just have a counter or rack to put the finished tray and items on andor have a small disposal area for certain items youve eaten

 this may seem obvious but do not pick up pose and take pictures with fruitsitems you havent purchased from small vendors i saw a group of tourists do this to a man in jeju and he was not amused to say the least    

 sometimes people will stare especially older folks however because i pass as korean it did not affect me much on public transit its not very loud and i saw most people stare at their phone or the floor in front of them  

language 

 definitely learn how to say basic korean words like please thank you sorry excuse me this and numbers up to like 5 probably you will need to use them like when ordering food or purchasing items 

 maybe not as necessary but if you like certain drinks or food i would learn how to say them in korean  

time

 there are certain days off and holidays just be mindful when you are planning to go out for the day that the place you are going to isnt closed

 breakfast may be tricky since a lot of places are not open until 10001100 am but if you are need a snack drink or random things the convenience stores in korea are the best 

foods

 delivery apps like coupang is great for trying out different foods without any pressure to order but i believe you need a korean number to order 

 gwangjang market and similar markets where multiple vendors sell the same type of thing in my opinion do not have the best korean foods however theyre were not bad there are better food vendors at these markets other markets you kind of have to find them though usually therell be a line of koreans lol

other

 there are bidets on some toilets and a few places dont like to flush toilet paper down because of weak water pressure and a have bin for its disposal so prepare to use a bidet lol

 there are a lot of stairs if you are using the subway frequently keep to the right side unless you are in a rush

 clothing stores generally dont have bigger sizes but i went to the main flagship romistory store which carried kind of basic feminine clothing that is more korean style i went there twice and wish i could go back lol 

 if you love korean makeup skincare etc oh my god there are so many oliveyoungs in seoul im talking two on one street or across from each other it is much cheaper buying in korea than global sites and they have sales and promotions on usually on offer

incheon,anyone see anything unusual in the sky over the incheon area tonight ,"around 10  1030 pm tonight i saw what i can only describe as a lot of unusual activity in the sky over the incheon area it was either some major military operationtraining or  im not sure im almost embarrassed to even say it but ufos like a lot of strange things in the sky doing really weird things bright glowing objects just suddenly popping into existence in the sky often hanging stationary for some time and then travelling off at pretty high speed some of them were doing really bizarre things linking up in triangle patterns all kinds of things and meanwhile lots of helicopters were clearly trying to follow these things several rather weird looking planes also flew over yet none of them were showing up on flight radar which suggests military aircraft with their transponders turned off the aircraft were quite distinct from the bright objects they were apparently investigating 

i recorded about 20 minutes of footage of these things but i want to search for a prosaic explanation before claiming anything extraordinary so im just wondering if anyone else saw anything either military aircraft or something else "

incheon,buses wont allow large luggage,"psa for anyone travelling to korea soon i was travelling there last week in seoul and busan i just brought a backpack and a carryon suitcase capacity 10kg as i have been living in japan and packed light however my friend was meeting me in seoul from the uk and naturally used up her allowance of a 23kg suitcase and a backpack 

for the first few days we stayed at an airport hotel as we were attending a concert in incheon so subways werent an option the first bus we tried to board would not let us on saying they dont allow suitcases on we were super confused because this bus picked us up from the airport surely most passengers have suitcases beyond a 10kg after a few more attempts we eventually found a bus driver that reluctantly let us on it seemed they didnt have an issue with my luggage but just my friends the suitcase did not take up the aisles or anything so we assumed the first few bus drivers were just being rude

however once we were travelling in busan the same thing happened again this was a situation where we couldnt take the subway every single bus driver refused to take us despite the buses being fairly empty so there was plenty of room for us to stand with her suitcase i want to reiterate how not big her suitcase was it was a regular suitcase another thing that struck me as strange was that last september i had travelled to busan with my boyfriend who is an asian man and he had the same size suitcase as my friend and we got no trouble i started to wonder if we were being refused because were two young foreign girls i searched online for any information about this but couldnt find anything about a luggage rule on buses

however eventually i spotted a sign regarding luggage and translated it apparently the rule which came into effect on 1st january 2024 does not allow luggage over 20kg on buses be aware of this if youre travelling to south korea soon make sure your destination is accessible some other way like by subway or ensure your accommodation isnt too remote or just pack as light as you can it was a real pain and really frustrating"
incheon,is this seoul tour package sulit,a friend of mine found this offer online to those who have been to seoul what can you say about this tour package sulit po ba given this itinerary
incheon,traveling from incheon airport to dondaegu station,my korean is not perfect and ill be traveling alone i was wondering when you arrive at the airport is the train station from there a long way to go

incheon,an incredible 10day adventure in south korea tips and takeaways,"hi everyone

im back from an incredible trip to south korea with my wife and our 6yearold daughter and we had a fantastic time i wanted to share our experience and offer a few tips that might help others for a similar trip   
i wont go into detail about every place we visited but feel free to ask if you have any questions  
our itinerary included 4 nights in seoul 2 nights in gyeongju and 2 nights in busan we then returned to seoul for one last night before flying back to france  


before departure  
i did some reading and research about korea through books and online i also posted on reddit several things at first and received great advices i booked a few things in advance flights and accommodations via bookingcom well ahead of time for train travel between cities i used letskorailcomhttpletskorailcom where you can reserve tickets online starting one month before your travel date we also booked tickets for the nanta show on their official website httpswwwnantacokrshow and for busans beach traincapsule httpswwwbluelineparkcomhttpswwwbluelineparkcom which opens reservations on mondays two weeks before your desired date if i recall correctly  
for mobile connectivity i added an international option from my french provider which included 10 gb of 5g data 1 hour of calls and 50 sms for 2999enough to stay connected throughout the trip

dont overbooktake it easy and improvise  
south koreas cities especially seoul and busan are vast and it can take 30 minutes to an hour to get from one area to another we found it helpful to plan loosely by zones if you miss something dont stresshaving options instead of a strict itinerary allowed us to enjoy each moment we were especially glad we booked the ktx train and the blueline park in busan though we wished we had reserved tickets for changdeokgung palaces secret garden which sold out the day we went  
also note that most cultural sites open around 10 am and close by 6 pm and many restaurants close by 9 or 10 pm with locals dining relatively early between 5 and 7 pm

essential apps  
we used both google maps and kakao maps google maps wasnt always accurate for routes or walking directions while kakao maps was very reliableonce you get comfortable with hangul to help with translation i used papago which was especially handy for reading menus learning a few korean basics like greetings and simple phrases made interactions easier and was appreciated by locals

interacting with korean people  
we were genuinely surprised by how kind and welcoming the korean people were on our first day still feeling the effects of jet lag we needed directions several times a group of young people out for the evening went out of their way to help us find a restaurant recommended by our hotel even though we couldnt communicate much in english they were incredibly friendly and we had a fun exchangefrance for them was all about kylian mbapp  
everyone we encountered was especially friendly toward our 6yearold daughter people would wave at her and some even gave her small gifts or treats like desserts and candy in restaurants and shops they seemed delighted when she said  thank you or   goodbye when we left other children waved at us too we waved back which seemed to make them happy  
we did our best to show kindness in return for instance we offered our seats to elderly people on buses and trains as were used to doing in france and they really appreciated itthough we noticed this wasnt a common practice for everyone in korea

food  
we tried a wide variety of korean foods which were affordable and delicious generally we grabbed breakfast and lunch on the go and enjoyed sitdown dinners seafood was more expensive but the quality was fantastic especially in busan

the trip itself

day 1 arrival in incheon  
we arrived at incheon at 5 pm technically a day after leaving due to the time difference we took the arex express train directly to seoul station which was fast and easy i wanted to buy t money cards for public transit at the station but a lot of shops did not provide them we finally found one shop with t money near the arex access on top of the escalators if youre buying a t money card for a child with their passport youll get the discounted rate card over our days there we spent about 40000 won per adult and 15000 won for our child on public transportation free for children in busan navigating the metro and bus lines was straightforward once we got used to it and taxi was also a extra help

day 2 seoul  
jetlagged we slept 12 hours and started our day in the afternoon at the national museum of korea the museum was peaceful and deeply fascinatinga great introduction to korean history and culture from there we took a city bus to gangnam an area we didnt revisit as it was far from where we were staying we arrived by evening and stopped by the seolleung and jeongneung royal tombs before heading to starfield coex mall especially the impressive starfield library

day 3 seoul  
we visited bukchon hanok village followed by unhyeongung palace a calm lesstouristy spot that was really enjoyable then we explored changgyeonggung palace though the secret garden was sold out so we opted for the greenhouse and other scenic spots nearby that evening we took a walk near dongdaemun design plaza after exploring city hall and nearby areas

day 4 seoul  
we started our day at n seoul tower taking the namsan cable car about a 25minute wait and then heading up to the tower itself it was a clear day and the views were incredibleour daughter loved it later we headed to hongdae for the nanta show also exploring the lively hongdae area

day 5 travel to gyeongju  
we scheduled our citytocity train transfers around 11 am or noon to match hotel checkout and checkin times after arriving at gyeongju by train we took a bus from the station into the city center which was straightforward but took a bit of time by sunset we were at the daereungwon tomb complex where we explored one of the tombs with informative displays

day 6 gyeongju  
we took a bus to bulguksa temple and seokguram grotto both beautiful and inspiring sites with a peaceful atmosphere in the afternoon we visited gyeongju observatory and spent time enjoying the scenic flower gardens

day 7 travel to busan  
it was a quick 30minute train ride to busan but we were surprised to find buses wouldnt allow our large luggage we took an affordable kride taxi instead we started at jagalchi market for lunch savoring fresh seafood then wandered around biff street and gamcheon culture village which was full of colorful artistic displays and picturesque streets

day 8 busan  
we dedicated this day to exploring busans coastline we booked the blue line beach train from mipo with an allstops option although it rained slightly the scenery was breathtaking we had lunch near cheongsapo close to haywol skywalk based on reddit tips we took a taxi from songjeong station to haedong yonggungsa templea truly unique temple with a special atmosphere afterward we returned to songjeong to take the beach train and then boarded a train capsule for sunset viewing between 430 and 5 pm keep in mind that waits can reach 30 minutes for the train it runs just three times an hour and 1520 minutes for the capsule despite clouds the view was wonderful and the slowmoving capsule was a fun experience for our daughter later we walked by busan x the sky and strolled along haeundae beach

day 9 return to seoul  
we returned to seoul for our last night since time was limited we took it easy doing some lastminute shopping and preparing for our departure

day 10 departure  
we prebooked our arex train tickets to incheon airport the night before arriving 25 hours before departure was sufficient though checkin and customs took some time families with children under seven get priority

a week after reflections  
after returning to france a week ago and resuming our usual routine i can feel how much more there is to explore in all the cities we visitedand were eager to see more of korea including its islands still i feel like we got a meaningful glimpse of korean life culture and history reflected both in architecture and the warmth of the people i feel incredibly fortunate to have had such a memorable experience and to have met so many friendly thoughtful people along the way"

incheon,travel  first look seoul incheon airports new terminal 2 big on high tech art,NO BODY
incheon,earlier this year in south korea," 5day tour around incheon and seoul south korea earlier this year organized by an accredited travel agency for starters i think its more advisable to follow the travel agency path to simplify the experience significantly with everything already arranged pretty much all that remains to do is pick your daily ootd and hop on the bus or whatever transportation service that the agency arranged everything is seamless and you get to go to a lot of places without the stress of managing your itinerary and schedule

a downside of opting for travel agency tours however is the pricier travel costs in comparison with diy costs apparently because you pay for convenience another is the very obvious limitations on itinerary and schedule

the fixed itineraries mean youre often rushed with only a set amount of time at each destination i particularly felt this pressure at namiseom island where i wished we could have stayed at least 4 hours to fully explore and get a better feel of the majority if not the entirety of the area

there were coffee shops and other spots i wanted to visit but i guess thats the beauty of limited timeyou only make the most of it and leave room for future explorations

looking forward to returning in 2026 "
incheon,7 day trip report from 5 black people in korea,"thanks for all the advice and tips ive been lurking for a long time this is quite a read so for the lowdown and dirty you can just read my highlights and tips

highlights

staying in sindorim felt like staying local no tourists at all maybe 1 or 2 expats

gyeongbokgung palace met many cool people there and so many people took pictures with us and of us

hongdae skincare shopping olive young plenty of foods

myeongdong the vibe at night is immaculate street foods immense skincare things immense if you are torn between hongdae and myeongdong i would say if you like to be closer to the tourist activities like the palace and ddp then i would choose myeongdong it is also feels like it is hallyu culture all in one place street foods kpop skincare on steroids lol it is packed and very lively and busy hongdae feels like to me more edgy trendy has instagrammable places it is very fashion forward and lots of cafes and dessert places

my favorite neighborhood and place that i really liked was the gyeongui line forest parkyeonnam area definitely cute and aesthetic i just love the little cafes and the trees as you go more towards yeonnam it becomes more quieter and quainter so cute

tips

i am used to google maps and turn by turn but i couldnt for the life of me figure out the walking directions on naver i thought it would be turn by turn but you have to follow the dotted line on the map i got the hang of it at the end

navigating metro and bus wasnt too bad i found the naver app really straightforward with transport on buses and trains the signs and intercoms also speak in english the signs are straightforward tap in and out definitely learn how to say please refill my tmoney please

pack light because you will buy a lot of stuff i bought a suitcase thanks to reddit at namdaemun most vendors are really tight with negotiating they dont really barter but this guy we bought two medium sized suitcase for 90

if youre looking for souvenirs that say korea or seoul on it your best bet is to go to myeongdong station or you can go outside and shop on the street from those vendors i found most of my souvenirs to bring back for family friends at myeongdong station once you get to myeongdong station i believe you will see the signs to direct you to the underground shopping center part i bought many hats and shirts and it wasnt too expensive but it was cheaper too when you went outside the station to the vendors on the street

you definitely feel that pali pali rush culture here people got places to be and they got to get there but people definitely did stop and help us at the subway stations when they saw us struggling lol

i downloaded papago which helped for speech google translate was faster with translating pictures of menus things at the grocery stores etc

buy a mini fan it was hot the sun was beaming

gs25 and the purple convenience store are your friends

i had problems with withdrawing cash with my wells fargo bank from the atms but my friend had a local credit union debit card and she was able to with no problem we both have visa cards i had no issues withdrawing from a woori bank atm

most places take card the only time i really used cash was to buy street food clothes at the market buy my arex ticket and refill my tmoney card

if you buy an arex card once you get to your destination and exit the station you put your card in and get your deposit back

for my black travelers

we def stood out because it was not like it was one black person but 5 lol people oftentimes on the metro would talk to us and ask us where we were from

got interviewed by youtubers

young people mind their business pretty much on their phones the middle ageelderly people would talk to us

people reeeeeally like when you make effort in speaking korean they are some stares moreso from older people but we would say hello to them and they opened up they truly appreciate it there was this lady exercising outside and she literally stopped and turned her head and stared at us we said hello how are you in korean and she was shook she was so happy lol we got a lot of finger hearts and wahhh yeoppo my mom was feeling herself lol

people were helpful especially at the metro people are in a rush

kids will either try to say hi to you or be scared of you lol we would say hi to them or wave to them

061523arrived at incheon took arex to airbnb in hongdae thought ticket could be bought  with credit card needed cash went to foreign exchange nearby the arex ticket center and exchanged some cash it was 5 us with large luggages the train became crowded and we took quite some space we were at the end of the car but i didnt see luggage storage got to airbnb in hongdae did not look anything like the pictures so we stayed two nights at the holiday inn express hongdae which was nearby hotel was beautiful and super clean right near metro and next to ak mall the biggest plus was the breakfast buffet which was like a lunch buffet soup shrimp croquettes noodles we only stayed two days at the holiday inn express because since we had such a last minute reservation there were no other nights available for booking the price of two nights at that hotel was more than the price of the airbnb for a week went to eat at hongik sutbul galbi i was hyped for the reviews but it was meh the service wasnt that nice and they really were being stingy with kimchi also they were a little cold service wise but it filled us up

616 explored hongdae went crazy with the shopping m playground was our fave and the music was fire was a chill day we were pretty jetlagged ate dinner at chicken in the kitchen food was fire chill vibe server gave us a whole bag of yakgwa tasted like a brown sugar fried dough super good

617 checked out at the holiday inn we went to the 2d caf it was cute bought tmoney card at gs25 and put 10000 won on it took metro to sindorim was def a different vibe felt super traditional but still modern felt like a homey neighborhood this is where i felt like wow im in korea we just explored sindorim technomart which felt like i was in the 90s saw a wedding there walked around the food court tried korean mcdonalds bulgogi burger was sweet but it was good the meats at korean mcdonalds  taste real i dont know how else to describe it in the states we are eating something synthetic and gummy i know the difference now lol went to the rooftop of the technomart and it is like a park and you get a whole view of the neighborhood and station was incredibly beautiful

618went to ddp there was so many shops and like 4 malls next to each other we walked around and then walked to gwangjang market this place was bustlin tried some spicy octopus flavor and seasoning was good but the texture was what got me lol tried some mung bean pancake bindaetteok and that was super crispy hot and wasnt salty bought some canvas bags and shot glasses and trinkets from a store in the market walked from there to namdaemun which many of the stalls were closed there was one just closing and that was where we bought two suitcases paid the guy 90 usd went to myeongdong tried the street foods went a little crazy with the shopping my favorite place there was all mask story that place has what you cannot find at olive young i liked the prices here better and i got a lot of samples bought mad korea shirts and souvenirs at myeongdong station and bought a lot of streetwear from this seller at the myeongdong station underground shopping center i bought these nice oversized stussy and peaceminusone shirts probably replica but looked pretty good went back to sindorim to the emart which was huge and crowded it was like 9pm you would have thought it was morning this was the first time i saw my mom light upat the grocery store she doesnt want to admit it but she was in her element and had a ball there she wanted to go back

619 went to gyeongbokgung palace rented hanboks from hanboknam via klook i thought they would have a bigger selection but there were other places around with nicer hanboks the ladies were super nice though rather than booking an appointment i would just recommend and walk around and see what boutique catches your eye and rent right then and there took lots of pictures with other tourists met a lot of people from china and took pictures with other black travelers

620mom wanted to go to a spa so today was the first time taking the bus and we took it to paragon spa this was in the mokdong area it was cool to see the different neighborhoods like mullae etc we def stood out in these neighborhoods because there were no tourists lol there were maddd students everywhere you go there was just student looked it up on google and there are a lot of schools in the area duh but also hagwons paragon spa was closed it is for a while so we walked around and ended up joyeontan restaurant for kbbq this was my favorite and best meal in korea i mean the food was bussin i was translating on my phone the menu and the auntie came and was like this is what youre gonna get and she did her thing then the guy came and he finished the business we were stuffed food immaculate seasonings perfection they all were super nice and we took pictures with the guy who cooked our food because he was the star of the night auntie was busy lol

621went to the aquafield goyang spa and got a body scrub came out like a brand new person was an enjoyable experience and the spa is immaculate spent the entire day there and relaxed went shopping in the aquafield mall after

622 decided since we had way more bags than what we came with it was like 12 bags for 5 people it would be feasible to book private van transportation to the airport cost total was 158

incheon,which countrys international airport do you think is up to par with changi airport,"i saw this thread on public transport systems in other countries and wanted to ask the same question about airports 

changi airport has always been ranked as the worlds no 1 airport for many years it has great facilities shopping and eating options efficient logistics and aesthetically pleasing attractions it is also an aviation hub that offers flights to many countries around the world 

however im pretty sure there are other international airports around the world that are just as good as changi airport or even better than changi 

in my experience the incheon airport in south korea and haneda airport in japan left me the best impressions out of all the countries ive travelled to they have the qualities of a worldclass airport especially when it came to logistics and operations like baggage handling and security checks

how about the redditors here which airports do you think are up to par with changi airport"
incheon,train travel  incheon to gwangju,"hey all i have not been back to korea since 1979 and have to head back in may to deliver my mothers ashes to her city of birth the question is how prolific is the train system from incheon to gwangju i have lived in europe and have been accustomed to using the train system there without issue but when it comes to korea how is it any suggestions on my travel route anything to watch out for

i am trying to avoid having my cousin drive up i have heard it is a 46 hour drive to pick me up then drive back in a car where i speak almost no korean and he speaks almost no english"
incheon,south korea on m43,"i went on a tour of south korea with my 8yearold i havent traveled like since taking up photography seriously so i had little idea what to expect in terms of scenes and moments id want to capture we also traveled with carryon luggage only so i really had to be conscientious about space and weight as a result i decided to bring my m43 kit over my larger fullframe and apsc kits

camera om5
lenses olympus 918mm 14150mm ii and 25mm f18 for low light
locations incheon busan gyeongju and seoul

the 918mm was basically glued to the camera 90 of the time which was surprising as im not typically a wideangle shooter 

this was an easy kit to carry along with my daughters stuff medicine layers water and snacks during all of the walking and exploration we endured and in the end im really happy with the images i captured with it the format certainly has limitations but i will never look back on these photos and lament the shortcomings in terms of resolution noise or dynamic range nor will i hesitate to pickup the same gear for future trips

incheon,aa africa small town strange statue  monitor four hours of travelling by bus from seoul the south korean capital after touching down at incheon airport plus a stopover for a meal and refreshment break along the way we were finally in pyeongchang,NO BODY
incheon,is there anywhere you can go  anything you can do in an 11 hour layover yes im asking minus immigration  travel,"for future readers here is some helpful info

immigration both in  out did not take me an hour but ofc your landing  departure time varies the process 
i landed 5am went straight to immigration  was out within minutes came back 3pm went through immigration maybe 15min

if you dont dillydally  just shoot straight for immigration outin itll be fast but if you wait you risk a longer line forming 

if you are doing the free tourhttpswwwairportkrapcntentrntourtrtourtrtourdo they will hold your bagsluggagefor you so no need to search for a separate place

but if you arent going on the tour
its supposedly on the 3rd floorhttpswwwtrazycomexperiencedetailluggagestorageserviceincheonairportt1t2 somewhere or youll have to go outside to find it

you could sign up for the free tour to get a free ride to the city  then go on your own from there as long as you let your tour guide know you are straying so they do not look for you 
uber back will be 50 depending on how far you go from the bus destination 

could also be your guide dependent at the end of my tour my tour guide didnt hold anyone back who didnt want to go back yet only warning is to not expect english everywhere of course i downloaded the google translate app 

if you get there early like i did at the baggage claim area the first currency exchange you see might be closed go to the right  there will be another one open even at 56am if that one happens to be closed theres definitely a currency exchange open regardless of the time 



ive already read plenty of posts where all the user gets is youll be spending 6 hours traveling immigration blablabla

the dead horse has been beat dead for a millions of time lol i dont need to hear it again  again 

my question is is there anywhere not right next to the airport where i can do anything with me  my family

shopping markets sightseeing 



i was able to do plenty during my last layover in japan also 1 hour into the city
which is why im shocked people are saying 6 hrs of your time will be eaten"

incheon,2023 tips for a trip to korea  i hope this helps ,"thanks a lot to everyone who responded to my questions about korea 2 weeks ago i just came back from my trip and i would like to return the favour to the community by listing some hopefully helpful tips  some of them i gathered from other posts here others originating from my very recent experience 

sorry for typos etc in english this is not my native language

edit i edited the post below to add some clarifications following questions in the comment 



x200b

airport trip  trains

1 booking a ktw train ticket to go from a city to another railninja and other websites which appear first when searching on google are not the official websites and they charge the tickets with a significantly higher price than the official website official website is letskorailcomhttpsletskorailcom

if you struggle opening the website on your computer try switching navigator to chrome firefox andor opera if it still does not work download the app on your phone typing korail its the one with hangeul character and a drawing of ktx train

it is also possible to buy or change tickets directly on train stations such as seoul train station

2 website to book a seat in a arex train express or allstops train from incheon airport to seoul 

httpswwwarexorkrmaindohttpswwwarexorkrmaindo

3 direct buses from the center of seoul to incheon i did not know it but there are also buses going from certain areas of seoul such as myeongdong  buses number 6001 and 6015 directly to the incheon airport terminals these are not normal buses but special airport buses in myeongdong there was even an employee waiting at the stop to explain and ask people to prepare their money which are more expensive and look like intercities buses where the driver helps you put the lugagge in the special storage under the seats before going in the bus i used them for the return trip and it was extremely convenient not to have to carry my luggages through subway arex etc note that the price is 17000 wons and must be paid only using cash or tmoney no card also in my bus i was allowed 2 luggages for more luggage i should have paid more 

x200b

moving around

4 googlemaps wont be very helpful generally use navermaps or kakaomaps i preferred navermaps except in the city of gyeongju kakaomaps was more reliable for buses times

also googletranslate will be absolutely necessary someone suggested in the comment that  papago and deepl would be even better 

5 kakaotaxi was my friend i found that the fares were much more reasonable than calling random taxis in the streets i dont want to make negative general statements but my unlucky experience was that each of the 3 times i called a cab in the streets without using the app the driver asked me to pay a muchhh higher price than what my korean friend usually paid for the same trips and also much higher from the kakaotaxi indicative fares    i suspect that they just applied the night fare even if it was in the middle of the day or something like that upon seeing i was obviously a tourist

if like me you cannot register your debit card in the app notably because the app asks you for a korean resident number or other you can pay the driver directly for this you need to select general taxi in the app not the blue taxis etc and then select pay to the driver you will be able to pay by card or in cash the driver directly beware certain card readers in korea dont accept foreign debit cards so i strongly recommend that you carry a sufficient amount of cash with you in case your card does not work

6 public transportation is generally good and easy to figure out dont forget to buy a tmoney card and to charge it by putting cash and cash only in the machines which can be found in every subway or train station also dont forget to tap your tmoney on the little machine in the bus when you exit the bus so you tap when you enter the bus and you tap when you leave the bus

money

7 bank in certain countries such as mine france you need to declare to your bank that you are travelling soon its easy just a quick statement filed on the bank app otherwise the bank will suspect a fraud and block your card i forgot to do it and this happened to me   dont do the same mistake

8 exchanging currencies very obvious advice but i did not exchange all my money at the airport upon my arrival because there are currencies exchanges spots in the cities which give much better exchange rates 
edit someone commented that depending on the exchange rates and fees of your foreign bank it may be better to avoid exchanging money at all and instead just use atm to withdraw wons in my case the exchange rate at the exchange bureau was better than the rate used by my bank when withdrawing from the atm 1450 wons for 1 euro at the exchange bureau vs 1428 wons for 1 euro when using the atm on the same day so i guess this depends on your bankcard fees 

x200b

cities and areas

there are of course a countless number of interesting cities in korea but i had to pick 3 only since i stayed only 2 weeks  

9 seoul i followed all the recommendations in this sub and split my 8day stay in 2 first part in hongdae and second part in myeongdong first one was a young  1730 yo party and shopping area 2nd one was very commercial and touristic but really close to lots of interesting areas north of seoul both were good options so thanks for the suggestion

10 busan my favourite area was nampodong but i stayed in seomyong in order to be very central it was very convenient to go to haeundae beach and to other parts of the city i personally loved busan i stayed 4 days but i would have liked to stay 2 more

11 gyeongju for people who like small historical and very cute cities no need to suggest for an area to stay it is small but i would just like to suggest to pick a hanok for accomodation if possible it was great and i really loved gyeongju generally 2 days  1 night is sufficient but another night would have been welcomed for me

between busan and gyeongju it is better to take a bus 50 min  easy to find the websites using google

between gyeongju and seoul i recommend going from gyeongju to singyeongju first 15min taxi  approx 30 min bus but beware going in advance just in case  my bus never arrived so i had to call a taxi urgently and then taking a ktx train from singyeongju to seoul see above  letskorail website

x200b

phone

13 it is true that wifi is almost everywhere but i prefer having internet all the time on my phone and since data roaming fees in my french phone were absolutely crazy 13 euros per mo yes mo not go  i ordered a local simcard with unlimited data which i picked at incheon airport when i arrived i used this websitehttpswwwklookcomactivity16469ktolleh4gsimsouthkoreagclidcjwkcajwrpoibhbveiwa473dntkkrdo7hm4c5ptnhnbi0qgbzyimzhht6nsc9wco7sgpnnjxhd0bocuu0qavdbwegclsrcawds but i am sure there are others

x200b

global tax free

14 shopping certain shops will have a logo global tax free which means that they will deduct from the price part of the tax if you show your passport or a copy of your passport is sometimes accepted if they dont deduct the tax they will give you a form with a qrcode that you will be able to use at the airport to get a refund in cash

15 hotel some hotels also are global tax free so if you are travelling on a tight budget this may be something to look at for example i stayed in solaria hotel in myeongdong in seoul and i got a good cash tax refund apparently 
 the hotel must be part of the global tax free program to be able to issue the tax free form allowing you to get a refund 
 you must book with the hotel directly not using an intermediary such as booking 
 they gave me the form with the qr code and the details of the refund that i needed to get upon the payment of my stay when i checkedin there was an explanatory notice which also indicated some spots downtown where it was possible to obtain a cash refund in order to avoid waiting at the airport but in my case there was absolutely no waiting time at the airport 
 so at the end of my stay i gathered the few receipts and forms which gave me a right to a refund and i scanned them at the machine at the airport after passing the security and before boarding which gave me cash usd or wons no reimbursement directly in my card 
 please check online the conditions because there was a minimum 30000 wons 50000 wons i forgot and a maximum amount 


others

16 people were generally very nice and polite i received some help in the street without asking also i felt that some koreans appreciated that i tried to use basic words in korean
 hello annyeong haseyo which i actually pronounced ania seo but  i guess you should not listen to a french person for korean language advice haha
 thank you  gamsahamnida 
 goodbye annyeong 

17 wear a sunscreen i was surprised by how high the uv index was even when it was not very hot luckily there are very good spf50 sunscreens sold in korea at good prices 

18 there can be very polluted days in busan i even received an official text on my phone asking me to go home because of dust and very high pollution this day i also noticed that my throat itched and my nose was blocked most of my time in seoul and it got back to normal after i left the countrylots of korean people were wearing masks outdoors and probably like 95 of them were wearing masks in the subways and trains  not mandatory but very very common 




i hope this helps "

incheon,my lessons learned from first trip to korea,"im sitting in incheon now waiting for my flight to begin boarding as i wait a culmination of all the lessons learned over my past ten days in sk

1 bring your passport for shopping i neglected to do this each time and missed out on more of a refund 

1a confirm which of your purchased items can be carried on vs which must be checked dont be a novice like me and think that all the fullsize liquid skincare will be ignored by security and cue  my panicwalk back to the check in counter after realizing half way through the security line

2 you dont need to speak korean  but its much easier if you do even if just a few basic terms im actually surprised by how englishfriendly things were i also found most koreans were appreciative of the attempt to speak their language

3 purchase a pack of tissues and carry with you helpful for everything from a runny nose to a rural bathroom with no tp to cleaning up small spills 

4 if you tend to back up on travels bring guthealth or digestive health related meds the food in korea is absolutely deliciousbut it wreaked havoc on my system

5 public transport system is cheap and fairly easy to use but expect to look like a dumb tourist when you scan your card wrong in front of a whole line of people or scan into the wrong side of the subway and have to exit and reenter

6 taxis are cheap and sometimes theyre worth it we taxied from our hotel in busan to busan station and that helped us avoid the metro for a little longer total trip took less than 10 mins and was about 6 usd

7 avoid the major tourist attractions on weekends when possible i subbed out the palace visit day in seoul for a friday at the last sec was supposed to be saturday still crowded but not nearly as bad 

8 visit those igworthy cafesbut pay some love to the smaller ones too i found i preferred the smaller cafes which werent heavily advertised 

8a if visiting a pet cafe do research beforehand to determine if they treat their animals well we stumbled upon a random dog cafe and thought why not and visited it was not a good experience 

9 if traveling to smaller spastore outside main city streets double your planned commuting time i powerwalked the streets of gangnam uphill and barely made my appt on time

im sure theres more but these are the ones which have stuck with me most i also recognize that most are common sensebut tbh you dont think of those things until youve experienced them

what are your best lessons learned"
incheon,covidentryexit questions go here only,"weekly covidentryexit korea questions

if your primary topic is related toentryexit requirements keta qcode vaccinations etc covid tests where to get tests what tests are required vaccinations what happens if i get covid etcpredictions when do you think x will open what will change etc

please post here they are not allowed as a stand alone question anymore all parent comments on this thread must be questions relating to those topics if youre one of those people interested in answering these reply to parent comments travelers try to look over the other questions asked on this weeks thread before asking while some members dont mind answering it gets weary when every week the questions are the same we understand the rules are constantly changing but try to do some homework first the idea is to clean up the main page with travel questions about places to go things to see and so on and so forth cheers and happy travels

httpsoverseasmofagokrsgenbrdm2435viewdoseq761395page1httpsoverseasmofagokrsgenbrdm2435viewdoseq761395page1

the singapore embassy link has documents with testing faq how to use keta and qcode look at it and download the pdfs

1 keta for visa free entry httpwwwketagokrhttpwwwketagokr follow the directions exactly  bureaucracy loves rules do as they say and dont take any shortcuts with pictures etc
2 one calendar day before your flight  antigen test  two calendar days pcr test printed results and upload to qcode httpscov19entkdcagokrcpassportalhttpscov19entkdcagokrcpassportal
3 qcode passenger locator form httpscov19entkdcagokrcpassportalhttpscov19entkdcagokrcpassportal   

   1 you must now upload arrival test results to qcode too
   2 you cannot create the initial qcode until you have your predeparture flight results qcode no longer asks for vaccine proof it is irrelevant for all travelers
4 arrival testing is done most easily at the airport testing center httpwwwsafe2gopasscomhttpwwwsafe2gopasscom to book your appointment cost is 80000w it is much cheaper than the in town designated facilities around 130000w  

   1 arrival test must be done immediately upon arrival 
   2 you are recommended to stay at your accommodation until the results come not required no one is monitoring you
   3 the testing center is in the public area of the airport you are free to move around and come and go you do not have to wait there
   4 you are only stuck at the airport if you say you have symptoms or a fever they will test you before immigration and you will wait in a special area until you receive those results
5 you must now upload arrival test results to qcode too
6 test positive the official rules state that you must go to a facility for seven nights at your expense as a tourist be prepared for that mentally  

   1 if you recently recovered from covid bring a recovery notice the health office for your accommodations address each district has their own is in charge of your quarantine some will accept recovery proof and let you skip quarantine some will let you quarantine at your hotel some will send you off no guarantees varies by district
7 if youre doing a layover of less than one day in reality you would not need a test because youre leaving before the time expires however some people have reported issues about this no clear stories or details just vague chatter on trip advisor etc prepare to take the arrival test to be safe
8 korea does not require departure testing the departure testing requirements are set by the country you are going to not korea
9 you are not required to have a local number they dont check and call the cell phone like they used to you can write your hotels number or airbnb friend whatever however it is advised to get your own number just in case of any issues with testing if you have to quarantine etc otherwise youre at the mercy of someone else delivering these messages to you you can book a sim card directly from the mobile operator kt httproamingktcomhttproamingktcom
10 masks are required on public transit and inside all buildings optional outside but most people still wear them
11 no entry log vaccine pass nothing to enter when you go in anywhere no curfews or gathering size restrictions



for korean citizens or long term residents with arc

1 skip the keta your arc or korean passport is used instead  
2 same as above
3 same as above 
4 this is free for koreans or long term arc holders you must go to the health office in your district with your passport they will make you scan a qr code to fill in your info and then give you a free of charge pcr test youre recommended to quarantine until you get the results  
5 same as above a screenshot counts as a file to upload  
6 you can quarantine at home
7  11 does not apply or same as above"
incheon,how to ease traveling in sk with large luggage,my friend and i are traveling to seoul for the first time and well have 4 large suitcases between the two of us well arrive at incheon in the evening im not sure how long itll take to navigate through the airport but we may hit rush hour traffic we dont mind taking the metro to seoul but wondered if we should use an alternative method weve heard of an airport limo bus given the large suitcases we will also be taking the bullet train to busan later in the trip and wondered again if traveling with large suitcases will be an issue we normally arent this ridiculous but we dont know ifwhen well ever get the opportunity to go back to sk so we may go a tad overboard shopping your feedback is warmly welcomed

incheon,a robot just walked me to my gate at incheon and im shook,a robot called airstar walked rolled up to me and said do you need help so i clicked the interface and put my gate in and it walked me there what
incheon,"is there any chance ill get rejected entry to korea
","im thinking of moving to korea im a korean american born in korea

i dont have a job lined up just some savings and have no visa

if i show up at incheon air port will they be ok with the fact that im not going there to study or travel but rather to work intending to obtain f4 in a short while after arriving in korea for this purpose even though i dont have a job lined up im specifically thinking of working as a caregiver  if that makes any difference "
incheon,visiting seoul for the linkin park concert and need suggestions for accommodation ,"hello there

im visiting seoul on 28 sep for the linkin park concert at inspire arena my plan is to stay for the next two days and returning back on 1 oct

i would like to know whats the best way to book accommodation i see a few hotels around incheon near the airport and the arena so im guessing it would be convenient to travel to the venue for the concert

would that mean it will be difficult if i want to explore the city the next two days but staying near the airport would mean i can catch my flight easily on the 1st oct as well im a bit confused

appreciate any advice you guys can give"
incheon,my south korea travel experience,"we spent 8 days in sk traveling mostly around seoul and a day trip in suwon it was my first time in sk while it was the third time for my friend and we both have beginner knowledge in terms of language therefore we didnt encounter a lot of inconvenience

going around transportation was really great and convenient and was one of the things that i really liked specially since i came from the philippines naver maps also was very helpful as well as kakao taxi app only issue we had  encountered was when we arrived and the arex train already closed therefore we had to take a night bus from incheon to seoul station we arrived at around 1am at the station and there were no taxis and a really long queue waiting for a taxi it was 5 degrees and it was freezing for us who came from a tropical country  good thing i had setup my kakao taxi app beforehand and immediately booked us a taxi

food we visited a lot of famous recommended restaurants and some of them were a hit and miss one of my favorites was a random samgyupsal place that we found in myeongdong who offered unli meat and beef their beef were so good that we visited again a day before our flight back home cafe culture is also pretty big with all the pretty and aesthetic cafes however as a coffee lover i found their coffee at the mid level as for the cost of their food based on my friends travel from prepandemic she said that the cost of their food has gone higher one tip especially if you can read and understand a little bit of korean is to search the restaurant name in the main naver app and check their menu prices and reviews overall i think their prices are reasonable enough

attractions and activities theres a lot of things to do in seoul that we werent able to fit everything in our 8day schedule whats best about this is that a lot of their tourist spots are free based on my experience i think seoul is a really great place to shop since you can get almost anything suwon was also really great it has a really laidback and peaceful vibe that we really liked

people surprisingly i didnt experience any kind of discrimination coming from a sea country i dont know if its because we have features that are a bit close to being east asian the number of times locals spoke to us in korean and chinese was appalling haha but we still mostly look filipino what surprised me the most though is that the people who helped us more were unexpectedly the korean elderlies i cant count how many times they helped us without even asking for their help and they always try their best to communicate with us in english our taxi drivers were also really kind

weather we came at the week of the cherry blossoms peak which was the perfect kind of spring weather it didnt rain but was very cloudy at times it was also very sunny in some days which made the temp rise it was pretty hot haha lets just say that my skin was so much darker after our trip i also checked the weather in the morning through naver in order to know if i need to dress warmly

cons there are only a few things that i disliked about south korea one of which is the air quality my boogers were very dirty and bldy lol another one is their tap water because it dried the hell out of my hair and skin which triggered my eczema their ppali ppali culture since im someone who likes to take their time when traveling for more than a week however this culture helped out a lot in regards to their service their beauty standards you just cant help but feel conscious whenever youre out and about even if you tried your best to look presentable

overall our trip was great and was a really amazing experience will i come back definitely maybe as a solo traveler next time"

incheon,what to do in a 10hour layover,"hey well be traveling some time soon and we have a 10hour layover in korea seoul incheon well be arriving at 4 in the morning and taking the next flight at 230 in the afternoon what can we do to ease the boredom for a 10hour layover tyia

edit trip with family"
incheon,my journey as an american living in china,"ive been living in hangzhou china for more than 8 years wonderful city thats about as safe as a place can be im married to a local chinese girl weve been together for 8 years and married for 5 years we have two young children as well around november last year i decided i needed to visit the usa because it had been 2 years since my last return and i greatly wanted to see my aging grandpa

my wife and i decided i would take the trip alone and we would travel to usa as a family during the next summer i left and arrived in usa january 19th about one day before the major news started breaking about a novel coronavirus breaking out in wuhan and greater hubei cases were also popping up in other areas around china as well if i remember correctly in hangzhou we had heard rumors as early as late december and throughout january about a mysterious sars like disease but it sounded like rumors so hardly anyone took notice not a big deal right 

i was stateside a day maybe two and the news just swamped everything else we know the story from there they started locking down everything and more and more crazy news kept pouring out my wife was at my inlaws for the festival time just outside of the city they have a house and thankfully dont live in some tiny apartment in the middle of the city i became more and more concerned but my wife said to stay put in usa dont come back as it isnt safe the lock down got more severe and the case number exploded i was visibly nervous in front of my relatives what kind of husband leaves his family behind during a time like this everyone assured me theyd be ok and at this point there is nothing i could do i contemplated rushing back but my wife said they couldnt travel even if they wanted to staying out was the absolute safest thing they could do

despite the shit news i tried to have a great time with my family my siblings and i went ahead with our planned trip to costa rica which was amazing by the way many people jokingly called me corona boy my brothers neighbor told me to get out of his garage when he learned i was the one living in china i told everyone i dont live in the place that got ravaged but that didnt do much i closely monitored my health regardless and wore a mask anywhere with a crowd during my first two weeks

i was supposed to come back to china february the 12th but obviously my return flight was cancelled the airline said the earliest they could return me to china was april 24th but they could route me to a different city if i wanted i agreed to a flight on the 18th of february to seoul south korea because news was scary about tokyo which was my only other option i was able to easily buy a ticket from seoul back to hangzhou with one layover in between i arrived into seoul on the afternoon of february 19th their time and had two nights to rest before my next flight

my timing is ridiculous because the night i arrived the news was starting to light up about possible infections in daegu and the 31st person being found to be infected i took a bus into incheon next to seoul and closer to the major airport i didnt want to go anywhere super populated but didnt want to waste my day in the hotel nearly 99 of everyone was wearing a mask as the worry from the previous day was hitting hard i ate a nice lunch and strolled around for a bit and bought a couple of more masks for my supply i stocked up early into my visit to usa by the way 40 n95 respirators and two boxes of procedure masks among other things after my stroll i got onto the city bus back to the hotel 

that evening i didnt eat and just followed the news on my phone i sprayed my clothing from the day with disinfectant my suitcases too the next morning i put on my mask went downstairs for breakfast luckily the hotel was mostly empty but was perturbed because the staff werent wearing masks i took the shuttle to the airport and was off every single person i encountered wore a mask i rubbed my seat and the seat next to me with alcohol wipes when i landed in the first city in china customs was different everyone had to sign a paper declaring their health masks were mandatory and each individual was checked for their temperature and screened for any symptoms the rest of customs was easy picked up my bags and went back into the airport to check in for my next flight my temperature was checked before i got my boarding pass and again before going through security and once again before boarding the plane several hours later i arrived in hangzhou before 10 oclock and was told i would need to apply for a local health code the code keeps track of where youve been and what time if it is green youre free to move around and use local services like taxis supermarkets even return to your community if it is yellow you must quarantine for 7 days and red means quarantine for 14 days my code was green but i planned on self quarantining for at least a week before seeing my wife and kids

today was day 7 no symptoms yet i think except for some reflux probably due to travel anxiety and stress ive gone outside very minimally just to buy food and water  ive had a bit of a tickle in my throat but its probably nothing other than my head messing with me at least i hope thats the case about an hour ago a guy called me up and said he works for the local government and wanted to clarify some things he came to my apartment and verified that i returned 7 days ago that i flew from usa to korea and then here i said yes sir he asked me if i was alone in the apartment and i confirmed and said my wife and kids are at the inlaws and that i am doing a self quarantine he asked me very politely to continue the self quarantine for the full 14 days he then said that i shouldnt go outside at all if i needed to get food or water or what have you that i can contact him at any time and he will have someone bring it to my door he gave me his wechat number his phone number and the number to the community office he asked me to contact him if i needed anything even just someone to talk to
he told me that if i begin to feel any symptoms at all that i please contact him immediately and he would arrange a ride to the nearest hospital for the coronavirus by the way here in hangzhou they have basically designated two hospitals to handle the virus all cases go to either one of them  he informed me that it is best to begin treatment as soon as possible he assured me that i am probably in one of the best equipped citys in the world for handling this virus and to not worry hangzhou china is a very developed and modern city by the way 

my anxiety has been through the roof lately all the news and my own worries has been stressful to say the least but that visit just now has truly put me more at ease they are so well prepared here and definitely dont want another wuhan to happen i hope that everyone reading this can be prepared and take caution but also dont let the stress take over too much cheers and good health to you all"
incheon,5d4n itinerary critique and food suggestions,"hi yall im going to a trip to seoul in octnov and came up with this rough itinerary

this is my first time  to korea and most of this is based off of research from koreatodocom and rtravel korea to me im not sure if this is the most time efficient way to do things or if ive packed in way too many tourist spots 

do you reckon this is feasible way too packed or too time inefficient would appreciate if yall can give me some critique and suggestions

one of my main concerns is where to slot the n tower visit i think the day i have it one is kinda tight and am wondering if i should just visit it the first night

im also looking to get some food recommendations im not really into lining up for food so if yall have any favourite wall in the hole restaurants i would love to hear about them im super into bokssam and jokbbal but will also be more than happy to try new foods

thank you in advance

total 600 and 12 tests 

x200b



overall i liked the trip

pros

 hip places like hongdae are still lively

 can to go popular eateries like myeongdong kyoja without a queue

 was able to access korean onsen 

 cheaper hotels i got a four star at 76 a night

cons

 volatile travel situation the 10 day quarantine was imposed a few days before my december trip then it was announced it doesnt affect vtl it was a scare and this might change anytime i used this official sitehttpsoverseasmofagokrsgenbrdm2435viewdoseq761362 as source of truth and checked korea embassy page on fb for updates

 myeongdong and dongdaemun are half empty from the pandemic many places listed online have  closed down

 koreans arent used to foreigners so many of them will be surprised to speak english

 contact tracing for foreigners is done by phone since you cant scan qr you call a number before entering a store

 took 2 hours to process and leave incheon airport

 you will need multiple physical copies of your documents

x200b

feel free to ask me and i will try to help"
incheon,few days in shanghai before heading on to seoul,"hi all 

im planning our honeymoon for next year and we are going to go on a tour of a few asian countries 

we were initially going to go singapore only 2 or 3 days  korea  japan but upon further investigation we were thinking of going to shanghai instead of singapore 

were going to be coming from ireland via london so the flight time is shorter and then the onwards flight to korea will be much reduced as well my fiancee isnt the biggest fan of long haul so avoiding another 6 or 7 hour flight after a 13 hour flight would be great and the flight prices to incheon from shanghai are super cheap also it just makes a lot of sense

were both irish and therefore wont need a visa now httpiechinaembassygovcnengtz202403t2024030711254703htm which is a huge plus obviously we were only going to do singapore for a couple of days originally just to adjust to timezones and to recuperate before starting the main portion of our trip were not looking for anything super romantic and were not the sort of people to sit about all day on holiday even our honeymoon we like to explore new places and see new things 

ive seen videos of shanghai and it looks beautiful the only thing slightly concerning for me is the logistical challenges of setting up alipay  httpswwwcnbccom20240308chinaismakingitmucheasierforforeignerstousemobilepayhtml i did see this article which seems to imply its much easier now etc im pretty tech savvy and have travel frequently so would you recommend shanghai as a good 2  3 day stopover on the way to korea overall does this sound like a reasonable plan 

thanks"

gyeonggi,gyeonggido southern travel 1  ganghwa island,NO BODY
gyeonggi,where can i get a pcr test for travel back home in seoulgyeonggi,sorry if this question has been asked a ton already but the uk has just changed entry restrictions so now everyone needs a negative covid test certificate before entering the country and im panicking a little apparently lateralflow tests and loopmediated isothermal amplification lamp tests as well as pcr tests will be valid i fly back on the 15th so i need to get a test in either seoul or gyeonggi where i currently am before then i havent been able to find many english info sources and my korean isnt great so i was wondering if somebody could direct me to a hospitaltesting centre where i could pay for a pcr test within 72 hours of my flight should i contact the british embassy in seoul i already have to go there on the 12th because i managed to lose my passport
gyeonggi,i am a singaporean living in korea ama,"hi in light of the recent vtl i figured there might be many considering trips to korea but might be hesitant because theyre not sure about how the situation is in seoul rn or how the tourist scene has evolved

i moved to korea last year at the very beginning of the pandemic when the first few cases hit daegu i havent been back to sg since lol got vaxxed here too but anyway i hope to give some insight to those who are on the fence

1 how are social distancing guidelines in korea right now

seoul and the greater metropolitan area gyeonggi province is level 4 other cities busan jeonju jeju are level 3 assuming everyone in your group is fully vaccinated you can have up to 8 people or 10 for level 3 as of oct 15 level 4 also means that all establishments have to close at 10pm but restaurants can continue to do takeawaydelivery mask mandate continues

2 are the tourist spots still open

myeongdong has been very badly hit dont bother the shopping streets in ewha and dongdaemun areas that had tourists as their main customer base are pretty quiet but life in other areas is basically quite normal and business is as per usual id say dont worry too much about that  just look for spots that locals go to as for attractions theme parks etc still open just running at less capacity i saw pictures of everland being super full last week 

3 i wanna travel to jejua different city instead of seoul how do i make that happen with vtl

you have to isolate for a day until your negative test results come back technically if you can make private transport arrangements you can go to whatever city you want after you land and isolate there but of course its going to be challenging going straight to busan or jeju practically impossible with private transport from incheon airport so you should stay a day in seoulsomewhere nearer to incheon first until the next morning then youre free to go

4 how does contact tracing happen if i visit a cluster

if its a big cluster there will be a public health alert  disaster message thing sent to all phones in the administrative area of that particular establishment to advise you to get tested free and if you visited at the same time you should also be contacted by the local health center to get a mandatory test free theyll get your contact number because before you enter any restaurants  shopping mall etc youll have to sign in like how sg does tt i suppose for locals we use kakaotalk or naver to generate a qr code tied to our local identity but i believe shortterm visitors wont be able to do this because you dont have a resident number so every place will usually have a book for you to manually sign in  if you cant provide a prepaid number i think you can give your kakao id cause ive seen some exchange students do that also discussions are ongoing on how to get tt qr codes to be verified with the korean system i believe vice versa for koreans visiting sg or people like me returning home 

5 what happens if i catch covid here touchwood

youll be send to a living facility until your symptoms subside the cost should be borne by you but thats what insurance is for so please get the appropriate policy

6 why are you in korea and how long have you been there will you stay here long term 

going into my 3rd year soon im doing uni here and i chose to study here because my department is not offered in singapore if i say what it is i might self dox so if you really wanna know pm but its something very specific to korea my plan after grad is to either continue with my masters here or work for 3 years or so then balik kampong 

7 is life stressful here 

yes

8 is everyone a kpop star or a walking plastic surgery advertisement do you see gong yoo at the train station

no

9 can you speak fluent korean or is it easy to get by without learning the language here
my topik score is a low level 6 so i would say yes fluent to a certain extent and i take a good portion of uni classes in korean but you can definitely surive without knowing much korean here if in a big city and actually even in the countryside can also la just use papago naver translate



ok thats about all i can think of for now i would say if you dont mind forking out the test fees and you want a more relaxing holiday go for it obviously things arent completely the same as precovid no more overnight shopping midnight karaoke or midnight street food  at least for level 4 but this is the new normal after all and you can still have fun

edit formatting also added some reoccurring questions to the post for those who are considering a move and want some indepth answers on life here especially potential uni students please feel free to ask or dm surprisingly there are not as many singaporeans studying here as there are in say ukus or even the neighbouring japan i would say for undergrad students theres less than 100 of us and the rest are working so i do understand information from a singaporean can be quite hard to find 

edit 2 wow didnt expect this to blow up so much i guess singaporeans are indeed very curious about travelling and life in korea thanks for entertaining me today it was fun respite from my midterm studying those who pmed me ill get to them too hope to see many of yall on the streets of seoul soon "

i have plans to travel to south korea in the near future will i be ok

since the situation is continuously evolving its impossible to say check your countrys travel advisories for south korea and try to stay on top of the news to determine whether to continue with your travel plans or not

i plan to travel tofrom south korea will i run into any problems in other countries

at the time this is being written israel bahrain jordan kiribati samoa and american samoa have banned visitors from south korea and some airlinescountries have stopped direct flights to south korea since this is an ongoing situation its best to check with the airline you will be flying with to see if there are changes to your itinerary and the country you will be traveling to to see if there are any restrictions on people flying in from south korea

gyeonggi,my rural placement teaching experience,"hello reddit long time reader first time poster here

youtube seemed like too much work so ive turned to reddit to share my experience as an epik teacher in south korea i really wanted to put something out there for anyone thinking about doing epik or any teachers preparing for their big move to south korea so here goes 

first off i do not have a teaching degree nor any previous teaching experience before epik i am in my late twenties did not have anything back home tying me down so thought it was the right time in my life to do something like this as i was ready for a new adventure i also didnt really have any expectations or truly know what i was doing i was just at a point in my life where i wantedneeded to do something different and thought this seemed like a fun and crazy experience that would be one i could talk about in years to come i like to think that my age lifestyle and years worked in the corporate world benefited me in the sense of my maturity adaptability ill touch on this later and longing for a new adventure  so i knew i was ready for this despite the littletono information that i really had on the whole epik thing 

i wont spend too much time on the whole applicationpaperwork process as there is definitely ample youtube videosthreads on all this  for me i actually did find the process rather straightforward as compared to some countries i didnt have any major backlogsdelays and i only have to go to the one place as opposed to certain state offices us citizens have to work around things just seemed to worked out really well for me at the time too when i had to get my visa processed the consulate ended up being in my town that week so i didnt have to make a 6 hour return drive to do that so you could say it was fate that was helping me get to south korea

okay so fast forward to dday leaving my home to fly to south korea  i was really more excited to travel more than anything else i didnt really click that i was moving for work it more felt like a holiday at this point especially because i had a oneweek orientation to get through first before actually starting my job personally i flew in 2 days before we had to meet epik at the airport monday just because thats when i got the best deal for a flight  in hindsight i would have reconsidered the flight that arrived later in the day on the monday so i would have saved on 2 nights accommodation cost as the whole of monday was a right off anyway we didnt actually end up doing anything orientation wise so if you want to save on money ill touch on this later i would fly in on the monday ideally landing before 34pm so you can still get an epik bus to the orientation venue 

orientation really just felt like a school camp except you dont know anyone its fucking hot and humid and you are making lots of small talk to figure out whos cool and whos a bit strange personally i really enjoyed orientation apart from the boring lectures that really were not helpful at all i am a pretty outgoing person so i enjoyed meeting and talking to new people and again i still hadnt computed that i was going to be working in a weeks time so i guess it felt like i was on holiday mode however i have talked to people since and they said they hated orientation i think that might be due to the fact that theyre either introverted so meeting so many new people was overwhelming or they were missing home or other reasons im not aware of but as far as im concerned youve already committed to this job on the other side of the world where everybody knows no one were all in the same boat so you need to make the most of it  thats where i was at anyway i thought i found a nice friend group from orientation ill touch on this later so that was really nice to have a little group chat going once we were all separated that we could compare our housesschoolsstudentsetc as we all got settled 

ps the demo lessons are not even scary  im not a qualified teacher and it was fine  
pps you definitely get a glimpse to the fact that they really let anyone into the epik programme 

okay this is where things get interesting for me  the final evening at orientation is where everyones anxiety levels max and some also shed tears  the evening where you receive your school placement which in turn tells you the citytown where you will be living for context i had put my placement preference as seoul but got gyeonggi so if you are familiar with epik you know that before you fly to korea you are only told the region you will be placed in not your city or town so i knew id be in gyeonggi however gyeonggi is huge so i really could have been placed anywhere  delulu me i was hoping for a suwon or seongnam placement a city but still close enough to seoul when i got the paper that had my school name on it i immediately googled the name of the school and pyeongtaek came up  the most southern city in gyeonggi furthest away from seoul  lol at this point i was just glad to have more information although thats all i knew at this point didnt know where i would be living or what my school was like so after googling pyeongtaek enough times i came to terms that its a city and has enough things going on that it would be okay and a big thing for me  it was easy to get to seoul i had also made friends with another girl that was also placed in pyeongtaek and for those that dont know pyeongtaek is big but fate if you will had it that we were place 30 minutes away from each other i wasnt upset like some people were i heard there were lots of tears etc but again i have to say youve come this far you knew what you were getting into when you heard a million times that epiks whole system is not telling you details till the last minute so really all you can do is accept it and embrace the new opportunity

okay come the day we had to wake up early to be bused off to our new lives for the next year once again i still felt like i was on some sort of retreat not mentally prepared i was going to be working the next day so you get off the bus and wave a quick goodbye to the other epik teachers you barely know but fully understand and then epik essentially wash their hands of you as they hurry you off in your taxi at this point you dont actually know where youre going  it could be straight to your school or your apartment after an hour or so drive in the paid for taxi i was really humbled as we slowed down when we pulled off a main road into what i can describe as a very small derelict village granted i have come to appreciate the village but at the time i was thinking no this isnt the streets of seoul with high rises and bustling streets that i had imagined and seen all over youtube we then arrived at a small villa apartment my first thought was oh god if im on the top fourth floor i hope there is an elevator for my 3 suitcases spoiler alert i was on the ground floor nb pack light  i regret bringing 3 suitcases anyway my coteacher eventually arrived and showed me my apartment it was actually great no qualms here not super modern but good size for 1 person and everything works fine i did have a typical korean wet room bathroom which i was hoping to have normal western shower but ive since come to love the wet room style me and my coteacher then walked about 10 minutes to the main only road in the village for a coffee and then to school to show me around and meet the principal quickly i was essentially then let off for the day and able to go back home to unpack and settle in its about here that i think anyone else might have started freaking out and considering doing a midnight run  my mind however never went there i think circling back to the fact that i had committed to this i really didnt have anything else to run back to i really did just roll with it and i am so glad i did i did however not have any bedding for the next 3 nights but it was summer and warm enough that it wasnt a big issue 

like i mentioned the wrong person in this placement certainly would have done a runner im not exaggerating when i say that it is just one road for maybe 150m and then a couple side streets with barley any shopshouses but i have come to love and appreciate the village it is quiet peaceful and i will cherish the year i got to live here granted i did not spend a whole lot of time here as most of my weekendsvacation i spent exploring korea or staying with friends in seoul

the friend group i made in orientation is not necessarily the same one i am close friends with now  i think orientation sort of covers everything with rose tinted glasses and everyone is putting on their best face spending weekends even overnight trips with these friends outside of orientation you really get to know people and sometimes you realise that theyre not your people and youre probably not theirs either  and that is totally fine you dont have to be friends with everyone especially if they dont make you feel good after spending time with them  thats on being a mature adult i did however make amazing best friends also from my epik intake that have made my first year in korea amazing i have spent my time and money well on weekends and days off exploring and seeing all that i can

on the topic of money  as you may have hear the epik pay is shite and definitely not sustainable the last week before pay day is a real struggle and i hate it but i definitely dont have any regrets on how i spend my money  on exploring activities and travelling  as opposed to staying home on weekends to try save money  thats not how i want to spend my limited time in korea one thing i do regret is not having a little safety net of money tucked away i did but that got eaten up fast in the first couple of months youre not in this job for the money so you need to prepare for that

in terms of my school placements  i had two schools  my main school an elementary school with about 50 students and my second school a middle school with about 60 students being a rural placement you are highly likely to get more than one school i actually really enjoyed both of my schools i never had any issues with coteachers or students and my schedule worked out so good like so good like only 3 hours at school on monday and then home lol shhh dont tell epik

if you are a new epik teacher what i really hope that you get out of reading this is that if you are placed in a village a small town you didnt hope for or if your coteachersstudents are being nice right now please just stick it out it will get better and really you can make the best out of any situation you are in it might not be easy right now but just be strong and positive if i can do a year in the village you can do anything

now as much as i can talk up the village i couldnt do another year placed here im a city girl and seoul is where i need to be so yes i am moving to seoul with epik for another year i know that my school will not be as easy as i had it in the village ill be doing more work maybe my coteachers wont be as easy to deal with but i am mentally ready and so excited for my next adventure

i really did try to touch on a bit of everything especially from a rural placement perspective  but please if you have any questions let me know i am happy to share

gyeonggi,thoughts of an older teacher,"okay i have waffled on whether to post anything here ever but i am seeing more posts by older folks from na about whether to come ive been here for a bit now not for ages like some people but long enough to know some things ive also mentored new to instructioneducation folks here and back home here are some thoughts many of which may go against some of the commonly repeated lines

other things to preface employed in education nonteaching roles support admin and then private instruction for many years before coming to korea im old by the standards of the should you be here should you do that job question im also a guy from north america

1 the pay isnt that bad im not sure how some folks spend their money but that is a big question for me education pay has been depressed everywhere for the time folks complain about pay not rising in korea it does suck but lifestyle afforded is comparable or better than entry or low level full time jobs in the west more money is always nice but its not the 2000s anymore anywhere if youre maxing  there are better options
2 starting pay isnt the ending pay finding a good academy and proving yourself to them is one of the best routes for increasing pay job hopping at the year also increases the pay lots of good places only hire in korea because its cheaper more reliable and in offering higher pay they can
3 the blacklist is a mess lots of folks who have never worked in education have an idealized vision of what was going on behind the curtain when they were a kid public private university and even private clubs theyre mostly all a mess at the organization level kids are messy kids create problems organizations that work with kids are full of problems its a constant there is a world of difference between the truth that all jobs suck and this employer will steal from you and work you to death spotting it can be hard
4 kindergarten is hard as  to teach know what youre getting yourself into before signing up for that
5 if youre fresh from college or younger you need to learn patience and to learn your place in an organization many folks from the west are overeager to give input or try to make improvements at the system level its annoying in the west but it is far more tolerated there than here constant suggestions in korea will make you enemies you dont want to make learn how to choose what actually matters and learn how to bring up suggestions in a cautious way advantage older workers
6 learn korean any learning will return massively on the investment
7 making friends is hard find a club leave work go places where people do similar things get that ig or kakao from somebody meeting people leads to meeting more people
8 dating is easier than making good friends seems like a good thing but it kinda sucks after a while
9 the pandemic seems to have really dampened the workdrinking culture im older so it bums me out but i see folks ask about this a lot
10 i wouldnt advise somebody fresh out of college or from europe to come over here if youre an e2 qualifying european wanting to travel theres better destinations if youre fresh out of college this is going to be harder than a ft near you
11 gyeonggido is a hilariously overrated placement
12 unless youre from nyc london or other major dense metropolises the top 25 korean cities by size will seem large to you and have most of the amenities you could want in tandem with number 11 its better to live downtown in a midsized city than to get a random gyeonggido placement thinking youre in seoul
13 learn to eat korean food this is both a survival and a budget tip traditional korean food is cheaper and it is often healthy
14 the pressure to look good is constant and it will break you down over time better to be ready for it if youre coming here start getting into shape it sucks but itll vastly improve your quality of life
15 other teacherforeigners probably dont want to know you this seems more true for guys than girls
16 epik v hagwon is such an oversimplified discussion luck matters more than your choices for a first job here that said the longterm ceiling for epik is a better lifestyle vs hagwon which is  higher pay i wouldnt overthink the choice between the two hagwon will get you here faster if it matters
17 learn professional distance and research teaching pedagogy a bit tefl certs are not true preparation for teaching a class any real experience will be helpful behavioral management skills are typically far more important than your knowledge of english or grammar rules
18 eating out at the right place can be near the same price as cooking especially for those that dont really know how to cook or shop for groceries
19 somehow somewhere you will get screwed over it happens to everyone foreigner and korean in korea learn to take an l

theres a lot of other stuff but thats enough if youre over 30 or 40 with some life experience teaching experience and know how to budget korea is fine if youre leaving an income of over 75k cad or 60k usd definitely dont do that less than that meh youll be okay"

gyeonggi,the han commanderies issue a controversial and popular topic online used mainly by chinese and japanese nationalist trolls to claim and justify that korea and koreans are a product of the han dynasty and the chinese my two cents,"since ive seen quite a few people koreans and non koreans alike bring up the issue of han commanderies up quite often i firstly recommend you to read my posts that ive made a few years back because ive spent quite a fair bit of time debunking and deconstructing not only gija joseons historicity but also on why the han commanderies subsequently cannot be in pyongyang 

the whole premise that the han commanderies is located in pyongyang is based off of the belief that gija and his successors resided in pyongyang followed by man wiman and his succesors of which there is almost no archaeological evidence that has been verified even by japanese colonial era archaeologists because it has nothing to do with the korean peninsula to begin with

the geobody known as the korean peninsula believe it or not is first mentioned in the sanguozhi weizhi dongyizhuan from the book of wei one of the texts from the collection of the 24 histories of china in the late 3rd century ce by the historian chen shou prior to that its even doubtful that the han dynasty inhabitants let alone court even knew the existence of the korean peninsula let alone the japanese islands another point to raise is that wa or wae is quite often conflated with japan during the han dynasty period but that too is quite problematic given the fact that in the book of the later han it states that the xianbei chieftain tanshihuai captured wa people to make them catch fish for his tribal confederation and the fact that wa or wae people referred to being to the east of kuaiji commandery hangzhou zhejiang province in southeastern china its only in the book of wei that wae refers to the people residing in kyushu island notably himiko 

the han commanderies were in western liaoning and eastern hebei provinces not in pyongan hwanghae hamgyeong gangwon and gyeonggi provinces that has become consensus since the japanese colonial period in the 1910s 

firstly when lelang commandery which was allegedly claimed to be in pyongyang since the 15th to 16th century ce by joseon literati like han baek gyeom and later on by jeong yak yong who believed in the historicity of gija coming to the korean peninsula that was the fundamental basis of the invented historical tradition that gave the justification for neo confucian ideology in medieval korea lelang commandery is in fact described in much earlier chinese geography texts most notably the shujing sugyeong from the han dynasty period 206 bce  220 ce to be where the jieshi mountain the eastern end of the great wall and the pae pei river meet at one point 

li tao yuan a 6th century ce geographer of the northern wei conflated goguryeos pyongyang which was in liaoyang liaoning province with the han commandery of lelang which was why in his shujingzhu sugyeongju he claimed that the pei river flowed in a southwesterly direction into the sea which again was not based on an independent survey of the geography of that area but asking questions and extrapolating based on his brief interview with a goguryeo envoy that visited the northern wei court at the time

  
if pyongyang is where lelang commandery was well clearly jieshi mountain is supposed to be all over the way in north korea which means qin shi huangdi han wudi cao cao sui yangdi and tang taizong all went up a mountain in northwest korea and left their poetry and writing inscribed on the slopes of the mountains unfortunately for both japanese imperialists and chinese revisionists jieshi mountain is all over way thousands of kilometers to the west in qinhuangdao city to the east of beijing

since about 1987 you begin to see geography texts from the peoples republic of china by a chinese geographer tan qixiang showing the eastern end of the great wall going beyond shanhaiguan pass in qinhuangdao firstly to dandong liaoning province then all the way to mudanjiang heilongjiang province and other times all the way to the south of pyongyang pyongan province this is based on the fact that imanishi ryu and tsuda soukichi claimed that the eastern end of the great wall reached pyongyang or south of that so that it would satisfy the conditions of pyongyang being where lelang commandery is obviously they have found and have not yet validated any remains of the great wall stretching into the korean peninsula so far which is why the chinese great wall claims are bogus

  
additionally the pei river according to other earlier han dynasty texts from the 1st century ce such as the shuowen jiezi seolmoon haeja which is said to flow in a southeasterly direction into the sea all the rivers on the western side of the korean peninsula flow either in a westerly direction or southwesterly direction into the yellow sea the only rivers that flow in a southeasterly direction are in the eastern coast of the korean peninsula but unfortunately you find no lelang artefacts or evidence of han dynasty settlements in the eastern part of the korean peninsula more so than the western part thats why the pei river cannot be in pyongan hwanghae gyeonggi let alone even liaoning province the only closest rivers that flow in a southeasterly direction are in hebei province such as the daling river luan river hai river or chaobai river thats why the pei river is not the taedong river or chongchon river as tsuda or imanishi claimed over 100 years ago

  
thirdly there have been recently translated excerpts of the diaries of sekino tadashi and other japanese officials in the chosen colonial government at the time from the 1910s to 1920s by the inha university gojoseon research institute and it actually talks about them visiting the antiques market in beijing to purchase han dynasty artefacts for the lelang display museum in pyongyang dr moon seong jae who was formerly at inha university gojoseon research institute has done quite an extensive job translating and discussing all these in detail in his 2016 book the han commanderies were in china unfortunately you have some academic at the university of helsinki called andrew miles logie who appears to have conflict of interest with ties to the confucius institute at the university of helsinki trying to argue that anyone who puts forward the argument that the han commanderies were not in the korean peninsula are nationalist pseudohistorians in fact ive never seen him ever deconstruct this evidence despite claiming to diagnose and debunk pseudohistory his phd dissertation as well as his recent publications are unfortunately a bunch of ad hominem and strawman attacks often aimed exclusively against korean heterodox scholarship that never properly grapple with these arguments but try to attack the alleged ethno nationalist character or persona of scholars with opposing views 

  
fourthly jeong in bo who was a historian in colonial era korea during the 1920s to 1940s before disappearing during the korean war refuted japanese claims of having found the jeomjaehyeon stele in the middle of a field in pyongyang and finding hundreds of stamp seals of the governors of various commanderies that were allegedly excavated from lelang tombs the gist of the counterarguments put forward by jeong was that prior to the 4th and 5th centuries ce there were no steles erected but rather inscriptions were etched into the side of mountains such as what qin shi huangdi and han wudi did when they went up mt jieshi in hebei province some 2100 to 2200 years ago the fact that a 1st century bce stele would exist and be found in the middle of a field that was coincidentally found by sekino tadashi is not only suspicious because its an anachronistic find 

moreover the reason why jeong cast high doubt on the seals of the governors was not only the sheer number that they found which you dont even find in major cities such as luoyang and xian that were han dynasty capitals as well as satellite cities within the han empire at the time but also because there are anachronistic titles that simply did not exist a good example is that the governor of lelang commandery during the han dynasty was called lelang taishou whereas during the shortlived xin dynasty during wang mangs reign in the 1st century ce lelang was changed to lexian and a taishou governor was called a dayun some of the seals excavated say lelang dayun and lexian taishou which clearly shows that it is a forgery whilst if they only found lelang taishou and lexian dayun exclusively it would hold more credibility 

its also bizarre that they find very little ban liang or wu zhu cash currency that was used by the qin han cao wei and western jin dynasties in north korea even though a major epicentre of han commerce and settlement was in pyongyang you can find hordes of roman coins in england france spain portugal switzerland romania greece turkey egypt algeria morocco libya israel palestine syria lebanon and elsewhere that were formerly roman empire territories but you hardly find anything of similar quantity in north korea you have to wonder why when you do in guangdong fujian jiangxi anhui hubei hunan jiangsu zhejiang shaanxi shanxi shandong hebei and henan provinces

fifthly in 1993 in jinzhou city western liaoning province a farmer found the seal of the lintun commandery easternmost of the four han commanderies governor in a vineyard which was reported to the archaeological teams at liaoning and jilin universities at the time professor bok gi dae at inha university gojoseon research institute was a phd student at the time when he actually visited that place and this appeared in a news report in mbc way back in 1997 he published this finding in a korean archaeological journal but korean historians or archaeologists did not respond to it because they too blindly hold onto the preestablished consensus for the past 100 or so years some people have spent decades building a career based on this japanese colonial archaeologicalhistorical framework that they have too much to lose if they overturn this which is why quite often they attack people who deviate from the status quo 

sixthly in 2014 they found the tomb of a lelang commandery inhabitant han hyeon do in a district in beijing that was being renovated to build a new set of apartment buildings from the 5th to 6th centuries ce this stirred a lot of controversy both in china and korea because according to the status quo historical narrative the han commandery of lelang was supposedly destroyed in 313 ce by goguryeo during micheon of goguryeos reign this is incorrect micheon of goguryeo never destroyed lelang commandery if you read the samguk sagi or the 24 histories of china in fact lelang commandery was only extinguished in the mid 5th century ce after the northern wei and goguryeo that were in a marriage alliance divided the northern yan state that was ruled by the feng family which happens to be in an area spanning western liaoning and eastern hebei province 

subsequently you would have people raise the lelang commandery transfer theory from pyongyang to qinhuangdao which is quite a popular claim that was first coined by imanishi ryu to claim that lelang commandery was in pyongyang from 108 bce to 313 ce before being moved all the way to qinhuangdao when zhang tong a chieftain of the lelang inhabitants took 2000 residents all the way to pyongyang and then defected to the murong xianbei ruled northern yan state in qinhuangdao hebei province where a replacement lelang commandery was established across a span of 2000 to 3000 kilometres mind you even in the 17th century ce when park ji won a joseon era diplomat set out from seoul to beijing it took them 6 months to travel that distance when roads were better developed than 1300 years earlier during the western jin dynasty goguryeo would have surely intercepted zhang tong before he escaped to qinhuangdao from pyongyang if lelang was really in pyongyang but they did not you have to wonder why well the answer is simple because lelang commandery was not in the korean peninsula and the murong xianbei northern yan state never controlled any part of the korean peninsula as we all know these events all happened in hebei province which is why zhang tong and the escape of 2000 inhabitants from lelang which was a border facing region between goguryeo and the northern yan was feasible and without difficulty or being captured

its quite ironic but chinese often complain about japanese imperialism but are more than ready to use japanese colonial imperialist historiography when it suits their agenda thats why chinese complaints about japanese imperialism come across as disingenuous in my eyes considering their new revisionist historiography vis a vis korea is not only based on sinocentrism chinese chauvinism but also japanese imperialist historiography"
gyeonggi,jamboree organizers have sent hosts on a wild goose chase asking them to prepare for imaginary guests from yemen syria and sudan hosts prepared halal dishes and removed pork from packed lunches to meet islamic dietary requirements  only to find out that these guests did not exist,"it seems that the jamboree organizers are working with an outdated list of attendees that includes countries that ultimately decided not to send their members to south korea  coincidentally such countries happen to be from the wartorn regions of the middle east and north africa  sudan yemen and syria

however some members of the organizing committee are still under the impression that guests from these countries are in south korea  they are not  and its increasingly taxing the resources of the civil servants and university officials in other jurisdictions to confirm they do not exist the wellmeaning hosts that volunteered to house and feed islamic jamboree guests are being given wrong marching orders

x200b

 hyejeon university in hongseong south choongcheong province was asked to house and feed 175 members of the yemeni contingent  so they prepared catered middle eastern meals which cost them north of krw 2000000 us 1500  but the guests never showed and the hosts had to figure out from their own investigation that the yemeni delegation did not exist

x200b

 nh in the city of goyang gyeonggi is nonghyeopnhs leadership retreat for the firms securities and investment subsidiary  nh was assigned 80 members from the syrian contingent or thats what the organizers told nh  nhs corporate officers and 10 members of goyangs city officials waited until 11pm but no one from syria showed  it was only then they were told by the organizers that the assignment has been canceled  no explanation given  was there ever a syrian contingent from the wartorn country that even contemplated attending the jamboree  no idea

now its come to light that tongwon university in gwangju gyeonggi province was told they had been assigned 56 members of the sudanese delegation  sudan  first yemen then syria and now sudan which is another wartorn region of the greater middle east which includes northeast africa  well sudan does have a scout organization so it could be true that at one point they may have entertained coming to the korean jamboree  but ultimately they never traveled to south korea

well guess what tongwon university did though upon being assigned the nonexistent sudanese delegation the universitys administrators coordinated with civil servants from gwangjus city hall and brought in food safety officials policemen and firemen as anyone from sudan should be handled with tlc given the countrys precarious geopolitical situation  these officials inspected the dorms bathrooms and common areas for safety in particular they swept the areas to ensure there are no hidden cameras or av devices implanted by prior tenants  they also prepared packed lunches for the sudanese and ensured they are completely free of pork  which meant no spam which koreans cant get enough of  the organizers actually had told them that the sudanese may arrive early  so the hosts had their welcome mats out and waited for their bus to arrive starting at 3pm  they waited until 1am when they found out that the sudanese do not exist they are not in south korea

jinan technical high school in jinan made its dormitory available to the organizers  jinan is in the northeast region of north joella about 35km south of moojoo this is another location in north joella that had competed to host this years jamboree only to lose out to saemangeum in 2017  jinans officials were told they were assigned 120 members of the egyptian contingent  the officials met to discuss among themselves how to host islamic guests and started by cleaning the dormitory and purchasing 800 worth of new toiletries trash bins toothbrushes bars of soap etc   then they considered ways of meeting the egyptians dietary requirements  jinan is a city of only 24000 so they contacted caterers experienced in making halal dishes in jeonju 650000 and iksan 300000

they were told that the egyptians will arrive at 4pm  of course they did not show  this time however the egyptian contingent actually did exist what a friggin miracle  the bus driver had taken them to a wrong destination howon university in kunsan which is 90km west of jinan

wtf happened  well any bus driver in the area would know joellado like the back of his hand he wont confuse jinan for kunsan  they dont even sound alike  its evident that the organizers mixed up the destination and no one on the bus certainly not the egyptians would have known they are being sent to the wrong location  nonetheless howon university happened to have spaces available and took them in and the bus driver had already driven away the egyptians decided to stay where they were dropped off

gyeonggi,why are train workers on strike an explanation from a guy who really like trains,"korail is on strike right now and it has led to numerous cancellation in trains

things are more interesting to look at when you know what the strike is about so short explanation i guess

x200b

workers union demands are better pay better worker rotation and allowing ktx to depart from suseo station

the last demand is the main reason for the strike and what got the attention of all the rail fans in korea

suseo station opened in 2016 with the start of srt and start of competition between korail and srcompany responsible for running srt

previously all trains were managed by korail sr was created with huge government support because korail wasnt pulling enough dough thing is all lower class trains except for ktx arent profitable but korail cant just cancel their trains or mark the prices up for lower class trains because that would basically cut off some people in society from traveling government subsides will keep korail from going out of bushiness but they cannot rely on it forever

seeing this korail decided to increase their ktx price instead this opened up whole new problems now some people in the government got thinking

so we open a new rail company that exclusively run high speed trains so korail has some competition and theyll keep their prices downignore the fact that korail is forced to allocate income ktx is making to lower class trains

this may have worked if sr wasnt super dependent on korail

x200b

relationship between korail and sr

korail and sr are technically in competition but korail owns 41 of sr

sr runs srt but majority of srt are pulled from ktx trains that korail had and rebranded to srt theyre on a long term lease but the price korail is charging for the lease is absurdly cheap

sr has exclusive rights to use suseo station meaning they soak up all the demands from southeast regions of seoulincluding gangnam and east regions of gyeonggi

and the deal korail and sr made says in case theres an accident and srts are unable to perform normal operations korail has to cover for us using their ktx

so yeah in competition

x200b

so why is ktx trying to get into suseo and is this worth a strike

suseobusan high speed line is a major cash cow in korean trains sr while still has a significant amount of debt is pulling in steady profit from these lines while korails debt is getting higher and higher

last year powerline near suseo station experinced a failure making few srt train inoperable bound by an agreement ktx trains pulled into suseo station korean rail community got loads of pictures on that day however this brought the debate on why is korail covering for srs issues and why cant we run both ktx and srt from suseo all the time

few months later sr announced theyll be operating independently from korail korail responded to this by so if youre really independent you know all the trains youve borrowed from us we want them back then sr backed down by saying were making more trains so were using your trains until theyre finished

but what really set the strike going was expansion of srs network srt trains increased their coverage to new lines but remember they only have limited number of trains this raised some eyebrows as that means less srt trains will be running on high demand route and those routes always get sold out 23 days before departure during peak hours sr responded to this saying there will be no change in train schedule

in reality they kept the schedule same but slashed the trains in half srt during peak hours run as multi trains meaning two different trains will be joined by couplers so theyll act as one train but have twice the capacity sr basically took out half of their multi trains and run them as single trains and get the remaining trains to the new line

immediately frequent users of trains didnt like what the sr was doing daegu and busan which majority of these trains go to didnt like this either rail union saw this and thought nows the chance their logic does make sense though if sr is running less frequently from suseo station let ktx fill the gaps and korail will be able to fix the debt problem by profits from suseo

so yeah thats where we are"

gyeonggi,driving in seoul,calling all drivers im looking for your honest opinions on driving in seoul ive had my license for a little over a year i never learned in my own country so all my experience is here im a later learner mid 30s i drive daily its semiterrifying for me still but manageable and i only drive in the quieter areas of gyeonggi such as yongin gwangju etc so my question is how does driving in seoul compare am i ready do i need 10 more years under my belt and should just stick to public transport for my seoul plans the only reason im contemplating the car is because it will shave an hour off my travel time but if fellow drivers feel it will cause me lifelong trauma ill make the longer trip on transport
gyeonggi,local places not many tourists know about ,"i am a foreigner trying to make my time here worth while i will be living here for 2 years i have only been here 1 month so i am trying to familiarize myself with the tourist areas and areas the locals love to go too i am not in anyway trying to draw any unwanted attention to the spots since they arent touristy still trying to navigate with naver i am in the pyongtaek city gyeonggi do area if that helps also willing to travel tia

gyeonggi,koreans need to assimilate with the japanese people as soon as possible  this is also the path to our boundless happiness as koreans said imperial army veteran  in 1943 memoir who became minister of national defense of south korea and is now buried with honors at seoul national cemetery,"as koreans we have been given the new mission of becoming subjects of imperial japan uniting completely with the yamato japanese people focusing on japan to develop protect and nurture east asia to fully fulfill our mission of sweeping away the gloomy atmosphere of today and achieving renewal it is imperative that we assimilate with the yamato people as soon as possible and become completely like them there is no other way this is also the path to our boundless happiness as koreans

lieutenant colonel hirayama hoei aka shin taeyounghttpspreviewreddita3px4zvlzy6d1jpgwidth599formatpjpgautowebpsc0f1ae7d57123dc49a31cbc39121e90f898e15ba

this quote is from a 1943 memoir written below by a prominent korean collaborator who was in the imperial army for over three decades rising up to become lieutenant colonel in the imperial army by the 1940s and then somehow became lieutenant general in the south korean army and minister of national defense of south korea in 1952 and was eventually buried with honors in the seoul national cemetery

it seems baffling and absurd to me that someone who explicitly pledged allegiance to imperial japan and renounced his korean identity could become a highranking government official of the republic of korea and be honored at its national cemetery in the memoir the future south korean minister declares that koreans need to assimilate with the japanese people and become completely like them he describes how he transformed from a pure korean into a fullyfledged yamato person during his decadeslong career in the imperial japanese army the entire memoir reads like a long passionate love letter to imperial japan where his disdain for the korean nation and his korean ancestors is quite palpable so why is he still honored at south koreas national cemetery alongside the graves of korean independence activists

there is one korean news articlehttpsnnewsnavercommnewsarticle4690000409460sid102 that discusses this very issue and one korean journalist posted a youtube videohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgxtp9bg9zo of himself visiting the actual grave of the collaborator at the cemetery expressing his disgust at the situation angry comments on the video call for the grave to be dug up but the video has barely gained any traction online garnering just over four thousand views in four years the korean media seem to be aware of the existence of this memoir in the colonial newspaper but the actual text of the memoir had not been transcribed or translated beyond the headlines until now

the author of the memoir was shin taeyoung  his original korean name or hirayama hoei  his adopted japanese name it was published on the front page of the november 17 1943 evening edition of keijo nippo the national newspaper of colonial korea and a propaganda mouthpiece of the imperial japanese colonial regime that ruled korea from 1905 to 1945 the colonial newspaper dedicated over half of the front page to this memoir indicating the importance the colonial regime attached to it to reach as many korean readers as possible

in his memoir hirayama describes how he trained and served as an officer in the imperial japanese army for three decades recounting the hardships he endured to fully assimilate into japanese culture and prove his loyalty to imperial japan he advocates for military training in korean schools to instill japanese spirit and discipline reflecting the views of other ethnic korean imperial army officers like him including south korean dictator park chunghee he saw the japanization of the korean nation as the only way to revitalize it and counteract the perceived cultural and ideological decay among the korean people

can you think of any other instance where a person renounces their ancestral country in writing and through service with a military of a foreign country that tried to erase their ancestral country then later becomes a government official and highranking military official of that same ancestral country and is buried with honors in its national cemetery to me it seems quite paradoxical and unjustifiable

note yamato people refers to ethnic japanese people throughout the memoir there is a second part to this memoir which was published on november 18 1943 in which hirayama mainly goes on to scold korean families for being reluctant to send their sons off to war and severely criticizes the confucian values of korean culture if there is interest i will attempt to decipher and publish it online

translation

gyeongseong ilbo keijo nippo november 17 1943

memoir by imperial army lieutenant colonel hirayama hoei an ethnic korean part 1

korean students do you not want to feel life and live it to its fullest

grasp the iron will

the destination of our first expedition was yasukuni shrine

recently the temporary recruitment regulations for special army volunteers in korea were issued which gave me the occasion to look back on the past and observe the present as i did so something filled me with deep emotion i sighed with relief feeling both reassurance and satisfaction yet at the same time i harbored secret worries

as an officer of the imperial japanese army reflecting on the situations and experiences i have encountered over thirty years of military life i compare todays circumstances and discover a vast light for the future of the korean peninsula my thirty years of effort and hope crystallized from my blood have not gone in vain now before my eyes they have materialized bringing unparalleled honor and pride to our peninsula will the modern korean youth properly reflect on the past squarely face the present circumstances feel this honor and firmly grasp this light will they eagerly come forward as if to say they have been waiting for this moment and volunteer without exception this is my concern i observed their general behavior with the greatest expectation and interest

it was a long time ago in 1908 when i crossed over to japan with great hope and ambition leaving my homeland behind for the first time to study in the imperial army it was right after the russojapanese warhttpsenwikipediaorgwikirussojapanesewar korean politics were extremely chaotic the general level of cultural maturity was very low and the thoughts of the general public were confused and unsettled moreover the atmosphere between japan and korea was genuinely gloomy casting a shadow over koreas future

in such an environment my 17 classmates and i along with 26 students from the next batch of students aspired to the imperial army and crossed over east to japan to study at the imperial army cadet school of these comrades ten returned home influenced by the times and the ideological turmoil while the remaining stayed and graduated in the first batch in 1914 during the fifth year of koreas annexationhttpsenwikipediaorgwikijapane28093koreatreatyof1910 our group of 13 and the following years 20 graduates totaled 33 we were assigned to various divisions nationwide as apprentice officers and in december of the same year our group of 13 was commissioned alongside our fellow japanese graduates

our treatment in the military was absolutely nondiscriminatory the guidance from our superiors was extremely kind and meticulous our colleagues interacted with us with the utmost sincerity and our subordinates willingly obeyed us from their hearts at that time this treatment of koreans was an extraordinary privilege and an extreme honor however beneath the surface there were many other viewpoints questions lingered such as whether these koreans who had studied in the empire and become officers truly possessed the yamato japanese spirit fully demonstrated it and could risk their lives in actual combat could they train japanese soldiers

the military has many classified matters would they demonstrate the military spirit and faithfully protect these secrets such concerns were deeply latent accordingly we faced many trials depending on the circumstances reflecting quietly on these events it was natural given that japan and korea had only just unified and the general level of cultural maturity was still very low with the thoughts of hte people not yet unified however humans are emotional beings it is normal for them not to consider the natural course of events as natural i too did not voice it but felt much distress and discomfort in my heart given our situation at that time it could be said that it was also natural to feel this way



however when i began to think calmly i realized that the state korea had fallen into was not our fault this was all the fault of our ancestors nor was it japans fault far from being at fault japan had actually saved korea if japans hand had not reached out korea would have inevitably fallen into the hands of either russia the united states or britain this conclusion led me to discover a causal connection and to firmly consolidate my belief

we were born in korea a corner of east asia with an ancient history and a high culture living as a large unique community as koreans however for many years our nation had been ignorant of the trends of the world becoming superficially ostentatious and weak internally corrupt to the extreme we were destined to be swallowed up by russia the united states or britain sooner or later if that had happened far from being an officer of imperial japan i would now be a slave of those nations if i didnt become their slave it is doubtful whether i could have even survived

how could that have been acceptable japan and korea are of the same civilization and race moreover japan possesses a national polity unrivaled in the world having shaped a history of three thousand years the mission entrusted to the japanese people as human beings is to use their godgiven abilities to the fullest on the stage of east asia contributing to the development of human culture especially the welfare and progress of the east asian peoples as koreans we have been given the new mission of becoming subjects of imperial japan uniting completely with the yamato people focusing on japan to develop protect and nurture east asia to fully fulfill our mission of sweeping away the gloomy atmosphere of today and achieving renewal it is imperative that we assimilate with the yamato people as soon as possible and become completely like them there is no other way this is also the path to our boundless happiness as koreans

to achieve this todays koreans must fully embody the spirit of the imperial way possessing the complete japanese spirit and demonstrating the ability to act as imperial people i now having the opportunity to become an officer of the empire recognize my mission is not just to fulfill my responsibilities as an officer but also to shoulder the responsibilities of all koreans



i am now being tested at an extraordinary crossroads my every move as an officer of the empire directly reflects the future of all koreans i must be a fullyfledged yamato person and set a splendid example demonstrating that there are koreans who have become yamato and instilling the belief that koreans can also become yamato people my belief is that if i can do this the gloomy atmosphere of today will be swept away and a clear air will prevail

for thirty years i have lived a bloodsoaked life of effort striving to cultivate my character as a yamato person working to complete my given duties and enlightening my fellow koreans especially the younger generation if a japanese person studied for one hour i studied for five or ten hours when i thought the tasks assigned to me were too heavy compared to my abilities i worked tirelessly to complete them forgetting both rest and food for me it was more about the efficient use of time than about talent for more than twenty years i formed a family but i had no time to look after it that has been my life

even if i write these things the true hardship and effort involved are unimaginable to anyone but myself who has experienced and carried them out becoming a complete yamato person as a korean is not easy in the summer of 1918 i was promoted to lieutenant three years and eight months after being commissioned as a second lieutenant a month later i received orders for mobilization and was sent to siberiahttpsenwikipediaorgwikisiberianintervention it was my first deployment the time had come to demonstrate my dignity as both an officer of the empire and a korean a soldier must face actual combat to prove his worth it is only after experiencing the baptism of bullets that a persons true value is revealed no matter how much a korean born to ancestors who had drifted into superficiality and decay claims to possess the pure yamato spirit and to be japanese without actual achievements and evidence who would trust them

this onceinalifetime opportunity allowed me to prove that i a koreanborn person could truly grasp the yamato spirit and be pure japanese however i did have personal concerns my father had passed away half a year before my graduation from the military academy leaving only my mother and one younger brother at home since my commission i had only returned home once on leave and i had no idea about the state of my household there were many unresolved matters that only i could handle the number of family issues remaining was considerable



i was called by my regimental commander and i went to his office

he told me you are to be deployed soon if there is anything regarding your family or any other matter do not hesitate to tell me after you leave i will handle it if possible so feel free to speak up

what a deeply compassionate thing to say i was moved to tears from the bottom of my heart however i thought to myself quietly there were things that could only be settled by myself yet i was now departing by imperial command moreover this was the time to prove my japanese identity as a korean now was not the time to be concerned with trivial household matters thinking this i firmly replied there is nothing i will gladly go to yasukuni shrinehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiyasukunishrine i see then im counting on you he said



i landed in busan and headed for siberia through manchuria passing through korea felt like a fateful journey i was overwhelmed with various emotions due to the railroad transport arrangements i stayed in busan for two nights without any specific duties at home i had only my elderly mother and a younger brother

in the summer of 1915 the year following my commission i was granted a tenday leave to return home since then i had not been back for three years from then on i would only meet my family at yasukuni shrine i wished i could have departed a day earlier to bid them a final farewell i wanted to embrace my mother firmly and if possible nurse like an infant one last time i wanted to look at her face to not forget it this very thought made my heart break such feelings are felt by japanese and koreans alike perhaps japanese people might feel them even more strongly however i thought to myself i am representing koreans in my first expedition

if i mentioned that i wanted to leave early people might criticize us koreans by saying that koreans are too attached to their families and fear for their lives i had to be very careful so i said nothing i only sent a letter to my brother asking him to bring our mother to yongsan station when i passed through i spent a night in busan the next day around noon i received a sudden phone call from the station it was from another officer in my company the gist of the call was as follows

the officer asked the battalion commander lieutenant shins my surname at the time was shin family is in seoul since he only has his mother left why not let him leave a day early to see her the battalion commander responded i had never considered that a passenger train is departing soon if he comes to greet me he will miss the departure time so let him skip the customary greeting and have him leave immediately have him meet his family at yongsan station at midnight tomorrow so his orders were that i depart immediately



since this was what i had hoped for i had no reason to hesitate given my superiors permission i left immediately and went to seoul i was able to see my mother for about ten hours with that i felt at ease i felt ready to go to yasukuni shrine at any time

at the time even matters that might seem trivial from a human perspective required koreans to make a special determined effort so understandably you can imagine how much hardship koreans must have had to endure to become japanese thirty years ago i went to siberia and fought for two years i am ashamed to say that i did not achieve significant military accomplishments but i did not act cowardly i upheld the spirit of an imperial officer and maintained the dignity of the korean people after two years i returned home the atmosphere within the military became more positive however i could not remain sitting on my laurels given the situation in korea at that time koreans still needed to put in a lot of effort i got married and as children came one after another my perspective on life underwent a significant change

although the initial destination of my first expedition was yasukuni shrine for better or for worse i returned alive without going there but from then on i felt like i was not truly living i had already died in siberia i was already a skeleton a dead person should not have sensations whether i am twisted or pinched nothing should hurt naturally there should be no sensations of suffering sleepiness or hunger i worked with that kind of mindset of a dead man this was for imperial japan and for korea



though the term internal harmony between japan and korea was popular the path ahead was still long the shadow remained dark there were still grievances and dissatisfaction even in the military aside from the 13 of us and the 20 officers from the next class no successors were produced ten years after my commission part of the military service law was amended allowing for the establishment of a volunteer conscription system for koreans talented students from korea who passed the entrance exams were admitted to military cadet schools officer schools and other military institutions

thinking back after six years of studying in the imperial army and ten years of serving my efforts had finally started to bear fruit bringing light to the korean peninsula what a moving moment it was i had always believed that the best way for koreans to become true yamato people and live with unwavering conviction was to join the military



i believe it was around 1929 or 1930 before the manchurian incidenthttpsenwikipediaorgwikimukdenincident one day i was called by the regimental commander and went to his office he presented me with a document it asked is it feasible to assign active officers to schools primarily attended by korean students of at least middle school level to implement military training my superior was seeking my opinion on this matter he asked for my frank opinion in writing with no holding back

at that time the general mood of the times strongly advocated for harmony between japan and korea the educated korean class earnestly desired the implementation of compulsory education and the early introduction of conscription they submitted petitions to authorities in charge either individually or through representatives and even traveled to the central government to negotiate directly

this enthusiasm from the educated korean class stemmed from a strong desire to transform the entire korean population into imperial subjects as soon as possible sweep away the gloomy atmosphere and realize true japanesekorean unification however given the low level of cultural maturity and numerous ideological considerations in korea at that time the authorities repeatedly deemed the requests too early to implement



in this context the issue of implementing military training for korean students arose i responded

given todays situation achieving true unity between japan and korea requires koreans to become imperial subjects as soon as possible to do this koreans must grasp and embody the japanese spirit as soon as possible the best way to achieve this is to implement conscription as soon as possible to instill the military spirit however it is too early to introduce conscription in korea therefore at least for now it is crucial to assign active officers to schools of at least middle school level to provide military training to instill the japanese spirit and raise a class of leaders if we keep hesitating by saying that the timing is too early when will japanesekorean unity ever be achieved there are already some koreans like me who were not born with the japanese spirit because they were originally born pure korean it is entirely thanks to military education that a previously pure korean like myself has become a japanese today from this perspective the only way to make koreans imperial subjects as soon as possible is to implement military training in schools i urge you to implement military training in schools decisively and without hesitation like cutting through tangled silk with a sharp swordhttpwwwromajidesucomdictionarymeaningofe5bfabe58880e4b9b1e9babbhtml

since the authorities had already established a policy whether my modest opinion had any effect is another matter nonetheless the following year military training was experimentally implemented at gyeonggi high school and pyongyang high school after one year seeing the positive educational effects the training was gradually extended across korea leading to what we now see today

gyeonggi,complete guide to the korean military,"there are a multitude of posts on this subreddit and on other forums and websites from overseas koreans ethnic minority korean citizens and others who are obligated to serve mandatory military service unfortunately there are quite a number of wellmeaning but misinformed people who either provide anecdotal information or information based on foreign militaries such as singapore which is a completely different system as well as those who are simply full of shit

i have compiled a summary of some of the options available to those who are liable for military service trying to focus on the options most applicable to those with experience living overseas or with limited korean skills i will try add as much as i can please feel free to correct me and ask questions i will also be trying to continue to add to this guide as much as i can

officernco 

officers require a bachelors degree from any accredited university can be from outside korea ncos require a high school diploma again can be from outside korea both require you to take an examination which is in korean and they can be quite difficult and require time at a tutorial centre  competition for both officer and nco can be very stiff and they have recruitment periods infrequently for example rok army ocs has one intake per year

interpretation officer
this is a kind of specialised officer who engages in interpretation usually korean to english but also rarely other foreign languages the test to become one is different from that of regular officers and requires extensive time at a hagwon air force interpretation officers are universally considered the best one even is assigned to the president in cheongwadae followed by navy army then marine corps

enlisted 

the korean military generally follows a method where you can either receive a draft notice  or formally a  or you can choose to serve in one of an extremely wide range of options if you receive a draft notice you will 100 serve in the army but you can ignore the notice and apply for one of the options instead most people nowadays apply for a specific vocation rather than wait for a draft notice which can take several months to arrive


army

the army has the widest options it is impossible to list all of the options and i would encourage you to find someone who is fluent in korean to go through the mma  website and look through the extremely wide range of options i have highlighted a few below

service period is 18 months or at least will be soon enough

katusa

this is a lottery process basically all katusas serve with us army forces korea after finishing rok army basic training competition is quite high about 15 acceptance rate and you can only apply once if you choose to apply have a backup plan 

special forces 

you serve in one of the special forces groups where you undergo airborne school then go on to fulfill administrative duties such as office work or perhaps pack parachutes you will not be an operator  who enlist as staff sergeantnco  in a separate process a major benefit is the airborne training parachute as well as a guarantee of where you will be posted to apply you do need a decent level of fitness including pullups but competition is not that high

interpreter 

you will have to apply and competition is quite stiff many attend tutorial centreshagwons to prepare for the exams and they require a high level of both korean and the chosen foreign  language english french arabic japanese etc  while some interpreters in the air forcemarines are picked during basic training do not think that just because you are good at english that you will become an interpreter this may have been true in the past but not now

navy

it is not difficult to join the navy in general competition is not that high close to 100 acceptance rate for general shipborne duties for example

interpreters
you can also apply as a interpreter

special forces
these consist of ssu ship salvage unit and udtseals these are two elite units which recruit once a year and ssu especially has crazy high levels of competition

service period is 20 months

marine corps

while the marine corps are under the navy they recruit separately you cannot apply for both the navy and marine corps at the same time while competition used to be extremely high during the yeonpyeong island bombings period 15 now the acceptance rate is closer to 50 it is much easier if you apply to become a driver or a cook marine corps recon competition ranges from around 5 to 15 depending on the month to apply you need to take an interview so you need a basic understanding of korean and make sure to learn about basic marine corps history its mostly to weed out those who are clearly unfit for the corps as well as pushupssitups

service period is same as army 18 months

air force

the air force is considered quite easy by many and therefore quite competitive most air force recruits become military police where you guard the bases

service period is 22 months the longest

police  firefighter 

these two are quite similar so i will lump them together

competition to join police is very difficult with 5 acceptance rate in place such as seoul and gyeonggi province each province has its own different method of selection some use lottery and some interview etc many applicants travel across the country and apply in each province and city the test usually requires you to do at least 20 pushups with perfect form

auxiliary police will no longer be recruited from 2023 and firefighters from 2022

social service agent  or formally 

you cannot choose to become one but rather become one by getting the lowest grade 4  in the physical and mental examination you take at the mma  called  or formally  a very small number of people do cheat to try to get this classification by overeating swallowing foreign objects etc some of these social service agents first go through army basic training at nonsan some do not"
gyeonggi,everyday christmas a bread buffet located in ilsan,"are you surprised by the high price of bread in korea 

bread is not cheap because it is consumed as dessert not as a staple food for koreans 

plus the cost of coffee and beverages is considerable would you be interested in the information on restaurants that offer unlimited bread for about 99007 including tax


everyday christmas a bread buffet located in ilsangu goyangsi gyeonggido the restaurants detailed location is on the 9th floor of the new core department store near madu station line3


is gyeonggi province too far for you staying in seoul well isnt it time rather than money that you have enough while traveling its a pity that foreigners living in much larger areas than korea reduce their physical activity and lock themselves up in a small area near their accommodation when they come to korea


 tips for everyday christmas 


1 opening hours buffet operating hours 10301330 daily
visit in time for the 1030 opening 
after 1330 the operation of the buffet will end and be operated as a general bakery cafe 


2 9900 won including unlimited bread dessert coffee or drink

this price surprises everyone a cup of blue bottle latte in korea costs 6600 won use coffee unlimited bread and desserts however for 70 minutes


3 foods

 soup salad pasta toast sandwich cheese trendy bread dessert jams mini cakes fruit

when the serving bread tray is empty it is replaced with new breads 



4 dont leave anything behind there is a penalty


5 choose 5 breads and coffee for takeaway for 9900 won

available personally i prefer to takeaway 5 breads i want with coffee and go to a nearby lake park to enjoy the scenery and eat slowly

 from this building to ilsan lake park its less than a 10minute walk

gyeonggi,south korea travel itinerary help please,"hi i would really appreciate some advice

i am coming to seoul on june 24th i am thinking of staying in incheon then seoul possibly guri namyanju and possibly gyeonggido if it is worth going to i am also thinking of going on the south korea  north korea dmz tour 

i would really appreciate your opinion"
gyeonggi,korean candidate defiantly ran for office in 1943 seoul elections without imperial japans endorsement only to be forced to drop out and thank master imaizumi for soothing his dissatisfaction with the world and making him realize that the regime was the right way,"this 1943 article was published in the keijo nippo the official newspaper and propaganda organ of the imperial japanese colonial regime which ruled over korea from 1905 to 1945 this article illustrates one example of the manipulation and control tactics which colonial authorities employed on the korean population detailing the story of mr kanemitsu likely originally mr kim a member of the seoul prefectural assembly during the japanese colonial period it portrays his initial decision to run for office only to withdraw his candidacy later the backstory likely involves mr kanemitsu kim committing what the colonial regime viewed as a grave sin running for office without receiving an endorsement from the official nomination system of the colonial regime his candidacy supported by many sympathetic koreans hoping for positive changes likely posed a significant challenge to the colonial authorities

mr kanemitsu right standing with his teacher bearded master imaizumi lefthttpspreviewreddit5ncvjz93dlzc1jpgwidth696formatpjpgautowebpse75a7ad13a565eedb26dd794c0d3394a0c613b59

mr kanemitsu could have suffered severe repercussions for his grave sin ranging from imprisonment to worse however his popularity and support among the koreans probably led to a negotiated settlement the regime realizing the advantages of coopting rather than crushing him might have offered to drop charges in exchange for his withdrawal from the election and his endorsement in this article calling upon fellow koreans to embrace the teachings of master imaizumi a prominent spiritual leader propagated by the regime to instill loyalty and obedience among the koreans the published story framed his decision to drop out as influenced by a lifechanging encounter with master imaizumi see this earlier posthttpswwwredditcomrkoreacomments105sc9cmasterimaizumiteisukethespiritualleaderof which explores keijo nippos coverage of master imaizumi and his preaching tour through korea in 1942

this article likely aimed not only to discourage similar acts of defiance but also to reinforce the regimes ideological dominance by showcasing mr kim as a model korean who humbly submitted to imperial authority it exemplifies how the regime used media to control the narrative suppress dissent and maintain its power over the korean populace

master imaizumi teisuke who is depicted as converting mr kim into a loyal imperial subject was a towering figure in the landscape of shinto theology and a pivotal figure in the colonial regimes efforts to justify and solidify their rule over korea as a prominent shinto theologian his lifes work centered around kokugakuhttpsenwikipediaorgwikikokugaku a nativist movement that valorized japans ancient shinto traditions while rejecting foreign influences like christianity buddhism and chinese philosophy

by the time of his 12day lecture tour in korea in 1942 imaizumi was an 80yearold man with a flowing white beard embodying the image of an ancient sage his long life had spanned the radical transformation of japan from a feudal society into a formidable empire his rigorous defense of japans ancient customs and shinto roots made him a revered figure with his words often seen as gospel truth by the colonial rulers in korea

during his lectures in korea imaizumi portrayed japanesekorean unification in starkly paternalistic termscomparing it to the relationship between a husband and wife or a horse and its rider and later as between a parent and child these analogies while paternalistic and demeaning by todays standards were aimed at reinforcing the colonial hierarchy and legitimizing japanese dominance his speeches extensively covered in the keijo nippo reveal the religious and ideological zealotry that underpinned japans colonial policy including the forceful imposition of state shintoism on the korean populace

despite being the grand spiritual leader of imperial japan master imaizumi apparently experienced a dramatic fall from grace sometime between 1943 and 1944 because his death on september 11 1944 was marked by a notably perfunctory obituary reflecting his diminished stature today his works are no longer in print and have faded into obscurity largely forgotten even among japanese neoimperialists this decline in relevance could partly be attributed to his political outspokenness against the wartime policies of the imperial japanese military though these critical comments led to censorship of his works precise details of his criticisms are scant and remain a subject for further research

translation

gyeongseong ilbo keijo nippo may 9 1943

i made a mistake by running for office

preparing to sever bonds with friends he withdrew gracefully

he was guided by the teachings of master imaizumi

as previously reported on may 6th mr kanemitsu satoshi 40 years old the current member of the seoul prefectural assembly from 44 yeongdeungpodong had intended to run in the upcoming seoul prefectural assembly election on may 21st with the encouragement of many of his close supporters however before filing for his candidacy he came to know the significance of the nomination system and realized that running for office as a free candidate during wartime could disrupt the solid unity between the government and the people despite desperate pleas from his close supporters he visited gyeonggi province on may 7 and having resolved to even sever ties with old friends he announced his decision not to stand as a free candidate impressing the officials present

mr kanemitsu was elected as a member of the gyeonggi provincial assembly in 1937 and he greatly contributed to his district by founding sinheung school and yeongchang school and by serving as the head of the local defense group the development of mr kanemitsus profound nationalistic ideas was unexpectedly influenced by the teachings of the kokugaku scholar imaizumi teisuke who had traveled around the korean peninsula last october preaching the true essence of the national body this has led to a deeper appreciation of master imaizumis remarkable influence on which mr kanemitsu commented as follows photo master imaizumi left and mr kanemitsu

listening to master imaizumis lectures can soothe anyones dissatisfaction with the world such is the virtue of the teacher i have been his disciple for a long time and it was always a pleasure to listen to his lectures every time i visited tokyo i remember him teaching that the true essence of the national body is to return to the gods this also means that once a policy is determined as the right way by those above those below must absolutely follow and promote it

in that context even if there were some dissatisfactions with the nominated candidates i realized that standing as a free candidate would incite unnecessary competition and waste resources which would be an act against the nation therefore out of admiration for the teachers virtue i have steadfastly refused the persuasions of many acquaintances and decided against running as a free candidate it is rumored that i have already submitted my candidacy but that is certainly not the case even if i filed as a free candidate by mistake that would surely be dishonorable to master imaizumi would it not

gyeonggi,fake 25w charger,NO BODY
gyeonggi,why havent korean opted for a federaldecentralized government in its thousands year history,"i just feel like it would make more sense if koreans just opted for a more decentralized yet ethnically homogenous state because of how stubborn many koreans are in their nature they just cant seem to agree on anything a lot of the time 

ive travelled to korea for many years and despite their uniform language and food there seems to be pretty vast differences in terms of what each provinceregion needs for its own economic and cultural development korea has had a very long history of basically hating each others guts dating way back to the jin and gojoseon era and proto three kingdoms era heck id even argue that cultural remnants of these different kingdoms still remain in different parts of south koreachungcheong gyeongsang jeolla urban core of seoulgyeonggi etc and dont even get me started on cultural and economic differences between the north and south

in fact i think the process of decentralizing the korean provinces may be even more important if korea were to reunify in the distant future even if korea were to reunify gradually and safely theres no doubt the northern and south provinces will still have massive cultural differences and mindsets so why not give each province more control and autonomy perhaps a federal republic of  koreainstead of the republic of korea would be more conducive for a stable polity"

its impossible to write a concise summary of the 2018 season  you can get some of the details from the club guide below  but one of the most interesting stories actually comes from k league 2

for context you need to understand a bit about military service for footballers rather than take 2 years out of their career to serve in the military or do some kind of eg desk job service players can join one of two military football teams that play in the k league in k league 1 there is sangju sangmu and in k league 2 there is asan mugunghwa every player in these two teams is on loan for two years from another club in the k league sangju sangu is affiliated with the normal military whilst asan mugunghwa is affiliated with the police serving in the auxilliary police force is another way to do your service

the korean government recently decided to abolish the auxilliary police force by 2023 the police however decided to already wind down their sports teams putting an immediate halt on recruiting players and disbanding the teams in 2019

now the champions of k league 2 last season were asan mugunghwa they were in line for direct promotion to k league 1 to compete in the k league you need to have at least 20 players but by the time the next season started asan would only have 14 players as the loan deals ran out the league gave asan a deadline in november to submit a recruitment plan which they failed to do and so the promotion spot passed to secondplaced seongnam fc although that deadline and hence promotion was missed asan have how submitted a recruitment plan that would see their 14 serving players be supplemented by new signings that indicates the club will transition to an cityowned club with the help of the asan government

funnily or depressingly this is not the first time police fc won k league 2 and missed out on promotion  in 2016 ansan mugunghwa were crowned champions but at the end of that year moved from ansan to asan in line with the leagues policies they were registered as a brand new club

k league 1 club guide

clubs can have up to three foreign players in their squad plus an extra one from another afc nation although rare a player with north korea citizenship is not considered foreign most of those foreign places are taken by brazilians or players from the former yugoslavia eg k league veteran dejan damjanovic the exception to the foreigner rule is the goalkeeper  korean goalkeepers in the 90s were just so bad that a block on recruiting foreign goalieshttpwwwkleagueunitedcom201703foreigngoalkeepersinfavourofhtml was put in place to help encourage development of domestic talent it seems to have worked with korean goalkeepers often being signed abroad in asia at least

there is also a requirement to have u23 players fielded and on the bench with a failure to meet this impacting the number of substitutes that can be made article 30httpswwwkleaguecomaboutcompetition of the league rules

youll notice some of the clubs have a korean chaebol in their team name and even if its not in the name they may still be owned by a corporation behind the scenes this sounds very odd if youre not familiar with it but it is extremely common in japan china and korea it may just be a symptom of some of the teams being relatively recentlyfounded and perhaps isnt that unusual these days think red bull city group majority shareholders in the west however the number of citizen clubs owned by the local city or provincial government is on the rise  gyeongnam fc is one example

a lot of clubs probably like to think they have a derby with fc seoul because well its seoul but the  biggest and probably considered the national derby is the super match  between fc seoul and suwon samsung bluewings montenegrin damjanovic known simply as dejan formerly of seoul and now playing for suwon is the top scorer in this fixture

heres the clubs by last seasons standing and since crests are a bit unstable on reddit at the moment heres an imgur album of all club crests and corresponding home kits for the 2019 seasonhttpimgurcomaw8dbla5

jeonbuk hyundai motors

jeonbuk are the dominant team in korea and one the of the teams you dont want to face in the champions league whoever you are theyve now won 4 out of the last 5 k league 1 titles and a most recent champions league title in 2016

their rise to power over the last decade has been overseen by long term manager choi kanghee choi left at the end of last season to tianjin quanjintianhai daliang yifang fc in china korea seems to have a thing for portuguese managers these days and his replacement is one jos morais morais was assistant manager to jos mourinho for a period but as manager proper hes been a bit shit he was at two clubs in 2018 which included ushering barnsley into relegation to english league one how jeonbuk will fare after choi remains to be seen

although jeonbuk cruised to the league title it would be difficult to call their season an outright success due to a horrendous 15 mins at the end of the second half in a home match against suwon in the champions league quarterfinal they turned the 3 goal deficit around in the seond leg when they travelled to suwon but went out on penalties 

gyeongnam fc

gyeongnam were only promoted from k league 2 the previous season so coming second in k league 1 is something special top scorer in the league marco played his part with 26 goals

gyeongnam will now feature in the champions league for the first time i thought that seems to have put the brakes on too many of their players departing but captain choi youngjun signed for jeonbuk in the winter transfer window a major loss is marco who was also top scorer in k league 2 in the year they were promoted who appears to have followed the money to china also off to china is key centreback park jisoo so basically the backbone of the team from defence to attack has left

ulsan hyundai

known as the horangi   the tigers  ulsan have had intermittent success in asia winning the champions league for the first and only time in 2012 in an unbeaten run

towards the end of the 2018 season ulsan were battling gyeongnam for the second spot which brings with it direct qualification to the champions league group stages rather than having a playoff they lost out but were widely expected to secure a direct qualification spot anyway when they faced daegu fc in the fa cup final ultimately they finished the season on a low losing 51 on aggregate to daegu in the final 

pohang steelers

one of the few clubs that predates the formation of the k league pohang are another of the historical korean powerhouses they hold the record for the most number of champions league title 3 but their last title came in 2009

finishing fourth in the league they were hoping that ulsan would beat daegu in the fa cup final to pass their champions league spot on down but it didnt happen

jeju united

one of the original members of the k league founded as the yukong elephants in the seoul area as part of the decentralisation program they moved to bucheon kind of and were renamed as bucheon sk the decision to move to jeju in 2006 was an abrupt one and understandably deeply unpopular with the fans teams uprooting and moving elsewhere is a bit of a catalyst for the creation of new teams in korea and the fans formed bucheon fc 1995 in the absence of bucheon sk

the reason given for the relocation was to the address the imbalance in football teams being located around seoulgyeonggido and jeju did not have a pro team at the time but there are suggestions the owners sk group wanted to cut their investment and recoup some costs

there were recent rumours that jeju would move yet again back north to yongin but who knows 

jeju had a pretty mediocre season what more can i say

suwon samsung bluewings

suwons 2018 season was a bit bonkers and especially so in their champions league run

in their champions league group in which they were drawn with eventual winners kashima antlers suwon did not manage a single home win however they had managed to get two away wins and going into the final match they still had their fate in their own hands if they could win against group leaders kashima in japan they won 10 getting three away wins and topping the group

manager seo jungwon at a time when suwon were 4th in the league resigned the day before the first leg of their champions league quarterfinal clash with jeonbuk due to fan protests jeonbuk were apparently completely bamboozled by this event and took a 30 beating at home then in the return leg in suwon jeonbuk fought back to win 30 but suwon were able to scrape through on penalties to face kashima antlers yet again in the semis

in the semifinal fixture suwon went 20 up against kashima antlers inside the first 10 minutes but went on to lose 32 in the first leg
soon after manager seo returned as suddenly as he had departed having been gone for just 6 weeks  
in the second leg suwon went a goal down in the first half but came back with 3 in the second half to be on their way to the final after 60 mins played however kashima antlers fought back to get two more goals and win 65 on aggregate and would go on to win the final if you want to relive a part of that rollercoaster night here you gohttpsyoutuberxy8pagy1aq and heres an idea of the atmosphere that nighthttpstwittercomtheafcclstatus1055055104607285248

at one point it looked like they might qualify for the champions league again for the 2019 season but suwon didnt win any of their final five league matches and dropped to 6th

manager seo left again at the end of the season and will manage japans sagan tosu recently captain kim eunsun was released from the club for drinkdriving the drama just never ends

daegu fc

prior to the world cup daegu were languishing at the bottom of the table but after the return they found some kind of consistent form helped out by world cup hero goalkeeper jo hyeonwoo they really peaked at the right time as daegu made it to the fa cup final and against the odds defeated ulsan hyundai 51 on aggregate meaning for the first time they will feature in the champions league this is no mean feat for team whose best ever finish in the top flight is 7th place if they carry over their momentum into the 2019 season the year could be one of their most successful ever they will also be playing in a new footballspecific stadium this year

gangwon fc

gangwon are a fairly midbottom team i dont really know what to say about them they did have the 2ndhighest top scorer in the 2018 season though bosnian uros deric they also had the worst colour scheme in the league last season their kit is slightly improved this season

incheon united

i always like to imagine that incheon chose their strip so that they could be the inter to fc seouls ac milan they even have a nickname nerazzurri another nickname is the durumi    the cranes

incheon spent most of the 2018 season at the very bottom of table and had the jointleakiest defence in the league they brought in norwegian manager jrn andersen midway through the season to turn their fortunes around but even after that they were on the wrong end or the biggest thrashing of the season 70 against gangwon coming into the end of the season though they were playing really nice attacking football even if they didnt always get the result at the split they were still bottom but won 4 out of 5 games to pull themselves up 3 places

it was in attack that incheon shone montenegrin stefan mugosa was their top scorer in his debut season moon seonmin with the best goal celebration in the league also put in a strong performance but has now signed for champions jeonbuk nam junjae returned in the summer to score some bangers costa rican international aguilar was also impressive but has signed for jeju in the new season

sangju sangmu

the military team where other k league players get loaned to to complete their military service their history goes far back in one sense as various military teams were playing way back to the 50s but they were founded for pro footballers to serve their time only in 1984 although they were for pro players they competed in the semipro national league until 2003 when they joined the k league based in gwangju when gwangju fc were formed they moved to sangju

sangju sangmu do not have any foreign players for obvious reasons and cannot compete in the champions league although the chances of ever finishing in a qualifying spot are fairly slim

fc seoul

fc seoul wow what happened having won the league in 2016 albeit somewhat fortuitously and always finishing in the top half if not competing for the title in the past decade nobody expected seoul to be fighting against relegation although relatively solid defensively they scored the least number of goals in the league season of all teams their star foreign players almost all left before the season started including dejan to rivals suwon and were not replaced with the same quality and for many matches seoul played with an allkorean team one bit of good news for the future is that former captain osmar will return from his loan to cezero osaka for the new season

seoul at least managed to avoid relegation by beating busan ipark over two legs in the playoff helped by a red card in the first leg surprisingly they managed to score 3 goals in the first leg in open play

seoul is probably the most popular club in korea im sure helped by the fact that it is the main club in a city of 10 million people  seoul generally has the highest game attendances although it was much reduced last season because they were so crap

starting out as luckygoldstar ie lg fc in chungcheong province the team was permitted to relocate to seoul at the start of the 90s and were renamed as lg cheetahs during the decentralisation period they moved to anyang modifying their name to anyang lg cheetahs after the world cup the team successfully negotiated a move back to seoul and did away with their cheetahs moniker taking their current name fc seoul their founding and rebirth years are both on their badge  1983 and 2004

seongnam fc

gaining direct promotion due to asan mugunghwas situation seongnam is actually the most decorated team in korea

founded in 1989 in seoul as ilhwa chunma they were forced out of seoul and settled in cheonnan for a period in 2000 they moved to seongnam a satellite city of seoul and appended the city name to the name of the club seongnams title drought started when the head of the owner company that backed seongnam died in 2012 and the board were keen to let go of the club seongnam city government took over ownership of the club for the 2014 season and they were renamed seongnam fc seongnam are now back in k league 1 after a 2 year absence

k league 2 clubs

by last seasons standings

jeonnam dragons

jeonbuks jeolla province rivals they finished the previous season on an awful losing streak and were relegated for the first time

asan mugunghwa

police fc they missed promotion despite winning k league 2 and will probably lose their police affiliation by next year

busan ipark

one of the founding members of the k league and another that effectively predates the k league busan were beaten by k league 1 opposition in the prorel playoff for the second year in a row they were the first korean team to win the asian continental title in the 80s

daejeon citizen

one of the first communitycityowned clubs in korea

gwangju fc

relegated in the 2017 season despite finishing 5th in 2018 they still got to participate in the playoffs due to asan mugunghwas situation

fc anyang

founded in 2013 finally filling the void left by the departure of fc seoul from the city

suwon fc

the other suwon team they featured in k league 1 briefly in 2016

bucheon fc 1995

formed after the departure of jeju united from the city formed in 2007 1995 refers to the year of the organising of the yukong elephant fan club including 1995 in the name is meant to show its a club for the fans or something

bucheon fc 1995 are also one half of the 032 derby with incheon united because they share the same area code 032

ansan greeners fc

formed only in 2017 theyve had two 9thposition finishes

seoul eland fc

the other seoul team their debut season was in 2015 they didnt do very well last season although it was very tight at the bottom of the table

winter transfer window activity

from a monetary point of view korea is the biggest net exporterhttpsenynacokrviewaen20190131006600315sectionsportsindex of players in asia in the transfer market this winter window was no different with what i would say were the two biggest stories involving young homegrown korean talent going abroad

the first is that of jeonbuk and national team star centreback kim minjae nicknamed the monster there were rumours of an offer from english side watford but it wasnt clear if there ever was any offer or negotiations  kim himself said he did not know of any interest from watford it doesnt really matter now  kim signed with chinese side beijing sinobo guoan and will see champions league football with them in the new season being drawn in the same group as jeonbuk

the second is hwang inbeom who has signed for mls side vancouver whitecaps hwang inbeom played in k league 2 last season with asan mugunghwa and daejeon citizen but has impressed as a midfield playmaker and is currently seen as a replacement for ki sungyueng in the national team

for a recognisable name for western readers the best i have is englishman jordon mutch who signed for gyeongnam from crystal palace resulting in this awkward photo ophttpspbstwimgcommediadzg3adzvyaakrkqformatjpgnamemedium another recognisable name is mix diskerud on loan to ulsan from man city but he joined the previous year

k league 1s top scorer marco left gyeongnam for hebei china fortune and his replacement is luc castaignos signed from sporting cp his stats in europe havent been great in recent years but he may fare better in korea

there were of course a few hundred domestic internal transfers and number of other foreign player signings  if you want the full list k league uniteds winter transfer trackerhttpwwwkleagueunitedcom2019012019kleaguewintertransfertrackerhtml has it all



history of club football in korea  establishment of the k league

association football was first introduced to korea in 1882 when british royal navy crew harboured at incheon played a game it wasnt until the 1900s that football began to take hold and the first public match was played in 1905 there was a boom in in the 1910s with a number of football clubs being formed and rivalries began to form between clubs in seoul and pyongyang

the first nationwide competition was the all joseon football tournament joseon being the name for korea at the time founded in 1921 there wasnt actually a champion crowned in 1921 as the tournament was cut short due to complaints over refereeing decisions all this was taking place during japanese occupation of korea during most of the first half of the 20th century

according to the kfahttpswebarchiveorgweb20170606162658httpkfaorkrrecordhistoryasp football was the only tonic that could relieve the the national resentment that had accumlated in the hearts as a colony under the japanese empire and was a sprout that could foster the hope of freedom a tad hyperbolic maybe

one side effect of being a japanese colony is that some korean teams were allowed to participate in the emperors cup japans fa cup and in 1935 kyungsung fc kyungsung was a name for seoul during japanese occupation won the tournament becoming the only nonjapanese team to ever do so

the all joseon football tournament ran until wwii

after wwii came korean independence and shortly thereafter the korean war there was football being played during this period continuously when possible the korean national semiprofessional football league was founded in 1964 and is the predecessor to todays tier 3 national league many of the teams during this period were works teams  employed by a company playing under the name of the company but also having a proper job in the company cha bumkun said by some to be the greatest ever asian footballer rose to fame during this period albeit mainly in the bundesliga starting his senior career at the mighty seoul trust bank fc the most astonishing statistic about cha bumkun is he only received one yellow card in his career

finally we get to the establishment of professional football with the korean super league in 1983 now named the k league initially there were only 5 teams and 2 of those teams dropped out within 2 years the number of clubs in the top flight has varied from the initial 5 to a high of 16 in 2011 in 2013 the k league split into two tiers now k league 1 and k league 2

for the first few years of the k league teams did not have a fixed home stadium that they played in because there was no standard homeaway format that we are so familiar with today instead it was operated as a national tour

the k league in the modern era has its own history but one of the most interesting events was the forced exodus of all three clubs from seoul in 1996 as part of a policy to spread the popularity of football around the country also with an eye on stadium infrastructure for the 2002 world cup two of the clubs didnt move far only just outside the city of seoul each to one of seouls satellite cities yukong elephants only halfleft because the city they moved to didnt have a stadium yet so they continued to play in seoul until a new stadium was built for a number of years the k league was without any seoul representation in 2004 after the need to find someone to fill a great big national football stadium and help pay towards it one of those relocated teams moved back to seoul becoming fc seoul



football pyramid  league format

the current system looks like this


 tier  league  notes 

 1  k league 1 12 teams 1 relegation to k league 2 1 relegation playoff with k league 2
 2  k league 2  10 teams 1 promotion to k league 1 1 promotion playoff with k league 2
 3  national league  8 teams semipro no promotionrelegation
 4  k3 league advanced  12 teams semiproamateur 2 relegations to k3 league basic 1 relegation playoff with k3 league basic 
 5  k3 league basic 11 teams semiproamateur 2 promotions to k3 league advanced 1 promotion playoff with k3 league advanced 
 6 division 5 league 6 regional leagues with 52 teams some relegation to division 6 
 7  division 6 league 26 regional leagues with 174 teams some prorel with divisions 5  7 
 8  division 7 league 160 regional leagues with 960 teams some promotion with division 6 

as you can see the naming is completely screwed up  k3 league occupies tiers 4 and 5 and division 5 is in tier 6 this is probably because the top tier k league only split in two in 2013 with the creation on k league 2 and nobodys been bothered to update their names

the national league sits stubbornly in tier 3 blocking any continuous prorel the powers that be have regularly stated that they want to reform the pyramid to have a continuous route from top to bottom at least to the bottom of k3 league within a few years but for some reason its not happening the winners of the 2006 national league season were offered promotion to the k league but they declined the offer the winners of the 2007 season were also offered promotion but declined again even though they said they would like promotion at the start of the season

one of the more recent additions to the k league bucheon fc 1995 joined from k3 league because they didnt want to pay the higher fees associated with starting out in the national league

outside of this system there is the wk league the womens top tier the wk league has been dominated by incheon red angels no connection to incheon united in recent years theres no womens champions league in asia yet but for a few years in the past the winners of the wk league played the winners of japans nadeshiko league for a little more info on the wk league see this reddit posthttpswwwredditcomrwomenssoccercommentsaqkew5southkoreasroutetotheworldcupthewkleague

also worth a mention is the separate u league for universities and colleges some of the teams from which enter into the korean fa cup the route into a pro team in korea is often direct from high school or university teams something i dont think exists in europe some high school teams are even seen as feeder teams for a particular pro team i wont pretend to understand how the system works but ill leave you with the tidbit that park jisung was first signed to a professional team from a university team almost by accident as the scout had come to see a different player but took home park instead

k league 1

k league 1 consists of 12 teams playing 38 games the format is identical to the scottish premiership  all teams play each other three times and then after the split the top 6 and bottom 6 battle it out among themselves to settle the championship and relegation spots respectively the first tie breaker for teams level on points is goals scored rather than goal difference

the top 3 places offer a chance in the afc champions league the fourth champions league spot going to the winner of the korean fa cup bottom place gets relegated to k league 2 whilst 11th place has a playoff with one of the teams that finished 2nd4th in k league 2

international context

in the current format of the afc champions league the competition is split into a west region think uae saudi arabia qatar iran and an east region the east region is dominated by three nations  korea china and japan australia who decided it wanted to be asian earlier this century has also had a bit of success

this year there will be two debutants from korea  gyeongnam fc and daegu fc its dufficult to predict how well these two will fare but if they can carry some form over to this year they could get out of the group stages at least

determining who has the strongest teams amongst the big three east asian nations is a difficult task and is hugely subjective im almost i say almost because obviously k league is best league of the opinion that theyre as close to equal as makes no difference korea has the most number of titles and the club with the most titles pohang steelers china have the highest coefficient japan has won the past two tournaments

in recent years china and japan have had a number of big star foreigner signings eg paulinho torres which are absent from the k league i believe this is due to japan having cash mainly coming from tv money and china having cash from well being china despite korea lagging financially all three nations have the same limit on foreign players three foreigners plus one from another afc country and so korean teams are still competitive due to the relative strength of their domestic players

while were on the topic of the champions league each of the big three east asian nations get 4 places total  2 or 3 to the group stages and 1 or 2 to the last qualifying playoff round before the group stages this playoff round is massively weighted in the big threes favour as they have to win just one home game when the weather is still genrally freezing cold against a team from a nation with a tropical climate i dont know of a korean club ever losing this playoff match

the afc cup is sometimes said to be the equivalent of uefas europa league but its not really comparable the afc cup is for the weaker asian nations only and korea arent allowed to enter



resources

websites  podcasts

for those of us who are linguistically challenged heres how you can follow k league in english

one of the best websites for news match previews and analysis is k league unitedhttpwwwkleagueunitedcom it covers everything  k league 1  2 fa cup transfer news national team and more it also has a podcast if youre into that sort of thing

a really good resource for uptodate breaking news is an english version of a korean news outlet the sports category of yonhap newshttpsenynacokrsportsindex for example is great although youll be getting other sports news in there such as korean baseball football appears pretty regularly also the team that works on writing the articles dont seem to work weekends

tavern of the taeguk warriorshttpwwwtaegukwarriorscom has a lot of information mainly on the korean national team and tracks the progress of koreans playing in europe but covers the domestic club scene now and then

48 shades of footballhttps48shadesblogcom is a great english language podcast following korean football

the asian gamehttpswwwtheasiangamenet is another great english language podcast that doesnt specifically follow korean football but since they cover asian football theyll sometimes have indepth coverage of the korean clubs competing in the afc champions league as well as the korean national team

for your twitter fix the korea football news korfootballnewshttpstwittercomkorfootballnews and viva la kleague kleagueno1httpstwittercomkleagueno1 twitter feeds are pretty quick with breaking news in english 

there is also the official k league websitehttpwwwkleaguecom which can be viewed in english but i think unless you live in korea its going to be painfully slow to use

then of course theres rkleague with news and discussion and where you can ask questions to the community

highlights  watching live

all highlights from k league 1 matches are uploaded fairly promptly to the spotv youtube channelhttpswwwyoutubecomuserspotv spotv is a korean sports broadcaster they also upload content from the kbo baseball and the v league volleyball so youll have to scroll down until you see something saying k1 it helps if you know how korean letters sound phonetically to understand which teams are playing but you can also see which match a video is from the crests in the thumbnail the commentary will be in korean but each video is really good quality typically about 10 minutes long

if you watch to watch live the good news is that is very easy and basically free i have no idea whether any national broadcasters or streaming services around the world have k league rights but in korea itself essentially every thing is streamed on korean online behemoth navers platform the one caveat is that live streams are region locked so to access them youll need a vpn to get a korean ip address although some other asian countries also seem to have access i wont repeat what others have already written so heres a short guide to getting it workinghttpswwwredditcomrkleaguecomments7a3zpwkleaguetipsfordummies3icantwaittoget which also covers another route via the daum online portal or theres a comment in that thread which covers a more straightforward way by using the naver tv app

 korea can be challenging for nonkorean speakers outside main tourist areas if youre an experienced traveller youll be fine but if youve only been to english speaking countries andor europe you might run into problems nonromanized alphabet  low native english proficiency  limited useful english signage but most people are pretty nice about it and try to accommodate
    rely on writing whenever possible reading comprehension is hitormiss but still usually a better bet than spoken english
 international maps apps are neutered in korea lower resolution map data and no turnbyturn directions tldr domestic protectionism and concerns about north koreans having access to detailed realtime maps i used naver maps but kakao maps is also an option both have rudimentary english options but searching is still challenging without basic korean writing

    kf94 masks are plentiful effective and cheap if youre in need of high quality masks consider stocking up on kf94s because of spring pollution issues koreans has a longstanding market for protective masks designed for extended wear even in the states i prefer sourcing kf94s because theyre more comfortable than domestic n95s and far less prone to counterfeiting than chinese kn95s i came around a 10 pack for 5900 won 50 cents usd a mask at a random cosmetics store and suspect you can find them even cheaper if you went hunting

 areas busy with foreign travelers were light i especially noticed this in myeongdong lots of empty storefronts and crowds were much lighter than last time i was around most of the areas catering more to korean tourists and locals were busy
    some international tourism infrastructures just coming back online when i landed on may29 the supersweet direct nonstop arex train from incheon to seoul station was still offline we had to take a normal commuter train thankfully it was running again when we left on june8 i believe airport limousines are still offline
 sometimes english sites straight up dont work if youve used the keta site you know korean digital design practices are questionable especially when dealing with foreign users in one instance i tried booking jeju plane tickets directly on air busans website but their odd western name input lastnamefirstname apparently breaks their backend i got an error message which literally would not let me past the passenger name input page i ended up buying the same tickets through tripcom a thirdparty aggregator site then ran into the exact same western name error site trying to check in online ended up checking in at the terminal in gimpo
 rely on locals as much as you can for recommendations the best places i found were generally through hotel concierge expat blogs local korean blogs naver etc typical gotos like tripadvisor google maps yelp etc are sparsely populated and not especially useful
    if you see a restaurant line check it out if koreans are willing to queue good chance the payoffs worth it the wife and i randomly walked into a couple restaurant queues and without fail whatever meal we ended up with was worth the wait
 beware spiciness level if youre sensitive korean food isnt indian or thailevel spicy but can get plenty intense if youre not used to it my wife had me test all kimchis and anything with pepper she had to eat a bowl of bibimbaphttpsenwikipediaorgwikibibimbap unseasoned because she couldnt handle the gochujang chili paste
 koreans are extraordinarily good at bread basically all around korea i found different styles of bread that would be among the best ive had in the states or europe oftentimes just in random bakeries that happened to be close to wherever i checked in particular cafe onion in seongsu had a fantastic chestnut breadhttpswww1koreacombbsviewimagephpfnhttp3a2f2fwww1koreacom2fdata2feditor2f17062f67794acd2d1cb3c8d7029a1df1489be914985437579032jpg and london bagel museum had godtier bagels i waited 90 minutes for a takeout bagel order which was somehow worth the wait
 even if you know korean regional accents can be challenging i have an okay grasp of standard gyeonggi korean but i was struggling hard with listening comprehension in jeju and busan id only ever heard those dialects in tv and movies and i was a bit taken aback different accents different cadence different syllable stressing often outright different words or phrasing they could generally understand me since i was speaking standard but i stared blankly at some locals responses"
gyeonggi,going on vacation to the philippines with an unstamped arc but i have the approved extension letter,"hello everyone

basically in 2023 i extended my visa e2 online and i never got around to going to the suwon immigration office to get the dates stamped at the back i am now to be completely honest extremely lazy and i do not want to go as i live in gyeonggido gwangjusi 
and it will most likely take me two hours to get there and i have read online i do not need an appointment i just need to turn up and get a number and wait till i can get stamps but i asked on the foreigner kakao group chat and two people told me they went to seoul immigration office instead

show me a real question is

can i travel to the philippines in the next coming days without my dates stand at the back if i have the approval letter of my extension

my other question is do i have to go to suwon immigration office or can i go to seoul immigration office instead"

2 counterarguments and evidence

you might think that it doesnt matter how many times the date of his ordination changed but the fact that he was ordained at all

but if you think about it for a moment you cant help but wonder how he was able to change his initially stated date of ordination at least 3 times for some reason and even change not only the date but the place of ordination its easy to get the date confused but not the place

q and what did lmh actually do between those revised dates of ordination 1977  1980

x200b

lmh changed the date and place of his ordination by jesus at least 3 times

 the complete commentary on the book of revelation 1986 by lmh states that he was ordained in the spring of 1980

blue box i lmh was ordained by the holy ghost coming in clouds in the spring of 1980 and given a book and a staff httpspreviewredditdtetuyij7r2c1pngwidth761formatpngautowebps3c1715a627e6330bad584aebff0f909164e59629

 

this book printed in the spring of 1980 closest to his ordination is considered the most accurate account of the eventas if recent memory were most accurate

it also states that he was given a book and a staff when he was ordained

shincheonjis former official website and promotional material confirmed that he was ordained in 1980 and wrote the letter

q how could the location and date of ordination have been altered several times it would be understandable if it were changed only once but the fact that it was modified through multiple revisions gradually being pushed back by three years is difficult to believe

but lets assume we comprehend these alterations based on the physical fulfillment being established perspective despite the change in location what was lmh truly engaged in during that period

in the past he used to teach physical fulfillment went to baek manbongs recreation church  the reality of the sardis church in rev 3 but now he teaches it as if he went to baek manbongs construction labor meeting and now he doesnt teach it at all

in the past he used to teach physical fulfillment he went to baek manbongs recreation church  the reality of the sardis church in rev 3 but now he teaches it as if he went to baek manbongs construction labor meeting and now he doesnt teach it at all

 in korean it is written as the word  the word  means a deacon who lives in the church and does construction work lmh lived this life at olive tree church and the tabernacle temple for lack of a better word in english construction labor is used

this is because it makes no sense that lmh who was ordained in 1977 1979 or 1980 could have served baek manbong as lord one of the seven stars who apostatised serving him as lord and believing in a timelimited apocalypse

jecheon cheongpungho lake chungjuho lake is a great travel destination to finish in 2023 and in order to feel cheongpungho lake properly it is recommended to take a cable car of cheongpungho lake 

the cheongpungho lake cable car can enjoy a vast view when it departs from multaeri station and reaches bibongsan station

if you take a cable car you can see sobaeksan mountain and wolaksan mountain in the distance and the stem of the namhangang river which has meandered from oksun bridge feels like an inland sea 
bibongsan station has a deck so it is good to walk leisurely and enjoy cheongpungho lake and the surrounding mountains
 bakery cafes herbal forest roads crescent moon and heart photo zones and moment capsules enrich travel it is also convenient to use wheelchairs or infant cars as it was selected as the 2020 star of korean tourism for its efforts for the underprivileged

the jegisan mountain skywalk which debuted in 2018 is 135m long with a 57m section of tempered glass overlooking the blue sea underfoot

 you have to install it at a height of 20m to show off your presence from a distance and wear additional shoes that prevent floor contamination 

thanks to the transparent floor it is confusing whether this road goes into the sea or up in the sky

 in the middle of the skywalk there is a sign saying that one wish must come true

at the end of the skywalk a work depicting a zen tomb nangja turned into a dragon in admiration of ambassador uisang is right 
if you cross the skywalk and the connected cloud bridge chulung bridge you will see hupo geongjisan lighthouse park representative lighthouses from around the world including hupo lighthouse were manufactured and installed as models and the uljin hupori neolithic museum which exhibits prehistoric life and group burial relics excavated from the top of jejeongsan mountain in 1983 also adds attractions

gyeonggi,another persons government quarantine experience aprilmay 2020,"once leaving quarantine i was planning on making a break down of my government quarantine stay however ukoreaquarantine beat me to it and much more detailed than i would have done my experience has been a little different so i thought i would share anyway i wont go into the airport details much so i recommend checking the original post firsthttpswwwredditcomrkoreacommentsgf2awzmyexperienceenteringkoreaona90daytourist

about me american came to korea on short term b2 90 day travel visa i returned to korea for the topik exam and a few college interviews occurring in the next few months

i never had my passport checked by staff to make sure i wasnt from a banned country prior to boarding to korea but i did have to fill out paper work agreeing to government quarantine once i arrived in korea

like the op said there are lots of lines and so much paperworkhttpsipostimgcc5ypcnbdwscreenshot20200508at52232pmpng this is before even going through the passport check and an app that you need to install i want to reiterate what op said you need the contact of someone in korea i gave them my boyfriends number and they called to make sure it was a working number then hung up because i have my own phone korean number they called me too to make sure it worked they never talked to my boyfriend and havent called since

because i spoke korean and wrote my entry cards in korean i think the worker at the first quarantine counter not the real tsa type workers thought that i lived in korea on a long term visa and didnt bother to ask me any questions i had to tell her that im coming on a short term visa and i need the special lanyardshttpsipostimgccssqt2ngvkakaotalkphoto20200508171837jpg and i should go to government quarantine

heres where it got different for me

once i got my bags and left the customs area and into the main airport arrivals area i filled out another paper and was escorted outside to where buses were waiting here i had my temperature taken again and i received a coronavirus test which consisted of a mouth swab and the nose swab

i was then brought to a bus and waited for another hour and a half everyone on my bus was an american citizen and i could tell the people getting on the bus behind me were chinese citizens we the americans were taken to the police training center in asan  once we arrived they took all of our temperatures again while on the bus and then first escorted off some people who came from higher risk locations in the country then once they were all set the rest of us got off and filled out even more paper work paid our 1200 1400000 and got escorted to our rooms we were given the option to pay using cash debitcredit card american or korean or bank transfer i used my korean debit card since i figured thats easiest for all of us were given a little welcome gift of essentials such as toilet paper towels tooth brush soap drinking water etc

this whole process from landing to arrival in my room took a little over 5 hours

here is what my room looks like videohttpsstreamablecomerymvb from the first night  photoshttpspostimgccgallerytr6tx8g a week later  foodhttpspostimgccgalleryqvbb4wm

i got lucky with a really nice view i can see cars sports areas etc and beautiful mountains unfortunately the people across the hall from me get to stare at another building of quarantined people

there is wifi available but its absolutely garbage and comes and goes ive been depending on my cell phone data

we get meals dropped off outside of our rooms 3 times a day and have to wait for the announcement over the intercom to open our door all announcements are made in korean and english again like the other op said the food is just packaged  style or 711 saladsfruit they sometimes give us snacks with our meals like chocopie crackers chocolate they also come around twice a day 10am and 8pm and check temperatures you have to report your temperature to the app you download in the airport we are given orange hazard waste bags and boxes which we fill tape up and place outside our door to be collected other than grabbing foodputting trash in the hallway you are not allowed to leave under any circumstances you will be deported from the country patients who test positive for corona are not allowed to enter the hallway at all

item delivery is allowed but no food alcohol cigarettes anything like that they do open the packages and inspect them and if your item is not allowed then you will not receive it until you leave

someone who was on the bus from the airport to asan tested positive for the coronavirus so they tested all of us a second time so make sure none of us caught the virus from that individual

we were told that on our last day we can either be 1 picked up at the police training center by car 2 take the bus provided to seoul station or 3 take the bus back to the airport unfortunately i decided to switch things up and spend some time in incheon instead of gyeonggi so i need to go back where i came from

this is obviously written from the perspective of someone who tested negative for covid twice so someone who test positive will obviously have a very different experience

like the og op said there was really no information regarding this before and i was actually a bit stressed before arriving because it was super unknown i hope both of these post can help someone

edit typos

edit 2 im editing this a few days past this post prime but i just want to add while you are in the government facility coronavirus testing is free if you feel unwell please please do the right thing and tell the workers if weeks later you feel sick again please call 1339 korean 1345 english korea has done a wonderful job keeping this under wraps and it only takes one of us to start it again you can read about the current itaewon club issue for an example stay smart and safe "
gyeonggi,bicycling in seoul alternatives to  and their 3speed bikes,"started biking recently since i cant hike anymore knees hurt too much  i joined  and am amazed by their convenience their inventory of so many bikes so many locations in seoul that you can rent from and how cheap they are

however do they only offer 3speed standard bikes  i have gone on 4 bike rides so far  these 3speed bikes are ideal for transportation ie traveling to work or through busy and crowded streets where you may meet pedestrians and other riders  but if you are biking at many parks around the han river or going to satellite cities in gyeonggi through dedicated bike paths they are a little too slow and cannot put on much speed  anyone know alternatives when bicycling for leisure and fitness not necessarily for transportation

gyeonggi,typhoon kanun to travel from okinawa to korean peninsula this means the jamboree at saenangeum is finally kaput lord have mercy,"typhoon kanun has already killed two people in okinawa  and the scout headquarter in geneva is taking no chances  they have agreed with south koreas organizers to abandon the saemangeum site and move to alternatives sites to complete the 2023 jamboree festival  president yoon has been told about some of these contingency plans

well the crux here is that some of the participants have already moved out of saemangeum for reasons unrelated to the coming typhoon  we dont need to rehash the reasons here and there will be a time of reckoning for south koreas organizers who have demonstrated their utter incompetence in running the event

the most likely scenario is that the majority of the jamboree participants will be moved to the capitol region of south korea  that is the seoul metropolitan area which includes incheon and other satellite cities in the province of gyeonggi  weather permitting they will be able to take advantage of the areas abundant natural resources to enjoy their remaining stay

indeed south korean corporations are pitching in and more organizations are expected to mobilize to save this years infamous jamboree  samsung has already deployed their medical staff from its hospitals which are among south koreas big 5 teaching and research hospitals to the jamboree site  the daiso discount store chain is donating cool scarves ie scarves designed to cool body temperature during humid summer months  hd hyeondai already sent 120 volunteers to the site to oversee maintenance of washrooms and other sanitation facilities  samsung had also sent their new hires to saemangeum to be apprenticed there to learn presumably about public relations and crisis management

in other words some south korean corporations have already adopted the saemangeum jamboree fiasco as a textbook case to learn about mismanagement and how to engineer a turnaround  good for them but they are forprofit corporations with bottom lines to worry about not publiclyfunded organizations like the jamboree organizing committee and joellados oversight and marketing arms that ran the event to the ground

ps  even prior to this reorientation of the direction of typhoon kanun the weather forecast was was not insignificant rainfall from late tuesday to thursday august 810  the saemangeum site which currently resembles the mosquitoinfested okefenokee swamp of georgia would have turned into the everglades of florida

gyeonggi,stylevana  corsx oil free moisturizing lotion  real or fake,"just wondering if anyone had success using stylevana for ordering corsx and how legitimate it is am australia based so stylevana was coming up cheaper than iherb which is my usual goto online stories seem to indicate theyre authentic

i ordered 4 of the corsx oil free moisturizing lotion from stylevana the labelling all seems authentic bar as you can see in my comparison photo the back of the empty bottle iherb has a different location to the full bottle stylevana which is gangnam gu the bottom of bottle expiry dates lettering style is slightly different but all in all the printing seems properly done versus fakes which typically have typos and badly done editing 

the only other differences are i have a small 20ml sample bottle also pictured from iherb as my large bottle is finished  and the consistency is more see through watery thinner and the stylevana is more white and creamy in look pictured on my fingers right finger is iherb  left stylevana im not sure if large bottles are different consistencies to small travel bottles but surely not

lastly for anyone whose used it youll know it has a nice sweet scented smell which i presume is the birch sap or another ingredient  either way the scent is a nice aroma and quite distinct particularly when fresh the stylevana one lacks this and almost smells more dark and brooding if that makes sense almost like it doesnt have that pleasant smell but again im not sure if discrepancies in materials or manufacturing means anything so smells wont be identical or are corsx and kbeauty products pretty much very standardised so if the smell isnt there its a dead give away of a fake

reading online iherb is on corsx authorised sellers alongside yesstyle etc for international but not stylevana does this mean much

what should i do worth emailing the company with similar pictures or not much they can do would stylevana care 

if anyone else has used this lotion from stylevana and is pretty clued up on it please letme know your thoughts "
gyeonggi,dog kennelshotels in gyeonggi or seoul,i want to travel abroad for a week and im wondering if there are reputable dog kennels in gyeonggi or seoul my dog is 20kg so i expect there will be an oversize fee or something any large dog owners have good experiences boarding their pet or alternatively any one have good experience with dog sitters
gyeonggi,everyone in korea was required to immediately stop exactly at 7 am for the kyj yhai prayer vowing loyalty to the emperor and at noon for the moment of silence honoring imperial soldiers even cars and trains had to immediately stop in the middle of traffic at the same time for prayers aug 1943,"this is my translation and transcription of three articles from keijo nippo a propaganda newspaper and mouthpiece of the government of japancolonized korea these have never been republished or translated before to the best of my knowledge ever since someone dumped these old newspaper issues onto the internet archive over a year ago i have been slowly translating and posting select articles at various subreddits to share my findings with the wider community

in japancolonized korea everyone was required to perform the daily 7 am and 12 noon prayers which were mandatory in korea but not so in mainland japan there were usually loud sirens marking those two times of the day and you had to immediately stop what you were doing and perform the prayers as the following articles indicate starting on august 12 1943 even if you were driving a car or operating a train you were required to immediately stop in the middle of the road or the tracks at 7 am and 12 noon sharp to perform the prayers

the 7 am kyj yhai ritual httpskowikipediaorgwikieab681ec84b1ec9a94ebb0b0 involved deeply bowing several times in the direction of the imperial palace in tokyo while standing vowing loyalty to the emperor the noon prayer was a moment of silence in honor of the imperial japanese soldiers

enforcement of this rule was performed by the korean federation of national power   which functioned as the one and only political party of korea the patriotic groups jp aikokuhan kr aegukban  which were the local level neighborhood cells of the political party and the police

all vehicles must be stopped for the morning prayer and for the moment of silence at noon effective today

effective today august 12 all vehicles must be stopped for the morning prayer and for the moment of silence at noon at a regular press conference on august 11 governorgeneral koisohttpsenwikipediaorgwikikuniakikoiso said neither cars nor trains are stopping even though they may have heard the sirens at noon and called for the transportation authorities to look into this the governorgenerals words were heard by the gyeonggi provincial police department and he immediately ordered all trains cars rickshaws and other vehicles to always stop for the kyj yhai morning prayer and for the moment of silence at noon just as ordinary pedestrians do and he also instructed all police stations to ensure that drivers and others offer respectful prayers and moments of silence so that his orders would be definitely executed

until now government officials merchants farmers and everyone else whether at home or on foot have always offered prayers and moments of silence once visitors set foot on the korean peninsula they voice their admiration seeing such a beautiful scene of people offering their prayers nevertheless trains cars carts and other vehicles have not stopped but instead have sped along in clouds of dust past people offering their moments of silence this unpleasant phenomenon was also lamented by the collective voices of the korean federation of national power on august 10 the iron rules for life fighting decisive battles was issued by the seoul branch of the korean federation of national power as a set of practical measures for the patriotic groups to follow calling for all vehicles to be stopped to perform the morning prayer and the moment of silence starting today all vehicles must stop immediately for the morning prayer and the moment of silence

it is not too late

dont cause traffic accidents

message from mr isaka chief of the provincial safety division

the chief of the gyeonggi provincial security division mr isaka urged all drivers to be careful when stopping their vehicles for the morning prayer and for the moment of silence at noon

all vehicles should have already stopped to observe the morning prayer and moment of silence by now however it is not too late if we do it thoroughly even today it was unpleasant to see just the cars not stopping while everyone else was stopping for prayers  
  
we will strictly admonish drivers who do not do this in the future cars trains and other vehicles must pay attention to their surroundings when stopping in order to prevent traffic accidents if the vehicles all stop at the same time  
  
for example if five or six cars are traveling in a row when the car in front stops suddenly and the car behind carelessly forgets to stop at the same time there is a possibility of a rearend collision all vehicles should pay attention to these points to avoid traffic accidents

moment of silence in the train

the train conductor will remind you when the train is stopped

from august 12 all trains cars carts and other vehicles are to stop for the kyj yhai morning prayers and at noon for moment of silence just as ordinary pedestrians do and drivers are to offer morning prayers and moments of silence to pray for military victory and for the long life of the imperial japanese military as well as to encourage the spirit of respect for the gods and the ancestors the director of the transportation department mr sakamoto who is in charge of transportation for the one million inhabitants of seoul was asked about what measures he has taken for stopping the trains in seoul

we immediately gathered all the employees together and urged them to thoroughly enforce the stopping of the trains i believe that it is a necessary act for the national people on the home front to stop their cars for the morning prayer and for the moment of silence at noon to offer heartfelt thanksgiving however for various reasons it is impossible for trains to stop exactly on time with the sirens and there is also the fear that a sudden stop could result in a traffic accident therefore when the sirens sound we stop the train as soon as possible and the train conductor informs the passengers that it is time for the morning prayer or the moment of silence this is technically difficult but i believe things will gradually improve through training

 i can speak enough korean to communicate with a realtornavigate rental apps
 i know finding petfriendly rentals in korea is a pain and shell be alone while im at work bringing my cat with me is nonnegotiable i have already begun the vaccinationpaperwork to bring her
 i have friends in korea who are willing to view apartments for me so i am not worried about fake picturesnot seeing the place in person
 my friends can also drop off necessities for me and my cat day 1 of quarantine so this is not a concern either

again my biggest concern is the legal side of everything will landlords even rent to me from abroad without an arc do i wire transfer the deposit and digitally sign a lease and if this is even possible right now because of quarantine thanks everyone in advance "
gyeonggi,a beginners guide to teaching in korea,"so i checked on here and noticed there was no real beginners guide or anything like that there were a few specific faqs but not much to really help someone 

so id like help in order to create a onestop shop for everything involving finding teaching jobs in south korea ive only been here for two years though so id like your help in building one the beginning stuff is just things ive learned myself the rest id like you to help add towards



basic things to know

1 qualified teachers like 9599 of english teaching jobs only enlist native english speakers from the big 7 countries the united states canada the united kingdom ireland south africa australia and new zealand these will be e2 work visa jobs while it is possible to get hired as an english teacher from outside of these countries i have a 20 year old dutch friend and she got hired as a teacher with a different visa than e2 its extremely difficult

2 documents you will need to have all your basic country documents ready in order to teach if youre coming from these countries most of them just require an fbi or country equivalent background check and an apostille stamped fouryear college degree getting these two things will cost about 500600 us and take about three to five weeks time to complete after those two major documents youll also need your passport of course and usually have to pay for your own plane ticket to arrive over here which costs around 1000 on average some schools will reimburse you weeks or months later but they rarely pay out of pocket in advance and 1000 is a lot of money for job seekers

3 research do your research on the school youre going to be working for unfortunately most recruiters hide the school names so you wont know what schools youll be applying to until the interview time but if you do find out the school name go online and look up what former teachers have to say about them also one other thing you wont be able to tell most of the time is what reputation large franchise schools have it can often vary wildly from location to location so there is usually no consistency to the experience of schools only a few mainly poly and chungdahmcdi have wide reputations and similar experiences at every school usually negative ones

4 schools theres three types of schools you can teach at 
a public schools which are almost always in the mornings and have long hours like from 8am to 5 or 6pm these jobs are usually easier and treat their teachers better but have long hours and the same pay as positions with shorter hours 
b afterschool academies or hagwons which usually have afternoon hours and can pay the most however most are franchises and many of them have intense teaching criteria bad management brutal work conditions or all of the above hagwons are the biggest gamble to work with 
c adult teaching centers which there are only a few of ybm spep pagoda and berlitz and universities these are the hardest and rarest places to teach at and usually require a good three years of teaching experience in korea before accepting anyone they dont pay much more if at all and their hours are usually broken down into shifts mornings and afternoons but they are often the least amount of work you have to do in teaching

5 students a kindergarteners which are age 7 and below are the hardest teaching positions for most they are always morning positions usually 8am to 5pm or 9am to 6pm and they usually are the most frequent job postings they mostly only seek to hire women to avoid predators which they assume most will be male and in all honesty are just glorified babysitting positions if youre fine with babysitting do kindergartens b elementary school kids which are between ages 8 and 12 which are fairly normal teaching positions however since theyre still kids much of it will still be babysitting at more prestigious schools like cdi the kids tend to be more wellbehaved and small schools the kids tend to be just as wild as kindergarteners c middle school kids in my experience tend to be the best middleground between wild little kids and bored teenagers middleschoolers are around age 13 to 15 some may be bad but most usually arent many schools have elementary students early in the day and middle schoolers later in the day its nearly impossible to find a position where you just teach middle schoolers d high schoolers tend to be lumped into adults as well so most students over 15 are essentially considered adult students and youll usually only get those at adult learning centers unless you get to teach at an actual high school which are rare as far as job postings go

6 curriculums in my experience theres mainly three types of teaching theyll do at schools based on what kind of schools youll teach a conversational which is mainly just getting students to sound like native english speakers with a secondary goal of getting the student to enjoy their time there these are by far the easiest styles of teaching some hagwons offer these but most are only at adult learning centers so these are among the rarest positions to get in my opinion theyre also the best to teach and have the lowest pressure b general knowledge teaching which is not much different than teaching english in the west textbooks grammar comprehension vocabulary etc most schools have curriculums like these c test prep schools which are often hagwons and these schools just prepare kids for testtaking such as toefl or teofl jr these can be a mixed bag often they are repetitive and youll be doing the same thing over and over however more pressure is put on you for these schools and students getting good scores matter more these can often be the most stressful schools to work at since tests are such a big deal in korea

7 locations the short version is the further away from seoul or busan you are the better chance you have of getting hired into korea a seoul is the hardest and toughest city to get into they mostly only look for attractive early20s white females getting into seoul not being this type of person is near impossible as a first year teacher b theres then the seoul suburbs gyeonggi county which includes uijeongbu guri hanam wirye seocho and seongnam you have a slightly better shot at getting into these cities but being an hour from seoul can still sometimes be a little competitive c busan the san diego of korea and jeju island the hawaii of korea can also sometimes be a little competitive as well nowhere near as hard as seoul though d you have a decent chance in getting hired in some big cities that arent near seoul such as daegu in the center of the country daejeon in the centerwest gwangju in the southwest and even incheon which is directly west of seoul e if you go out into the middle of nowhere your chances of getting hired will be a lot higher it is up to you to decide if you want to live in seoul or busan live an hour from seoul like in seongnam live in another big city thats not seoul like daegu or daejeon or live in the middle of nowhere

8 cities a quick rundown of each major place in south korea seoul is like new york city the place you want to be if you like big city life seoul is really crowded and busy and has over 15 subway lines in it most housing in seoul is tiny and overpriced so it has its negatives to living there gyeonggi county has all the seoul suburbs an hour within the city these are smaller towns right outside the seoul city limits like uijeongbu guri hanam wirye and seongnam many of them still offer some big city amenities like bars shopping centers and restaurants so it wont feel exactly like youre in the middle of nowhere being there many buses or trains can take you to seoul within ease however theyre usually an hour long trip or so busan is the san diego of seoul a big beautiful beach city with pretty people in it its a little pricey to live there like seoul and a bit competitive to get work there jeju island is like koreas hawaii off the southern coast of korea its beautiful but hard to travel outside to the mainland on the weekends so youll often feel like youre stuck there its not for those who want to go to other cities on the weekend with ease incheon is technically its own city but most consider it to unofficially be west seoul its easier to get hired there than seoul itself daegu is a medium city in the middle of the country similar to dallas or houston in the us its said to have the most attractive singles there and the best nightlife outside of seoul daegu is notable for being inside a giant crater basin which means it gets really hot and humid in the summer daejeon is a big city and like the cleveland of korea but its extremely boring has almost nothing going for it for entertainment no lame timeworld doesnt count and feels more like a small town than anywhere else in south korea if you like big city amenities but want peace and quiet daejeon is for you

9 applicants unfortunately race matters south korea openly discriminates most schools will require a photo to go along with your application and despite what anyone tries to say they will hire you or deny you based on looks much of their teachers are based on looks and not actual english skills or experience their ideal teacher is an attractive early 20s blonde white female if you are this mold pretty much anyone will hire you sadly the further you are outside this mold the harder it will be to find a job if youre a white male your chances will be only slightly less if youre nonwhite dark skinned your chances will go down significantly the hardest people to get a job here in korea are darkskinned or black males and nonkorean asians gyopos which are nonnative koreans like a koreanamerican fare a little better but only if they are fluent in korean otherwise they have a hard time getting hired too age also plays a factor as well age 2025 is what they look for the most 2630 is slightly less desirable and over 30 is even less desirable unless you have 5 years of korea teaching experience

10 hiring to get hired you have to be consistent and talk to as many recruiters and schools as you can sending out 50100 emails to get one job isnt exactly uncommon if youre a young white female youll have the easiest time getting hired like youll be hired within two weeks or less if youre emailing recruiters daily the further you are from this demographic add an extra two weeks a white male four weeks of emailing a nonkorean asian six weeks of emailing a black person eight weeks of emailing and so on previous job experience outside of korea doesnt matter much they only care about you either fitting the look of a westerner young white and pretty or having serious teaching experience regardless of looks sadly this is the ugly side to teaching in korea however its not as bad as it seems and not everyone discriminates

11 housing most schools like 90 will offer you free housing there is a housing allowance which is just free rent money these range between 300000 won a month to 700000 with 500000 being average the housing allowance to cover your rent is optional but most teachers take it if you can somehow find your own housing and willing to pay your own rent then that allowance goes back into your pay so youll be getting extra 

12 pay they pay once a month in korea the standard pay rate in korea for a beginning fulltime eight work hours teacher is between 2 million won a month roughly 2000 us and 22 million after a year or two youll usually be worth about 23 or 24 million a month after about three years or so you shouldnt be getting paid less than 25 or 26 million a month unless you like being ripped off pay for experienced teachers 5 years will be somewhere between 27 and 32 million a month including housing allowance most schools will pay by contract salary meaning youll get paid the same no matter what but some schools usually adult teaching centers will pay by the hour with a minimum base pay which is usually 2 million any school offering less than 2 million a won for full time work is ripping you off also know that teaching hours is not the same as work hours teaching hours are how much you teach but you usually have to come in before classes start and stay after classes are done for the day work hours are from when you clock in to when you clock out typically youll come in two hours before the first class and teach six hours for some elementary schools with long hours these can vary

13 contracts contracts can be tricky to figure out there are contract reviews posted on here but the general rule is contracts are supposed to pay you the same amount unless you do overtime or didnt work certain days on time every time and are supposed to help pay for your health insurance and pension its common that certain schools will make you pay them back the airfare they reimbursed you for if you leave before six months pass on the contract schools are supposed to pay you one months worth after you complete one year with them after the three month probation period they are also not allowed to fire you without at least one written warning unless you do something majorillegal and must give you 3060 days notice before letting you go some schools will try to scam you out of money or make you do things that arent listed in the contract so if they try this always refer to the contract also as a good rule of thumb if a school has funky stipulations in it such as you cant work for any competitors within 5 miles for one year after leaving our school then its best not to sign with them contract reviews are good for avoiding getting screwed



job posting resources

 facebook groups are a major resource because they are often direct posts from the schools or head instructors groups such as teaching jobs koreahttpswwwfacebookcomgroupstjinkorea english teaching jobs in koreahttpswwwfacebookcomgroupsenglishteachingjobsinkorea or job listings for english teachers in koreahttpswwwfacebookcomgroups1662820273984514 the downside is theres a few spammers on there as well so avoid the spammers

advice

1 know in advance what kind of school you want to teach at public school hagwon or adult learning centers kindergarteners elementarymiddle schoolers or adults mornings afternoons or floating schedules

2 when reaching out to recruiters tell them all the info theyll want to know what country youre coming from if you have all your documents ready what city you want to teach in what hours youre open to teaching mornings or afternoonsevenings which type of students you want to teach kindy elementarymiddle or adults and so on also be sure to tell them what job postings you like the most and mention those in the email so many firsttimers make the mistake of assuming the recruiter will do 100 of all the work for you make their jobs easier and theyll be more likely to help you

3 getting additional certifications like toefl or any teaching certificates may help you before coming in but arent required for most places you also usually dont need to be an education major or have teaching experience in your home country most schools wont care and if they want anything at all will only want you to have korea teaching experience

4 check the blacklists online for certain schools while everyones experiences are different the two schools i know everyone says are the most brutal and stressful schools to work at are poly and chungdahm cdi poly is supposedly horrendous everywhere while chungdahm which i have worked for in the past isnt a bad school per se but is extremely stressful has you working harder than anywhere else besides poly and also pays you the same as other schools starting at 21 to 23 mil meaning youre working harder but getting paid the same as people working half as much cdi is more diverse with their hiring though although that is probably intentional to get non whitefemales to sign on that other schools might not hire then exploit them so cdi isnt exactly allaround bad like poly is known to be but it is more work and stress for less pay

5 there are dozens of job recruiters out there some of them are big names and post all over the internet some are not in my personal experience i would not recommend these recruiters they are either very discriminatory or a complete waste of time ace recruiting big company park english complete crap prime recruitment korea garbage and whizz crap

6 teaching in korea can be hard for the first six months to 2 years the first two to six months can be really difficult then after that youll get used to things but still not be experienced yet to really have it be easy that takes at least two years or so so if it seems hard at first stick it out and keep your head up for many teachers the first year is just about surviving not quitting and running back home but it gets easier over time




so thats all i have for now anyone willing to suggest more to add i can do so thank you and good luck"

gyeonggi,buyeo former capital of baekje was used by the colonial regime to showcase a korean nation which remained completely faithful to japan and sent its sons to japan for training in the japanese spirit and taught that the 2nd king of silla was the reincarnation of the shinto god susanoo 1943,"this is my translation and transcription of two educational articles from keijo nippo a propaganda newspaper and mouthpiece of the government of japancolonized korea they have never been republished or translated before to the best of my knowledge ever since someone dumped these old newspaper issues in the internet archive in october 2021 i have been slowly translating and posting select articles at various subreddits to share my findings with the wider community

these articles are the first two in a series of three educational articles published by the colonial regime to promote a heavily biased narrative of japanese and korean history from mythological times to the fall of the kingdom of baekje in 660 ad which the regime uses to justify its colonization of korea beginning with a visit to the historical remains of buyeo the former capital of baekje they narrate the long history of intimate cultural economic and military exchanges between ancient japan and baekje and how japanese military forces kept propping up baekje for centuries until they were finally defeated by silla and tang dynasty china in 660 ad then the second article shifts into bizzare speculation about the alleged mythological ties between ancient japan and silla how the second king of silla was allegedly the reincarnation of the shinto god susanoo how the son of susanoo allegedly landed at soshimori in silla and then settled in woongjin and how the greatgreatgrandson of susanoo allegedly used three ropes to drag silla into the realm of izumo actually the more mainstream interpretation of the story is that the three ropes were used to drag shimane prefecture into the realm of izumo in 1944 governorgeneral koiso addressed the entire korean nation alleging that the korean mythological figure dangun was susanoohttpswwwredditcomrkoreacomments11jha67thekoreanpeoplewereallegedlydescendantsof

it goes without saying that you should take the historical narrative in these articles with a skeptical eye however it does provide an important insight into the version of korean history that was imposed on the korean people during the colonial era the third article of the series which i have yet to translate shows how korean school girls were immersed in this historical narrative during their field trip to buyeo

there are many references to both famous and obscure japanese and korean historical places and people so i added plenty of links to wikipedia articles and other resources for further reading i tried to link to english language resources whenever possible but often the only online resources were in japanese or korean so some of the linked resources are only in those two languages

the second article gave a correction to a typographical error in the first article so i made the correction in the transcription and the translation accordingly i also made other minor corrections to typographical errors in the articles where i spotted them especially minor spelling errors in peoples names and numbers

describing the holy land of buyeo part 1

cherry blossoms abound where baekje rose and fell

know yourselves this the historic site of japanesekorean unification

although the gods have not yet quieted down in buyeohttpsenwikivoyageorgwikibuyeo worshipers who come to buyeo these days feel an affinity to this holy place because it is a solemn historic testament to japanesekorean unification from the reign of the 11th emperor suininhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperorsuinin to the reign of the 38th emperor tenjihttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperortenji during a long period of 689 years from 29 bce to 661 ad friendly relations between japan and baekjehttpsenwikipediaorgwikibaekje were consistently maintained without a single day of conflict between the two nations at times the two nations were bound by economic agreements and military alliances they conducted mutual assistance through culture exchanges which brought mutual prosperity to both nations baekje as the younger brother served japan the elder brother and baekje remained completely faithful to japan refusing until the very end of its existence to surrender to tang dynasty china baekje was supported by japanese marine troops and although the famous decisive battle of baekganghttpsenwikipediaorgwikibattleofbaekgang did not end in japans favor baekje refused to surrender to tang dynastyhttpsenwikipediaorgwikitangdynasty china even upon death thus buyeo the site of the baekje royal castle was trampled upon by tang chinese forces and the royal castle and many other buildings were reduced to ashes in the fires of the war

today only the baekje pagodahttpsenwikipediaorgwikifivestoriedstonepagodaofjeongnimsatemplesite standing in the southern suburbs of buyeohttpsenwikivoyageorgwikibuyeo and a monument left by tang chinese general liu renyuanhttpskowikipediaorgwikiec9ca0ec9db8ec9b90eb8bb9eb8298eb9dbc  remain as testament to what happened nearly 1400 years ago the many historical artifacts buried in the ground remind us of the good governance of the baekje kings and remind travelers of a great city that once thrived with a population of 700000 people standing on naghwaam rockhttpsencykoreaaksackrarticlee0011673   where 3000 beautiful women of the royal court threw themselves off the cliff in defense of their purity on the last day of the existence of baekjehttpsenwikipediaorgwikibaekje one can feel a sense of melancholy

there is a story of a fierce battle fought by gyebaekhttpsenwikipediaorgwikigyebaek   a general of baekjehttpsenwikipediaorgwikibaekje who killed his wife and children before deployment to steel himself with a determination to die in battle fought against 30000 tang chinese troops with only 3000 men and died while personally protecting his sovereign this story is quite similar to those told about the generals of iki islandhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiikiisland and tsushimahttpsenwikipediaorgwikitsushimaisland who defended japan during the mongol invasionshttpsenwikipediaorgwikimongolinvasionsofjapan of 1274 and 1281 what is even more impressive are the ruins of the military storehouse the large amount of rice barley and soybeans that emperor tenjihttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperortenji had sent to baekje as aid in the relief efforts were burnt in a tragic military fire and the charred grains are still being gathered today in their original shapes by village children picking wild grass as a reporter as i went to this place gazed at the mountains and stared at the flowing waters of baekmagang riverhttpsenglishvisitkoreaorkrenuatrsien3111jspcid800052   i saw powerful traces of japanesekorean unification which speak of a history that lasted for more than a millenium

during the reign of the 32nd emperor sushunhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperorsushun three japanese maidens went to baekjehttpsenwikipediaorgwikibaekje to study when we see the ruins of goransa templehttpsenglishvisitkoreaorkrenuatrsien3111jspcid264547   where the japanese maidens trained under the buddhist monks of baekje we can also imagine the richness of the exchanges between japan and korea

in 1939 a dedication ceremony was performed for the newly constructed buyeo jingu shrinehttpskowikipediaorgwikiebb680ec97acec8ba0eab681 in which the four deities were used as pillars to deepen the bonds of japanesekorean unification into this place for the first time the 25 million people of the korean peninsula were overjoyed and the musical score of their precious labor was played under the sun in the clouds of the sacred mountain of busohttpsencykoreaaksackrarticlee0024319   construction in the holy city is now underway in chungnam with a total area of 13380000 pyeong 4423 hectares centering on the inner park of 220000 pyeong 73 hectares and the outer park of 80000 pyeong 65 hectares

in place of the baekmagang riverhttpsenglishvisitkoreaorkrenuatrsien3111jspcid800052 which used to be the only trade route in the past four railway lines including the local railway line crisscross the holy city and a new waterworks project has been completed to direct the water from the baekmagang river the remains of a statue of buddha which had forlornly lain underground for more than 1000 years have been excavated by the honoring committee these remains have given new meaning to the restoration project for the old capital and they will be used to ensure the life of the people for tens of thousands of years to come as they exchange smiles with the divine realm of mount busohttpsencykoreaaksackrarticlee0024319   day and night thus the construction of buyeo jingu shrinehttpskowikipediaorgwikiebb680ec97acec8ba0eab681 proceeded revealing the achievements of the more than 1000 years of the joining together of the two peoples

there used to be a stone monument that baekje had erected for the korean people to defend against tang dynasty china to prepare for the invasion of goguryeohttpsenwikipediaorgwikigoguryeo by the manchu peoples and to resist the tyranny of sillahttpsenwikipediaorgwikisilla although that monument has now been reduced to an empty pile of rubble the people who have consistently carried on the legacy of baekje have continued to see japan as their ally and many migrated to japan after the collapse of their nation their descendants who include those of dr wanihttpsenwikipediaorgwikiwanischolar   settled in naniwahttpsenwikipediaorgwikinaniwakyc58d and various other places in japan and mixed with the blood of the 80 million people of the japanese nation living by the ideals of the founding of the japanese nation since the descent of amaterasus grandson niniginomikotohttpsenwikipediaorgwikininiginomikoto from heaven to ashiharanonakatsukunihttpsenwikipediaorgwikiashiharanonakatsukuni tenson krinhttpsenwikipediaorgwikitensonkc58drin and serving the emperor in righteousness who would doubt the fact that among the 80 million people of mainland japan many descendants of the baekje people have been nurtured it may be more beneficial for the 25 million people who were born on the korean peninsula to carefully examine this history of more than 1000 years rather than to call out for the imperial way again and again

even if we explore the historical changes over the past thousand plus years in the two peoples who once crisscrossed the narrow genkai seahttpsjawikipediaorgwikie78e84e7958ce78198 in small boats sending assistance to one another there is no room for revisions in the solemn historical record of the two peoples interactions the conscious union of the two peoples who attacked their enemies together shared each others food and shared their cultures with each other has been further strengthened by the construction of the buyeo jingu shrinehttpskowikipediaorgwikiebb680ec97acec8ba0eab681 the path forward for the korean people to return to the imperial way after a thousand years to come together under the imperial family to share the joy of being under one realm and to stand as leaders of the east asia coprosperity sphere has finally been found here now let us go a little further back in history and look at the history of the exchanges between japan and baekje the main focus of this article will be on the reigns of emperor jinhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperorc58cjin empress saimeihttpsenwikipediaorgwikiempresskc58dgyoku emperor tenjihttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperortenji and empress jinghttpsenwikipediaorgwikiempressjingc5ab who became deities of buyeo jingu shrine we will leave discussions about the relationship between the 16th emperor nintokuhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperornintoku and the 36th emperor ktokuhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperorkc58dtoku for another day

before we go any further we must first confirm the location of the founding of the baekjehttpsenwikipediaorgwikibaekje kingdom although there is general agreement in written records that baekje was founded in the year 18 bce in the reign of the 11th emperor suininhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperorsuinin there are many different theories about where baekje was founded in korean historical records and in the nihon shokihttpsenwikipediaorgwikinihonshoki chronicles of japan which is the original source of japanese history nevertheless it is certain that king onjohttpsenwikipediaorgwikionjoofbaekje   who ruled over the waters of the han river in presentday seoul established his government in gyeonggido and built his residence on namhan mountain   dating back to that time sillahttpsenwikipediaorgwikisilla rose in 57 bce and in 37 bce gogoryeo rose by relying on the forces of china at that time silla was powerful and secretly supported the kumasohttpsenwikipediaorgwikikumaso tribe in japan to oppose the imperial court while at the same time silla allied with goguryeohttpsenwikipediaorgwikigoguryeo to bear down on the newly emerging baekje kingdom to check japans continental political ambitions

in response baekjehttpsenwikipediaorgwikibaekje firmly established ties with japan and strictly defended itself but the power of their two enemies was not to be underestimated in the meantime the mythical yamato takeruhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiyamatotakeru defeated the kumasohttpsenwikipediaorgwikikumaso tribe in kysh at the order of the 12th emperor keikhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperorkeikc58d and when the 14th emperor chaihttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperorchc5abai passed away empress jinghttpsenwikipediaorgwikiempressjingc5ab took his place and led an expedition against sillahttpsenwikipediaorgwikisilla which was just one of many actions that the imperial court undertook to save baekje in the reign of the 21st emperor yryakuhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperoryc5abryaku however the war became more serious as silla and goguryeo once again increased their pressure on baekje and king gaerohttpsenwikipediaorgwikigaeroofbaekje   of baekje was killed in battle the royal court was moved to gongjuhttpsenwikipediaorgwikigongju for safety and the princehttpsenwikipediaorgwikimunjuofbaekje who was studying abroad in japan at the time became king thus the gongju period of baekje history began in the reign of the 28th emperor senkahttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperorsenka king seonghttpsenwikipediaorgwikiseongofbaekje   of baekje moved the capital to buyeohttpsenwikivoyageorgwikibuyeo under the patronage of japan where it remained for six generations until the reign of the 37th empress saimeihttpsenwikipediaorgwikiempresskc58dgyoku for 123 years baekje enjoyed a golden age king uijahttpsenwikipediaorgwikiuijaofbaekje   of baekje served japan well and was ruled righteously

however sillahttpsenwikipediaorgwikisilla and tang dynasty china formed a renewed alliance and threatened baekjehttpsenwikipediaorgwikibaekje again when news of the danger reached the empresshttpsenwikipediaorgwikiempresskc58dgyokus ears she ordered her main headquarters to be moved to asakura palacehttpsjawikipediaorgwikie69c9de58089e6a998e5ba83e5baade5aeae on kysh island to support baekje but she passed away in the year 661 ad at 67 years old written by correspondent mr arai

describing the holy land of buyeo part 2

benevolent deference to the historic dynasties

historic sites showing the support given to baekje by japan

after the death of empress saimei prince nakano e succeeded to the throne and became emperor tenjihttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperortenji emperor tenji also inherited the legacy of his predecessor and sent soldiers to rescue baekjehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiempresskc58dgyoku when he heard that king uijahttpsenwikipediaorgwikiuijaofbaekje   had finally been defeated by tang chinese forces and that the royal castle had been captured he immediately appointed prince pungjanghttpsenwikipediaorgwikibuyeopung   who was studying in japan at the time as the king of baekje emperor tenji also had his loyal retainer gwisil boksinhttpsenwikipediaorgwikigwisilboksin   reassemble a righteous army thus the territory of baekje was once again restored but after two years the dark lord pungjang executed the loyal retainer boksin and the country was once again in disarray creating an opportunity for tang dynasty china to intervene five japanese rescue attempts were unsuccessful and baekje was lost and the rescue forces returned to japan with the exiled baekje political refugees thus ending the long relationship between the japan and baekje later in the year 668 ad during the reign of emperor tenji goguryeohttpsenwikipediaorgwikigoguryeo was also defeated by tang dynasty china and sillahttpsenwikipediaorgwikisilla gained more and more momentum until finally in the year 681 ad during the reign of emperor tenmuhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperortenmu silla possessed most of the korean peninsula

the above is a general description of the relationship between japan and baekjehttpsenwikipediaorgwikibaekje but now i would like to deepen our discussions into the divine period and describe the process leading up to the reign of emperor jinhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperorc58cjin to clarify the proof of japanesekorean unification and to investigate the precious significance of the divine restoration of buyeohttpsenwikivoyageorgwikibuyeo the nihon shokihttpsenwikipediaorgwikinihonshoki tells a myth about susanoonomikotohttpsenwikipediaorgwikisusanoonomikoto the younger brother of amaterasuhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiamaterasu who willed a divine mandate to manage the continent and so he sent his son isotakeruhttpswwwjapanesewikicomshintoisotakeruhtml down to the land of sillahttpsenwikipediaorgwikisilla in soshimori from soshimori isotakeru moved to kumanasuminewoongjinhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiungjin   which is now in gongju cityhttpsenwikipediaorgwikigongju in chungnam province in the chronicles of the founding of izumohttpsenwikipediaorgwikiizumoprovince which is a collection of stories about the izumo dynasty since the reign of kuninushinomikotohttpsenwikipediaorgwikic58ckuninushi it unquestionably says that the izumo dynasty extended its rule stretching from the korean peninsula to the coastal areas of japan

susanoonomikotos greatgreatgrandson omizununokamihttpsjawikipediaorgwikie6b7a4e7be8ee8b186e5a5b4e7a59e desired the land of sillahttpsenwikipediaorgwikisilla and proclaimed i will cast three ropes on the land and pull on them thus it is said that he brought silla into the culture of izumo although it is beyond the scope of this article to go into detail about the myth of the three ropeshttpsjawikipediaorgwikie59bbde5bc95e3818de7a59ee8a9b1 there are numerous theories saying that sillas second king namhae of sillahttpsenwikipediaorgwikinamhaeofsilla    who is mentioned in the records of the three kingdomshttpsenwikipediaorgwikirecordsofthethreekingdoms was the reincarnation of susanoonomikoto the fact that and the peoples of silla and japan have mixed their blood for 2600 years proves the deep connection of the korean peninsula to the imperial nation

therefore when we consider that silla which destroyed baekjehttpsenwikipediaorgwikibaekje also had the blood of japan flowing through their veins and that the fearlessness of the soldiers of silla was a legacy of susanoonomikotohttpsenwikipediaorgwikisusanoonomikotos wisdom then silla cannot be viewed only as a hated enemy

thus the izumo dynasty returned to divine rule and the coastal regions were unified with emperor jimmuhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperorjimmu completing his conquests and establishing his capital in yamatokunihara during the 860 years leading up to the reign of the 14th emperor chaihttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperorchc5abai the legacy of the izumo dynasty in subjugating korean territory was passed down through the generations of the imperial court however when silla once again attempted to invade baekje empress jinghttpsenwikipediaorgwikiempressjingc5ab assembled an army to send into distant korea to rescue baekje in the reign of the fifteenth emperor jinhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperorc58cjin when empress jing was regent dr wanihttpsenwikipediaorgwikiwanischolar   came to japan from baekje in 285 ad and presented japan with the analectshttpsenwikipediaorgwikianalects of confucius and a thousand chinese characters maketsuhttpspolygondrillcomweaverscametojapan  brought her sewing skills to japan takusohttpswwwbuccyakekojikicomarchives1006109241html  came to japan as a blacksmith suzukorihttpswwwbuccyakekojikicomarchives1006109388html  brought the art of sake brewing to japan to serve the whims of emperor jin who praised him with the words the sake brewed by suzukori has made me drunk again the mellowness of this sake makes me drunk

in this way during the reign of emperor jinhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperorc58cjin baekje recovered friendship with japan deepened and cultural exchanges benefited japan to a great extent in response to this japan supported the defense of baekje and the foundation of unity between japan and baekje was completed thus generations of emperors maintained friendly relations with baekje along with the spread of buddhism in order to further solidify the spiritual bond between the two countries many baekje generals received an imperial decree to move to japan and the kings of baekje also sent their sons to japan for training in the japanese spirit

in the 455 years from 200 ad when empress jinghttpsenwikipediaorgwikiempressjingc5ab defeated silla to 655 ad when empress saimeihttpsenwikipediaorgwikiempresskc58dgyoku ascended the throne the asukahttpsenwikipediaorgwikiasukaperiod culture arose in japan and buyeohttpsenwikivoyageorgwikibuyeo the royal city of baekje entered its golden age baekmagang riverhttpsenglishvisitkoreaorkrenuatrsien3111jspcid800052 was busy with trading ships from the two countries and there were mass exchanges of people between the two countries there were growing numbers of koreans who became japanese people as well as growing numbers of japanese people who became longterm residents of baekje

in the midst of such peace silla in cooperation with tang dynasty china vigilantly watched over baekje when goguryeo invaded baekjes frontiers baekje became a tumultuous place with elites already weakened by dreams of academia the two platforms to greet the full moons on the sacred top of mount busohttpsencykoreaaksackrarticlee0024319   are testament to the king of baekje at that time who wept at seeing the shadow of the moon floating down and disappearing as he was accompanied by one hundred beautiful women before the japanese forces arrived to help the weakly equipped baekje troops a combined force of 180000 soldiers from silla and tang dynasty china finally invaded baekje castle and captured king uijahttpsenwikipediaorgwikiuijaofbaekje   at the time 3000 beautiful women of the royal palace including japanese women were too ashamed to fall into the hands of the enemy so they dared to take their own lives by leaping like flower petals from a rocky head overlooking the abyss of baekmagang riverhttpsenglishvisitkoreaorkrenuatrsien3111jspcid800052 this rock later named naghwaam rockhttpsencykoreaaksackrarticlee0011673   fallen flower rock still reminds visitors of the tragedy of the destruction of baekje

the tragic news of baekjes imminent peril also caused a stir among the japanese people and the imperial court empress saimeihttpsenwikipediaorgwikiempresskc58dgyoku had weapons and warships ready at a moments notice and she moved the main headquarters to tsukushihttpsenwikipediaorgwikitsukushiprovince to control the military situation however she passed away at 68 years old in asakura palacehttpsjawikipediaorgwikie69c9de58089e6a998e5ba83e5baade5aeae

emperor tenjihttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperortenji as mentioned in the first part of this article series sent his commander abenohirafuhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiabenohirafu to rescue baekje in a hurry and he also sent prince pungjanghttpsenwikipediaorgwikibuyeopung   to baekje with more than 5000 soldiers with assistance from the younger sister of nokomoshikihttpsjawikipediaorgwikie5a49ae8928be695b7 hearing that gwisil boksinhttpsenwikipediaorgwikigwisilboksin   his loyal retainer in baekje was fighting to recapture the royal castle with his righteous army he gave boksin 100000 arrows 500 kin 300 kg of thread 1000 kin 600 kg of cotton 1000 sheets of cloth 1000 strips of leather and 3000 saka 540000 liters of rice now if you visit the site of the military storehouse at the top of the castle and remove the weeds you will find in the soil a great deal of the original rice and soybeans that were sent here by the emperor which have subsequently been carbonized in their original shapes and have not been damaged by the weather over the past thousand plus years

with the support of the japanese forces the baekje capital was once again restored after driving out the tang chinese general liu renyuanhttpskowikipediaorgwikiec9ca0ec9db8ec9b90eb8bb9eb8298eb9dbc but within two years of the restoration internal chaos broke out in baekje and the foolish dark prince pungjanghttpsenwikipediaorgwikibuyeopung   was once again scorned by the coalition forces of silla and tang dynasty china after he killed many of his distinguished ministers including boksinhttpsenwikipediaorgwikigwisilboksin and the royal castle was again surrounded by the enemy the emperors troops led by abenohirafuhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiabenohirafu with 170 warships and 27000 soldiers led by kamitsukenowakakohttpsjawikipediaorgwikie4b88ae6af9be9878ee7a89ae5ad90 were isolated in the lower reaches of baekmagang riverhttpsenglishvisitkoreaorkrenuatrsien3111jspcid800052 by the superior force of the enemy interceptors although the emperors troops fought well they ran out of arrows so they evacuated the defeated baekje government officials and people and retreated to japan

on september 25th in the 2nd year of the reign of emperor tenjihttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperortenji the 600year history of baekje which had flourished here in buyeohttpsenwikivoyageorgwikibuyeo was reduced to a mere tale of autumn grass along with the passing of the moon on myeongwoldaehttpwwwheritagegokrhericulculselectdetaildoccbacpno2333900070000pageno1120

gyeonggi,my two cents on the  protests thats going on again,"i guess i understand why theyre opting for their methods of protests as if they dont do outrageous protests such as the ones theyve been conducting noone gives two shits about their cause   

even now there are some that say lets just give they what they want and end this without even understanding what they really want  

but    

i really think that what theyre demanding is pretty over the top and unreasonableespecially their main agenda  

their demands are  

budget for deinstitutionalizing patients to be raised from krw 200mn to krw 600bn

disabled persons activity support budget to be raised from krw 17tn to krw 29tn

expand disabled persons activity support service time to 24h

expand special transportation budget for disabled people

supply 100k houses for disabled people

pledge to enhance right for movement in gyeonggido

httpsnewssbscokrnewsendpagedonewsidn1006694010httpsnewssbscokrnewsendpagedonewsidn1006694010

x200b

x200b

in summary theyre demanding that the government pay out money at a trillionkrw level to suit their needs

also in the case for their main reason behind the protests the demand for deinstitutionalization i highly doubt that most disabled people and their families even want that and that they dont represent all disabled people unlike what theyre claiming there are even cases where 2 disabled people were driven to death after  forcibly deinstitutionalized them and cases where  forcefully deinstitutionalized patients locked them up in a villa and embezzelded the support funds which were given out under the patients names

httpwwwwelfareissuecomnewsarticleviewhtmlidxno7802httpwwwwelfareissuecomnewsarticleviewhtmlidxno7802

there are even some suspicions that  is related to organizations that will profit off the deinstitutionalization

x200b

lastly regarding the right for movement in gyeonggido this is more or less a false front theyre pushing to push their true agenda of deinstitutionalization notice how they initially protested for right for movement in seoul but after it was revealed that everything that they demanded was already in place in seoul they just quietly switched their slogan

x200b

when anyone criticizes  people just seem to be like oh you bigot are you against disabled peoples right to travel and villify the person criticizing them however instead of just blindly following the notion of disabled people must be in the right we really need to look at what they truly want and what their agenda is

x200b

i mean ffs these are the very same people who protested for us troops to be withdrawn from korea and protested for the release of lee seokgi an actual enemy of the state that has pledged allegiance with north korea 

x200b

also seeing how the leader of s wife is a high ranking politician in the justice party they may be following agendas and receiving protections from specific political groups

x200b

back when families of disabled peoples families protested  over them blocking disabled people from entering hospitals the families filed a complaint to the human rights commission however the head of the hrc is the wife of the leader of  and the board is filled with people politically and ideologically aligned with  appointed by the previous mayor when a whistleblower revealed the corruption going on within the disabled peoples groups the whistleblower was actually threatened by members of the hrc as well"
gyeonggi,how do northern gangwon province rok tourism demographics wildlife and the economy look like if south korea republic of korea secured the mount geumgang kumgang region,"i would like to know your opinion perspective if rok and un hadnt lost the control of mount geumgang region in the pod point of divergence alternate scenario allied came up with better strategies to withdraw 5070 of us army regiments to mt geumgang region in early december 1950 so the north korea and chinese pva dont fully occupy mt geumgang region by the end of the korean war macarthur resigned on november 15 1949 over faulty intelligence on chinese pva movement and matthew ridgway ordered some us forces to withdraw to mt geumgang region to test the assessment by impeding aggressive chinese pva advance the chinese forces unsuccessfully dislodged the us soldiers and rok soldiers at the northern section of mt geumgang for several weeks after christmas 1950 and by late january 1950 the enemy took control of mt geumgang for several months ultimately allied forces regain mt geumgang region in late spring of 1950 thanks to military technological superiority the chinese pva and north korean forces failed to capture seoul during battle of imjin river its the hotbed critical battle zone for rok to impedeprevent the relentless enemy forces recapturing mt geumgang as a bargaining chip for earlier armistice changdoup lake pyonggang imjin river at north of 38th parallel yeoncheon and kaesong remained under dprk territory after the armistice alternatively zhou enlai and peng duhuai agreed to cease the hotbed battlezone dispute of mt geumgang in late 1952 if preferable to an earlier armistice around february 1953 sygman rhee pleaded with the allied to retake gaeseong but ridgway rejected as un forces do not have sufficient supplies to retake gaeseong with the significant result of battle of mount geumgang the rok held on the coastal town of jangjon changjon

if mt geumgang region remained under rok jurisdiction late dictatorial president park chunghee until 1979 when assassinated by kim jaegyu demonstrated the construction of mt geumgang vibrant resort to attract tens of thousands of gyeonggi and seoul tourists with marvelous skiing and mountain trail possibly seoraksan might not be a popular attraction so i consider geumgang a designated national park of northernmost south korea in 1975 president park presented the grand opening of the national park of mt geumgang despite critical tension between north and south korea near the border of both gangwonkangwon province

present day

today mount geumgang np spent almost tens of millions of us dollars on touristic income like you said getting a cable car improvised the deal on geumgang near the dmz border with mount geumgang under south korean jurisdiction rather than north korean side the souths side ameliorated the road pavement with iron out the surface unfortunately in north korean side pyongyang authority forbidden north korean impoverished tourists from travelling to souths side mount kumgang thats sad news for communist north korea side

nevertheless we could imagine the korean tourists endured the journey to take a mountain trail without military interference these tourists thrilled to reach higher altitude while walking at the trail in early 2010s 201114 gangwon provincial governor implemented the project for resort houses near the river inside mt geumgang"
gyeonggi,worth it to reserve bus tickets in advance for leaving the airport,"hi everyone i will be traveling to korea for the first time in midseptember to visit a friend my friend will not be able to pick me up from the icn airport so i will need to find my way to pyeongtaek on my own i know the route i will need to take starting with the 4100 gyeonggi airport bus from icn

i have been watching the flight number that i will be taking and it is sometimes delayed up to an hour i am wondering if it would be worth it to reserve a bus ticket for a specific time in advance if the buses are usually full and cross my fingers i get there in time or if i should just wait to get a bus ticket when i land so i dont waste my money if i miss it my flight would be scheduled to come in around 430pm

how full are the buses usually do people recommend reserving tickets if anyone has experience with that bus specifically that would be great too thank you"
gyeonggi,nand flash memory market  growth trends covid19 impact and forecasts 2022  2027,"the nand flash memory market was valued at usd 66 52 billion in 2021 and it is expected to reach a value of usd 94 24 billion by 2027 registering a cagr of 5 33 over the forecast period 2022  2027

new york march 18 2022 globe newswire  reportlinkercom announces the release of the report nand flash memory market  growth trends covid19 impact and forecasts 2022  2027  httpswwwreportlinkercomp06246223utmsourcegnw 
the current macro trends of ai and machine learning mobility and connectivity are favorable to the nand markets and is expected to increase its share in the semiconductor market 

key highlights 
with the rise of pcs and smartphones nand flash consumption is dramatically increasing much of which is attributed to the growth of the average capacity in smartphones this is expected to drive the demand for nand flash packaging thus influencing the demand for memory packaging 
according to micron the average smartphone contained 43 gb of nand flash storage and it is expected to grow substantially over the next four years by 2021 the company estimates that the average phone may have 142 gb of nand flash storage with flagship devices having one terabyte of flash storage 
other consumer products such as tablets and cameras along with industrial equipment and sensors automotive systems and medical devices rely upon flash memory which is integrated alongside their processors that stores both data and the code they execute as demand for massive data processing for artificial intelligence and machine learning applications grows the trend for flashbased storage will continue to evolve 
production of chinabased nand flash vendors was not severely affected by the outbreak of novel covid19 this is because the plants are highly automated have relatively low demands for manpower and operators are also stocked up with raw materials before the chinese lunar new year foundry output was delivered to customers in china because semiconductor fabrication plants hold national special licenses these allow them to ship their products throughout domestic china even with cities under quarantine 
the electronics device sector is anticipated to be impacted significantly by the covid19 outbreak as china is one of the major suppliers of raw materials and finished products the industry faced a reduction in production disruption in the supply chain and price fluctuations the sales of prominent electronic companies were affected during the period the travel restriction both of people and product hampered the markets growth in the short run 

key market trends 

smartphone segment is expected to witness significant growth 

flash memory storage has become an essential component in smartphones the nand flash demand has been growing exponentially primarily driven by the growth of the average capacity in smartphones 
nand flash memory in smartphones can significantly enhance the performance of web browsing email loading games and even social network sites such as facebook with the increasing adoption of smartphones companies are adding extra features and applications to differentiate their products from other manufacturers 
for instance manufacturers are integrating features such as gesture control fingerprint scanners and gps into the devices this is boosting the demand for nand flash memory which is used as code storage media for smartphones 
with 5g wireless communication on its way the use of smartphones would increase multifold increasing the need for the latest models to raise the bar continuously for instance according to the ericsson mobility report in the north american region 5g subscriptions are expected to account for 55 of mobile subscriptions by the end of 2024 

asia pacific to hold significant market share 

asia pacific is one of the biggest markets for nand flash memories across the globe the region has a very high demand from almost all the enduser applications primarily led by the demand for smartphones in multiple developing countries in the region such as china india and indonesia 
also there is a high activity from the semiconductor fabrication facilities in countries like china korea and singapore an immense amount of capital is directed into the chinese market by several multinational memory manufacturers especially boosted by the countrys government initiatives such as made in china 2025 the countrys ambitious goal is to reach usd 305 billion in semiconductor output by the year 2030 and meet at least 80 of the domestic demand for semiconductors which is expected to draw more investments into the country over the forecast period 
multiple new companies in china such as yangtze river storage technology fujian jin hua hua li and hefei chang xin memory are expected to invest heavily in the region these companies are also expected to double their equipment investments 
owing to such development in multiple countries various competitors in the region are intensifying their efforts for expansion for instance as of february 2019 sk hynix one of the worlds largest memorychip makers announced that it is planning to invest a huge sum of usd 106 billion primarily to establish four new semiconductor fabrication plants in south korea in april 2021 the company held a completion ceremony for its new fabrication plant m16 at headquarter located in icheon gyeonggido south korea 

competitive landscape 

the nand flash memory market is dominated by major vendors such as intel micron technology samsung electronics sandisk sk hynix and toshiba as the entry barriers in the market are high the entry of new players is difficult the existing vendors in the market are investing heavily in the rd of new and innovative products 

december 2021  sk hynix announced the acquisition of intels nand unit for an investment of usd 9 billion the company aims to focus on completing another integration process by 2025 thus such developments are driving the market 
november 2021  mercury systems inc announced the launch of the nand flash nonvolatile memory device the new device features a plastic ballgrid array bga package to meet nasas eeeinst002 spacegrade application guidelines for ultrahigh density memory storage applications in

gyeonggi,obligatory filler material  just take a hard left at daeseongdong6,"
continuing

after the third pony keg of beer was delivered it was decided that the next few days would be spent in the conference room discussing what we thought was the best way forward

we wanted dryerase boards so we could start taking detailed notes even though i was well ahead of the curve in that regard we instead ended up with some mobile elementaryschool blackboards and a pile of grainy sooty chalk 

leave it to dr cliff to go into a discourse on the genesis of chalk and its economic importance 

bloody carbonate geologists 

bloody white cliffs 

we geologists need to punctuate their conversations with pictures so these would suffice quite well

at 1700 hours the official end to the workday was called wed meet here again tomorrow im not certain by whom but it was readily agreed upon we were more or less on our own until 1000 the next day i needed to spend some time in my room with my notes and update a number of dossiers field notebooks and other items i was using as a running chronicle 

several folks decided to invade one of the hotels restaurants for dinner some wanted to head to the casino a couple wanted to get a massage and others wanted to do what tourists are normally wont to do on the second day of being a foreigner in a foreign land 

i declined invitations to dinner and other activities as i had a long writing session in front of me i wanted to get this all in its proper place while the memories and notes were still fresh 

30 minutes later in my room after a 25minute wait for the elevator im updating dossiers creating several new ones and updating my field notebooks suddenly after an hours work i notice something is amiss 

i dont have a drink or a cigar i said to the four walls this will not do

i was used to happy hour in russia happy hour is slightly different there are no ice cubes or orangepeel twists in the vodka also it lasts all day

i remedy that situation by finding and clipping a nice oily oscuro cigar and digging the bourbon out from under my boxerbriefs in my dresser drawer i heft the bottle and feel that its significantly lighter than when i left it last night i happen to look in the trash can and spy the wrapper for a box of my festively colored sobranie cigarettes i obtained back in dubai 

hmmm i think it would appear that we have some lightfingered cho louies or no louises around here id best guard my supplies a little more securely

i move all my smokeables into one of my now emptied aluminum travel cases they lock with the stoutest of combinations and it will be readily apparent if anyone is fucking with them 

i move some of my best booze into the pretty much worthless inroom safe with a deft application of duct tape i seal the safe it may not be the most secure spot on the planet but if anyone tries anything troublesome theyll leave an immediately recognizable record of what they were up to its just too obvious theyd have to be crazy to go in after anything inside there 

my money keys and passports are in the safe deposit box down in the lobby that the hotel supplies for visiting dignitaries even so they let me keep my shit in one of them anyway 

that handled i spend another hour writing like a madman i suddenly realize im tired of all this and need a diversion as well as some food and of course drink 

30 minutes later im down in the byzantine basement tunnels of the hotel its crowded with hordes of chinse tourists and the casino is ground zero for the incredibly loud chatter 

i look in on the bowling alleys all three of them and theyre full the massage parlor is hopping although i leave my name and they promise they will call over the pa when a suitable masseuse is available evidently i intimidate some of the more demure ones

i wander over to the bar now theres a surprise and see its packed to the rafters as well i decide to wait for a seat to open up on mahogany ridge when theres some gargling over the pa and a pair of chinese nationals leave the bar in great haste 

i grab one of the two newly open seats much to the chagrin of a couple of oriental unidentifiables ou who had their eye on them as well 

sorry mate i said first come first served its the capitalist way 

one of the pair grabs a seat and the other just stands there looking annoyed unspent bullets in my direction forget that ive literally twice their size and could be an aberration as an angry american they just order a couple of drinks and content themselves in giving me dirty looks and probably say nasty things in their own indecipherable language about my national origin and familial heritage 

as if i gave the tiniest of rodental shits 

i fire up a cigar as literally everyone else in the joint was smoking something more or less tobacco however there was a definite barnyard aroma a regular dairy air in the room i think some of what was being smoked there was more bovine or equine in origin than botanical in nature 

with numerous hilarious attempts at korean pointing at a garishly photographed drinks menu i was finally served a cold draft house steam porter and 100 milliliters of probably ersatz russian vodka vintage late last thursday this bartender that could at least form some of the phonemes found in american english a few a definite few

since it all cost the equivalent of us050 i really didnt care 

apparently vodka helps flowers last longer when theyre dying but you can put vodka in anything and itll make it better

being a trained observer i rather enjoy just sitting in any old bar smoking my cigar drinking my yorshch and watching people i try and not be intrusive and i never eavesdrop but i like to try and think of what strange set of circumstances brought us all here together in this place at this time it gives me writing ideas some of which i jot down in a notebook i always carry it also gives me a good shot of nostalgia when i look back at something i wrote some 40 or so years ago 

yeah old habits do die hard 

i take a drag off my cigar and set it in the ashtray in front of me on the bar as i go to correct another egregious misspelling in my notebook i have to immediately proofread what i wrote or id never recall later what the fuck i was trying to convey especially if its in a noisy smoky or murky milieu 

quicker than a bunny fucks unidentifiable oriental 1 uo 1 deftly reaches over snags my cigar and helps himself to a few mouthy puffs 

i look at him the empty ashtray directly in front of me him again and then uo 2 

since i speak no real oriental much less korean language and my mandarin at this point is worse than laughable i just point to the cigar turn out my hands and shrug my shoulders in the international what the actual fuck dude gesture 

he just smiles a gappy toothy and snaggletoothed at that grin at me and makes a point of ensuring that i see him enjoying a few more drags on my own damned cigar 

not able to contain myself any further i venture a what the fuck chuckles thats not your fucking cigar 

like gasoline being tossed on a firering full of embers they both go unconditionally incoherently insane 

yammering chattering jumping up and down and getting right into my face they wanted me to unquestionably understand that my few words of english insulted them far more than their filching of my 20 cigar 

ok im pretty well trained in hapkido an oddly given the present situation hybrid korean martial art im at least 6 or 7 inches taller and who knows how many stonekilospoundssolar masses heavier than these two clowns i could easily go all gojira on their hapless asses and mop significant expanses of the floorboards with them  

instead i look around for the bartender i figured since i was keeping him well supplied with korean won via tips and he spoke some english as well as perhaps whatever the fuck these characters were chattering maybe he could get to the bottom of what was happening 

the bartender walks over and i ask him to ask the two unidentifiable twins why they stole my cigar 

he nods in agreement and goes on in whatever the fuck dialect was being used today by the pair 

they say they wanted it so they took it they ask what are you going to do about it the bartender relates

i deftly reach inside my field vest as everyone concerned ducks and covers

i extract two fresh cigars not a 454 casull magnum 

i give one cigar to the bartender and one to ou2 

with my compliments i pleasantly say 

i was well apprised of the fact that in certain places like this the local authorities often approach foreigners with for the lack of a better term agents provocateur 

like the westboro baptist church they try to get a rise out of you so youll lose your cool and either create a scene or take a poke at the miscreant then they have all the pretext they require to drag you to the local hoosegow shake you down for every penny on your person as well as any phones notebooks wallets passports cigars cigarettes etc 

basically they goad you into a fight then drop the thousandpound shithammer when you retaliate 

its all so parochial so obviously clear as vodka this elementary charade only raised a single eyebrow 

im not going to even raise my voice over a couple of cheap cigars that neither of them noticed i slipped them instead of the premium ones i was smoking 

thus defeated i asked the bartender to ask them if they liked the cigar 

what do you think i asked in cordial english too tightly rolled not caged enough too green

uo 2 slipped and said it smells very good where he realizes hes blown his cover 

yeah i like it too i replied so much so i buy my own what are your badge numbers boys i will be reporting this incident to inspector paeng yeonghwan the head of security for the iupgs conference to which i was invited as special scientific consultant

of course they immediately dummy up and feign illiteracy  

i say loudly and very clearly you bastards arent gonna get away with this i mean what is going on in this country when scumsuckers like you can get away with trying to sandbag a doctor of geological sciences

i ask the bartender to translate but alas it was too late they vamoosed when i turned to talk with the bartender

they left so fast they didnt notice me snapping their pictures with my ancient but trusty nokia 3310 revised edition during our little chat even with a mere 2megapixel picture i have enough to show the north korean leaders of the project to get an identification and make known my displeasure of being treated like some commoner or buffoon

they left both my cigar and the one i gave them the bartender tucked the cigar i gave him into his pocket and stared lustily at the two remaining on the bar 

takeem i said i sure as fuck dont want them just a clean ashtray and a refill if you would be so kind i say as pleasantly as possible considering the situation 

both the unsmoked and my smoldering as well as welltraveled cigar disappear as quickly as minks rut a clean new ashtray double beer and vodka suddenly appear 

no charge dr rock the bartender grins as he shoves my erstwhile highmileage cigar between his teeth 

ok fair enough i say spaseebah and deposit a raft of won on the bar the pile wont be touched until after i leave in a few hours time

stranger in a strange land i muse over a couple of further beers 

the call from the massage parlor never came or it did and i couldnt hear it over the clamor of the casino i went up to the hotels korean restaurant had some salty soup a sad sad salad and some form of funky fish i think for dinner i retired that night in a slightly foul mood  

i called es then the next morning and caught her before she retired with a 14 hour difference between us i was getting up at 0700 and she was getting ready to hit the hay at 2100 

i told her of the events of the day previous and she was glad she wasnt tagging along she would have never accused the korean geologists of being behind the times and would have probably bent the guys nose that swiped my cigar 

 agreed that shed probably be unimpressed with this place i promised her that wed go on a holiday when i returned from all this it would be up to her to find out where and id supply the when when i could

everything else was going along smoothly more or less on the home front and i didnt want to give the local listeningin federales too much to say grace over so we said our parting admirations and rang off 

shower shower sunriser of real vodka and citrus a quick brush and comb and spiff of cargo shorts and new ghastly hawaiian shirt 30 minutes later back down in the restaurant for the inevitable breakfast buffet 

after what some would consider breakfast and others would consider a vague attempt at nourishment we reconvened in the conference room precisely at 1012 

nothing like precision with this group 

we spend the next two days going over in various groups what we think would be required to set forth proper the quest for oil and gas in north korea on track everyone got in on the act and we advocated for that we needed everyones input to make this happen or to even map a way forward to present to country officials those from the west on what was needed and those from the east to tell us what was available and the combined wetware to make what needed to be done happen with what existed 

it took no small amount of doing but we secured a set of maps that covered the entire country we were watched very closely by the shiny suit squad that we did not copy photograph or otherwise take any extraneous information from these sheets of infamy all other maps in the country were intentionally skewed with errors deliberately added in to confuse interlopers spies or other personas non grata 

i made a massive stink and told them that if we didnt receive the unfuckered maps aerial photographs and satellite imagery pronto were packing up and leaving that afternoon 

we dont have time for monks resisting the carnival we didnt come here to try and guess if the maps are correct or if our remedies will actually work on maps that say one thing and reality says something else entirely

they hemmed and hawed but as i made the announcement to all before lunch that if the real maps didnt appear by the time we returned from tiffin were gone

and we take tiffin purty durn early round these parts buckaroo 

no one was surprised as i when we returned and there were folio after folio of governmentuncensored maps photos and imagery for our program i guess they finally reasoned it would be a relatively good idea to begin to take us seriously 

we spent one whole day just going over our field geological apparatus they had a good idea of how to use a directionfinder compass and jacobs staff to measure sections however they were totally flummoxed by our brunton compasses gps systems curiously referred to as position finders notebook mapping applications and electronic data storage and retrieval systems 

gad it was like being back in the 1970s before pcs were a glimmer in ibms corporate orbs 

we spent the next week working to bring our less fortunate colleagues up to well not date but at least up to the brink of the 21st century we explained that plate tectonics continental drift and the precession of the continents was accepted geoscientific principles not some arcane capitalist or socialist plot to undermine the quality of science in the east 

yep it was that mindset we had to first conquer i think weve made great headway in that direction today 

the next chautauqua session had us split up into two separate groups we decided in a fit of cesarean inquiry to divide and conquer there are two distinct milieus which are able to contain economic deposits of hydrocarbons onshore and offshore  

instead of attacking both headon wed focus initially on the offshore domain  once we had a good handle on what was going on under the east korean sea the huangai yellow sea and surreptitiously the south sea wed collaborate our findings and work to tie them in and extend them onshore 

the singular phyongnam basin is the one large depositional sedimentological and structural basin in north korea it is filled by the joeson and pyeongan supergroups of sediments which are cambroordovician and permocarboniferous respectively these are good hunting grounds for oil and gas could be elephanthunting httpsseekingalphacomarticle4298986murphyoilgoeselephanthunting country 

but before we could undertake that we had to get back to basics that is we had to understand and delineate the frame of the korean peninsula in other words we needed to figure out how and when the peninsula came into existence 

south koreas geology is much more complex fortunately than that found in the north there were nasty side comments that were due to the relative development not of the geology but of the geologists who studied each countrys geology 

it was perhaps a mean way of characterizing the situation but unfortunately it was also probably fairly accurate 

the korean peninsula is characterized by huge massifs  which are sections of a  crust that are demarcated by faults or flexures in the movement of the crust a massif tends to retain its internal structure while being displaced as a whole the term also refers to a group of mountains formed by such a structure its basically one huge semiresilient rock 

the basement rocks of the korean peninsula consist of highgrade gneiss and schist paleoproterozoic precambrian massifs which formed in the early stage of earths history these rocks are unconformably overlain by metasedimentary rocks schist quartzite marble calcsilicate and amphibolite of the middle to late proterozoic the korean peninsula is floored by a collation of about five of these huge precambrian massifs that acted like microplates during the aggregation of the peninsula these massifs consist of thick dolostone metavolcanics and schist which were intruded by paleoproterozoic granites 

these paleoproterozoic metasedimentary and granitic rocks underwent repeated intracrustal differentiation followed by the events of cratonization ie regional metamorphism and igneous activity at 1918 ga sediments deposited in the peripheral basins during the mesoproterozoic and neoproterozoic lead to stabilization as the basement of the peninsula

these early depositional basins formed the locus of deposition that continued on from the proterozoic through the phanerozoic there are at least three perhaps four depositional basins in the south which are delimited by structural zones such as the south korean tectonic line sktl a huge zone of continental transform faults and forms the basis of boundary demarcation between the okcheon and taebaeksan basins

the boundary between the seochangri formation of the okcheon basin and the joseon supergroup of the taebaeksan basin in the bonghwajae area is a thrust or reverseslip shear zone this thrust is presumably a relay structure ie a restraining bend between two segments of a continental transform fault the south korean tectonic line or sktl along which the okcheon basin of the south china craton was juxtaposed against the taebaeksan basin of the north china craton during the permiantriassic suturing of the two cratons

in the late proterozoic sedimentation was initiated in basins of the korean peninsula  accompanied by deposition of siliciclastic and volcaniclastic sediments as well as carbonates the massifs were submerged in the early paleozoic during a greenhouse period forming a shallow marine platform and associated environments

the cambrianordovician succession unconformably overlies precambrian granite gneiss it consists of mixed carbonatesiliciclastic rocks of sandstone shale and shallowmarine carbonates sedimentation was initiated in the early cambrian with a global rise in sea level on the stable craton of the sinokorean block

there was a major break in sedimentation during the silurian and devonian periods in the entire platform during the carboniferous to early triassic sedimentation was resumed in coastal plain and swamp environments with progradation of deltas

major tectonic events were initiated in the triassic when the south china block collided with the sinokorean block the eastern part of the sinokorean block rotated clockwise and moved southward relative to the south china block along the sktl

in the middlelate jurassic orthogonal subduction of the paleopacific plate under the asian continent caused compression and thrust deformation a number of piggyback basins formed along the thrust faults in the east of the sktl at the same time the entire peninsula was prevailed by granite batholiths especially along the northeastsouthwesttrending tectonic belt

in the cretaceous period the paleopacific plate subducted northward under the asian continent forming numerous extensional leftlateral strikeslip basins in the southern part of the peninsula and the yellow sea a large backarc basin was initiated in the southeastern part

in the paleogene both the volcanic arc and the backarc basin ceased to develop as volcanic activities shifted eastward accompanied by a rollback of the subduction of the pacific plate in the miocene pullapart rightlateral basins formed in the eastern continental margin

the korea plateau experienced continental rifting accompanied by extensive volcanism during the extensional opening of the southern offshore basin it subsided more than 1000 m below sea level

so as south korea was mix mastered by a halfabillion years worth of structural tectonism which created several depositional basins quite capable of generating and storing economic quantities of oil and gas the scene to the north was much more quiescent 

the north was composed from south to north of the relict imjingang belt which was an old backarc basin between the gyeonggi massif to the south and the nagrim massif to the north it is a paleosubduction zone full of volcanics volcaniclastics and other nonhydrocarbon bearing rocks it was mashed and metamorphosed and basically forms a convenient boundary between the complex geology of the south and the more relaxed geology of the north 

heading north we come across the pyeongnam basin the only north korean basin thus far defined that could contain hydrocarbons further north is the huge nangrim massif its a huge block of igneous and metamorphic rocks that weather very nicely and form some spectacular scenery but from an oil and gas economic outlook are worthless 

offshore north korea there are two possible petroliferous basins the offshore west korea bay basin and east sea basin along with five onshore basins could be offering exploration potential at least ten exploration wells have been drilled in the west sea with some showing good oil shows along with the identification of a number of potential reservoirs

the west sea potentially has oil and has reportedly flowed oil at reasonable rates from at least two exploration wells when they were drilled and tested in the 1980s  meanwhile the east sea has seen russian exploration efforts previously including the drilling of two wells both of which reportedly encountered encouraging shows of oil and gas

onshore there has been little exploration to date apart from efforts by the korean oil exploration corporation and also recently by mongolias hboil jsc hbo among five main onshore sedimentary subbasins the largest is south of the capital while unconfirmed reports point to a 1trillioncubicfoot tcf discovery in 2002 

historically dprk was thought to consist of five underexplored geological basins the 

	pyongyang

	zaeryong

	anjuonchon
	
	giljumyongchon and
	
	sinuiju basins
	
these basins are all located more or less along the coast rather than inland this also points to a certain degree of geological aptitude as its much easier to explore along the more populated coast than it is to venture inland there may be more hiding in the interior of the country its just that no ones looked as of yet thats difficult exploring along the coast is much easier 

with 3 basins supposedly proven to have working petroleum systems 22 wells have been drilled and the majority are said to have encountered hydrocarbons with some wells testing production at 75 barrels of oil per day of light sweet crude oil this has yet to be documented or confirmed by the korea oil exploration corp koec north koreas staterun oil company

yeah our work was definitely cut out for us 

it was decided that a series of excursions offshore in one of the few remaining seaworthy which was a real judgment call koec seismic boats would be appropriate the one we received use of was an old decommissioned chamsuriclass patrol boat one chamsuri215215 pkmr215 in particular 

it had been basically stripped to the gunwales and completely retrofitted as a seismic acquisition and recording vessel it had been renamed      or  glory of democratic peoples republic of korea science

in reality it was an aging rustbucket piece of shit that might have possibly seen better days but wasnt letting on all the military nonsense except the powder magazine had been removed and a new superstructure consisting of slapdash hunks of poorlywelded lowcarbon coldrolled steel were erected to form a pilothouse in the area where the bridge once existed they also built extra haphazardly a shooters room galley cold and wet storage areas recording room and storage of tapes and the extra bits and pieces needed for a nonetooextended stay on the sea it was being charitable almost utilitarian 

they could not make their own water so trip times were limited to about three days in length besides they didnt really have a hot galley so it was cold canned chinese chow for the next 72 hours they had a couple of fairly sturdy yardarms with heavy winches to handle the towed seismic arrays of geophones which were of ancient heritage and showed it these were probably appropriated back in the 80s or perhaps earlier when they first thought about opening their waters for seismic exploration 

they borrowed most of the sensing and recording equipment back then from oilfield service companies and simply forgot to return it once finished since they burned that bridge so glowingly they couldnt get parts nor service when things failed being delicate seismic sensing and recording equipment fail they did 

so we had to use what was leftover or what dprk industries could cobble together or what could be salvaged from saltwater drenched recording equipment that hadnt been too heavily cared for over the span of the last 50 years 

we werent terribly optimistic 

so we load the good ship rorrypop as viv christened the thing and head out to the wilds of the yellow sea it was an abbreviated foreign crew as there was really nothing other than upchuck and curse me soundly for insisting the nongeophysical scientists came along 

aboard were the two geophysicists naturally volna and activ i was there stickhandling the logistics and hoping to help out with the geophysical signal source explosives 

morse and cliff the two other geologists accompanied us on the trip and dax decided to go with me as he figured id have access to the best booze no matter where we went 

the remainder of the team the geochemists erlan and ivan the geomechanic iskren the pt joon and the two res viv and grako remained behind onshore at the hotel they set forth cataloging what data was available from what sources its vintage veracity and usefulness 

augean tasks both not as fecaliferous as hercules jobs but still they held their own rations of shit for each subteam 

heading seaward the yellow sea extends by about 960 km 600 mi from north to south and about 700 km 430 mi from east to west it has an area of approximately 380000 km2 150000 mi2 and a volume of about 17000 km3 4100 mi34 its depth is only 44 m 144 ft on average with a maximum of 152 m 499 ft the sea is a flooded section of the continental shelf that formed during the late pleistocene some 10000 years ago as sea levels rose 120 m 390 ft to their current levels the depth gradually increases from north to south the sea bottom and shores are dominated by sand and silt brought by the rivers through the bohai sea and the yalu river these deposits together with sand storms are responsible for the yellowish color of the water referenced in the seas name

being shallow the yellow sea is more perturbed by the frequent seasonal storms of the region the area has cold dry winters with strong northerly monsoons blowing from late november to april i was told that the summers are wet and warm with frequent typhoons between june and october but now all we had to contend with were swelling seas spraying saltwater waggling waves and a shivering shimmying ship 

all the navigation communications and other shiply duties were being handled by both members of the dprk coast guard auxiliary mostly older guys who were of great and high humorous jest and an actual pleasure to be around they were like their scientific cadre on this cruise basically a political give a shit attitude and a desire to get the job done smoke the americans cigars and drink as much as we could get away with 

the scientific portion of the cruise was being undertaken by students of the various universities and members of the north korean national oil company the demeanors of these characters ranged from extremely earnest and stringently north korean politically correct in the students and academicians to a more relaxed yeah lets just get the fucking job done so we can have a lot of drinks sort of view of the older members of the dprk scientific team 

it was a fun admixture of cultures ages professions and behaviors 

oh forgive me for forgetting to mention our guides or handlers they were also chosen nay ordered to come along landlubbers all they were less than thrilled with the assignment and inevitable seasickness which seemed endemic to those of oriental extraction on the cruise however our guides did enjoy drinking as we learned that alcohol is a central part of korean culture and they encouraged us to socialize with them when the time was appropriate 

or not appropriate as i was being denounced by one of the geophysical students after only a few hours into our very first day hell we werent even in the yellow sea proper we started here at pyongyang down the taedong river over the giva dam through pushover across shmoeland to the stronghold of shmoe into the very belly of the frothing yellow sea

most everyone other than the foreign elements on board were either making the trip in the bowels of the ship nursing and cursing seasickness or by rail doing exactly the same thing 

chum it over the side ya blinkered mucker i admonished one bottlegreenish national this aint the captains mess chuckles you have to clean up your own spew

i was reveling in getting back out on the water and regaining my sea legs i never get seasick 

never

ever 

be it a seismic vessel in the heaving arctic ocean a pirogue in the swamps of louisiana my cousins fishin johnboat back in northern baja canada a us nuclear submarine under the permanent pack ice of the north pole or vlcc in the straits of somaliland i just dont get seasick

airsick nah carsick nope ready to puke in a hind20 over the caspian sea during a strong local thunderstorm close but no cigar 

so im doing a titanic scene recreation up in the very bow of the craft standing in stark defiance of the gusting winds and blowing salt spray smoking a huge cigar and totting out of one of my emergency flasks while trying to hang on to my stetson i am also endeavoring to remain upright field vest and really really ghastly hawaiian shirt billowing in the breeze 

im not certain if it was the cigar smoke the windwhipped beard and hair the give a fuck attitude or the flapping of the hawaiian shirt to which the little local geophysicist objected but he was pissed olivegreen with seasickness rubberkneed but still standing a good socialdistance away reading me the riot act in highpitched korean  

as i usually do in such delicate situations i just smile and wave show them im mostly harmless and they either cool down or get pissed off even more and stomp off in disgust 

either one was a winning situation for me in my book 

so i return to doing my ships figurehead imitation and revel in the wind spray and feeling of really being booming sure some might complain of the cold but not me the sting of the saltspray or the windburn but i eschew what most people enjoy as normal weather i live for pushing the boundaries i love rough weather and situations that thrust the edge of the envelope further past normalcy 

besides we were still in sight of land hell if everything went south at this very minute one could practically walk back to shore i can hardly wai"
gyeonggi,small community of 100 russian tatars in seoul featured in 19421944 propaganda articles a young 19yearold tatar girl is praised for filling out immigration forms for her neighbors a tatar woman is commended for scolding her friends with red fingernails for wearing britishamerican cosmetics,"this is my translation and transcription of four news articles from keijo nippo a propaganda newspaper and mouthpiece of the government of japancolonized korea these have never been republished or translated before to the best of my knowledge

the following articles spanning the period from 1942 to 1944 are about a very tiny 100 member russian tatar community which existed in seoul during world war ii the russian tatars were refugees from the russian revolution who fled persecution in russia many of the russian tatar refugees who arrived in imperial japan settled in mainland japan most notably in kobe where the first mosque in japan was built in 1935 kobe masjidhttpsenwikipediaorgwikikobemosque but a few also settled in places like japancolonized manchuria and korea the community in seoul apparently engaged in trading mostly in clothing and miscellaneous goods in the honmachi area which is now the area just south of myeongdong cathedral in 1943 about a block away from presentday seoul city hall on mugyoro they built their own elementary school called the nugman academy where their children could learn the tatar language and culture including islamic doctrine 

imperial japan had a very complicated policy towards muslims as shown in this excellent academic articlehttpswwwcambridgeorgcorejournalsjournalofglobalhistoryarticlemanagingmuslimsimperialjapanislamicpolicyandaxisconnectionsduringthesecondworldwar33287b638f0b1e22aa46b26c5ab1fa31 but to ordinary koreans who knew nothing about this it must have seemed very unfair that this small community was given special privileges not given to the koreans who made up 97 of the population of korea but were largely not allowed to teach their children korean language and culture in schools by the 19421944 period

sorry if i have butchered some of the transcriptions of the russian tatar names since japanese kana transcriptions of foreign names confuse l and r b and v s and sh etc to those readers who are more familiar with russian tatar names please let me know if you can suggest any corrections

martiya the 19yearold tatar girl who helped fill out immigration forms for her neighbors belonged to a local cell of the korean federation of national power   the single ruling party of japancolonized korea the local neighborhood cells were known as  aikokuhan or aegukban which roughly translates to patriotic organization members of the cells would report each other for infractions perhaps for breaking rules like speaking korean in public they would organize patriotic activities like defacing effigies of roosevelt and churchill and also distribute food rations and other assistance similar local cell organizations still exist in countries like cuba and north korea

the central cultural association of the turkic tatar nation in seoul whose members number more than one hundred and are definitely ethnic asians despite differences in appearances are united in their gratitude for living in japan during the greater east asia war the temporary travel control regulations for foreigners came into effect on december 10 of last year and all foreigners residing in seoul were required to submit a notification form in the new format all at once more than one hundred tatar city residents prepared to complete the form but filling out a twopage application form for each person proved to be a difficult task for those who were not literate in japanese

the one who took on the task of filling out the forms on behalf of the tatar residents was martiya 19 the second daughter of mr waliullah ibrahim of the noor trading company at 20 honmachi 3chme seoul knowing the confusion of her compatriots she said please let me do it it is the greatest joy to be allowed to live in victorious japan as a member of the asian race and it is my duty to protect the homefront as one of the imperial people every night she would diligently write on behalf of her compatriots and she has completed nearly three hundred pages of forms without delay

as a member of local patriotic organization living the neighborhood cell spirit martiyas actions were highly praised by mr shimada chief of foreign affairs at the honmachi police station who accepted the documents on february 27th he recounted the following about martiyas actions

martiya is the second daughter of mr waliullah ibrahim the vice president of the tatar cultural association she is a warm and kind girl who graduated from naniwa high school in fengtian presentday shenyang she alone worked at home taking care of the paperwork of more than a hundred people from the same ethnic group as their representative when the regulations came into effect and foreigners had to file notifications her recognition of the current situation and her initiative in cooperating with the authorities is admirable photo martiya the subject of this beautiful story

gyeonggi, featured hagwon spep speaking proficiency enhancement program ,"this one has taken a while to compile because other users dont answer their dms very quickly and one guy answered some questions then deleted his account but this gordian knot is finally untangling

so what ive come to discover is that although chungdahm is a far bigger company has had more disaffected former employees for much longer however the intensity of the suffering from spep is far greater the anger and frustration leaps off the screen duration vs intensity

here is what users have told me and what ive been able to search and figure out

1 spep was formerly named the princeton review but there may have been a dispute with another company about naming rights probably this onehttpswwwprincetonreviewcom and changed it to spep
2 it is an exclusive independent english trainingtesting company for hyundaikia employees both owners are bosom buddies

 here is what spep proper does

division 1 teachers are hired to go around seoul and teach business clients

sometimes the clients come to our classrooms if they are lower level  employees sometimes it can be a group other times it is oneonone  
  
if the clients are more higher ranking like executives you gotta go to them the executives have secretaries who communicate with spep personnel the spep personnel then contact you to tell you they have to cancel after awhile the secretarys just start contacting you directly  through kakao talk or email because that makes sense spep doesnt like that because they want to be in control of all communication the policy is supposed to be if the client cancels on the same day then they lose that time but it does not always happen that way and the company pressures you to make up the time regardless of when the client cancels regardless you spend tons of time communicating and trying to reschedule because you might have like 20 executives in one week its insane and i didnt get any secretary or someone to handle my crazy schedule which started at 7 am and ended at 9 pm  
  
reddithttpswwwredditcomrhagwonblacklistkoreacommentsg1p520koreaspeponestopprep  spepthe princeton reviewin times in aug 13 2020  
  
for starters the head office is in seoul but you wont be working there they will let you believe that you will be working in seoul but instead they want you to bounce around between locations that are far apart so you spend your whole day in a car but of course you dont get paid

in short there is commute time that is not compensated and clients cancel too often then demand makeup classes that clog up schedules i can imagine wasting time going to an office then having to turn around and go to the next client only to have to waste another hour at a different time on a different day coming back to reteach the same client so lets say 7 clients a week cancel and reschedule thats not only 1 hour of lost classroom time but also the commute you cant go home you have to wait out that time somewhere its a lost block between clients then have to commute again and teach another 1 hour how much time is lost and wasted with 7 clients that do this there is inevitable pay disputes and because of the volume of clients cancelling the entire week is either classes or makeup classes as it is in college and what i told my private 11 students you pay for the semester but if you miss class im keeping your money if i miss class we have a make up date the threat of losing money keeps them honest do sick injured drunk lazy college students get make up classes certainly not korean adults are notorious for cancelling and not caring about who is putout by it and management is godawfully terrible at schedules its best not to involve them at all to save your sanity no wonder spep staff was bypassed as an additional 3rd party confuses the situation even worse

division 2 teachers go outside of seoul to teach hyundaikia employees at their various assembly plants

there are factories and subsidiaries outside of seoul spep trains the staff and has meetings in seoul it is kind of expected that youll live in seoul then theyll bus you to these remote locations super early in  the morning they will not compensate you for this time on the bus this all comes as a shock after you already started the job or at least thats how it was one day you think youre gonna be teaching  professionals in seoul then the next day youre told youre gonna have 4 hours of bus rides everyday all over to different factories all of  which is unpaid thats the insanity sometimes clients will cancel at  the last minute youll get paid for that but the client will still  find a way to message you and pressure you to make up the class somehow  youll never have any personal life cause youre up at 5 am and home at 10 pm  
  
i never had to do this commute but from what i understand you dont get paid for the commute on the bus if the client cancels you get paid but there will be many a time when the client will want the class  to be made up so the next time youre out at that factory theyll try to get you to make up that class youll only get paid for one class though would have to verify with the teachers who had to this ridiculous commute  
  
reddithttpswwwredditcomrteachinginkoreacommentshb8wm8anyonehasexperiencewspepparttimeposition anyone has experience w spep part time position  
  
this applicant gets the royal jerkaround treatment asking for transportation compensation look how ridiculous and cagey they get  
  
so i repeated myself to spep and they said they will pay me the transportation fee on the top of the basic payment i again inquired how much is the transportation fee  
  
spep  we pay based on the distance and its not fixed fee besides the teacher in city a is not getting paid with the transportation fee  
  
me okcan you at least give me a range or your rule on calculating the transportation fee  
  
spep sorry we cant because we havent fixed you to teach in city a

ok then assume i accept the job in city a you base it on the distance then whats the fee i dont need to accept the job be assigned to city a in order to throw out a number right now dumb

distance calculator says from spep hq to hwasung plant is 2hr 57 minutes uh 1way so the story checks out so far what is round trip in bad traffic every day this must be done why not just live in the area instead of commuting looks like another pay dispute waiting to happen who would want to spend 6 hours of unpaid time per day it should at least be 12 pay

from tokyo jonshttpsblacklisttokyojoncom  
  
they will provide transportation to and from by car that can be 12 hours going and 23 hours returning due to rush hour traffic you spend roughly 3 hours a day in a car  
  
they will schedule 30 minute classes for you with no break your classes will be 11001200 and then 1200100 etc for many hours  
  
since the cafeteria lunch at the plant is free spep will stupidly schedule classes during this time so that you miss out on a free hot lunch then you can eat what you bring with you and perhaps find a microwave somewhere if you need it  
  
from reddithttpswwwredditcomrteachinginkoreacommentsdbx7msspepspeakingproficiencyenhancementprogram user comment hwaseong dangjin and cheonan in gyeonggido  
  
outside of this i spent 810 hours a day oncampus completely alone i had to be driven the hour each way to teaching for security reasons and was not allowed to leave campus during this time i was paid for teaching hours only meaning there would be days where i taught 5 classes in an 8hour window and had 55 hours of downtime with no electronics nowhere to go and no food the cafeteria on campus was only open for an hour each day but i was forced to teach during its open hours every day because some students preferred to use their lunch time for english classes this meant that i would sometimes go 10 hours a day without food because i had access to nothing but a single small convenience store that often closed throughout the day only when i threatened legal action against this did they finally allow me lunches again but it was the first of many legal threats id have to make to get fair treatment  
  
eslwatchhttpseslwatchinfoenreviewsschoolreviewsasianschoolreviews709koreasouthinasiaschool21207onestopprepspepprivateschoolsouthkoreahtml confirms the lunch situation  
  
spep will have a 2 hour gap before or after lunch at times but then schedule classes during the lunch hour from 1200100 the cafeteria services thousands of employees its free and hot spep will deny you that perk by having classes during that time then have a very needless time gap before or after many students come late to class or skip it because they didnt want to miss their lunch by having english classes which is exactly what the teachers want so the teacher waits skips lunch then students never arrive spep is always informed that this is unethical and to switch classes to the open blocks not lunch time as even the students dont desire it they refuse

httpspreviewredditm4hieyo1h7z81jpgwidth446formatpjpgautowebps43467088f11767a3c997881cb0a1ea5e9da3fd57

ok this is ridiculous on most internet maps i cant even get seoul and cheonan in the same screenshot without pulling back so far as to not lose the site names of the other locations mentioned cheonan is even farther than hwaseong it begs the question why were classes scheduled during the only time the plant cafeteria was open and why did it take a threat of legal action to correct the error it seems pretty reasonable and written in the labor laws to provide a 1 hour lunch and when better to do so than during lunch time so people can eat am i missing something here is this not intuitive or something

some of these stories are so weird make no sense seem so bizarrely illegal and immoral you wonder if exemployees are exaggerating its one thing to be moneygrubbers but clearly another level of terrible behavior that causes others to plainly suffer and then do nothing about it unless someone threatens legal action wow giant     here are some more examples

read this one this fellow who was supposed to be recovering from jetlag was thrown into training and when he was too exhausted to continue they burst into his room harassed then fired him that left him stuck with roundtrip airfare and a whole lot of inconvenience for what what gain is there to not let someone catch up on sleep instead of making both parties start all over again it makes no logical sense not even in a fit of anger should this have happened upper management is ok with this outcome after all that effort not one person tries to fix or reverse this throw another human being in the trash can after merely a few days sounds like they did the exact same thing 3 years earlier from toyko jons 2014 post hat tip to deleted account user

extremely long hours they make people move out of their rooms then move back in why the standard office politics petty gossiping unnecessary work and you have to live there on campus with coworkers and students terrible

reddithttpswwwredditcomrhagwonblacklistkoreacommentsg1p520koreaspeponestopprep spep wed nov 24 2021 be wary of spep

i lost a family member in the spring and i was not able to go back in time to see my family member before passing or even the funeral another teacher was given a full month to go home for his family member with just minimal ailments so there was inequality in regards to  compassionate sympathy to teachers even on the day of my  family members death i was still supposed to teach classes

 summary

firing within a few days long commutes without pay no scheduled lunches long back to back classes constant schedule changes with no guts to tell clients you skip class we keep your cash being jerked around while living on campuswhich is a big nono never live where you work work the same day a family member is being buried the complaints are consistent so im very likely to believe what people have to say about it it sounds like a company run by spoiled rotten children not professionals

 in reddit dev blog 1 we will look at the arms and armors of the korean peninsula that have been recreated in the mod

in this dev blog will focus on exploring how these items were used during the times through examining historical text like a museum if you will

 before you read you please note

the names in this dev blog are structured as last name first name in accordance to the traditional korean method

when new korean terms are introduced every beginning of a syllable is capitalized this is repeated once or twice then the normal english grammar scheme is adhered

the romanization of korean did not follow the academic method but tried to make the sounds as close as possible

the measurements of length may be inaccurate as units have constantly changed through time

lets get started

cholipgrass hat

cholip indicates a gat made of yellowish bamboo strips for men that have done their comingofage ceremony usually around the age of 20

in the initial records of the chosun dynasty records show the king gifting the cholip to use outside the palace and is stated on the daejunencyclopedia of laws on ruling that the aristocracy should use 50 bamboo strips and the lower classes should use 30 bamboo strips this slowly morphed to what men would wear after coming of age but before they were allowed to wear huklip leading to the formation of terms such as cholipdongyicholipboy to indicate men in this transitional period

after the popularization of the huklip cholip became established as headwear of the merchant class along with the parangi royal musicians horse guards and singers wore cholip during banquets and local aristocrats would wear cholip in their everyday dressing attached with a decoration

cholip is similar to parangi but is more advanced in material and variation and can be seen as a link between parangi and huklip the top part is cylindrical that narrows towards the top and the brim is circular the roof of the hat is flat

the flat roof is akin to the huklip but the huklip sports a downward pointing brim while the cholip shows an upwards pointing one differentiating the 2 forms of hats

cholip was known to be produced in ganghwa island gyodong and according to donggukyeojisunglamgeography of the eastern nation is also produced in daegu gyungsan and yungchun

satgat

a satgat indicates a head covering in the form of an umbrella made of interwoven reeds or bamboo strips

it is used to protect from the sun or rain in chinese it is written as nolyipreed hat or nonglyipfarming hat woolyiprain hat and yalyipwilderness hat depending on the material it is subdivided as nulsatgat made of cattails and daesatgat made of bamboo strips and saedaesatgat made of thinner bamboo strips

nulsatgats were used in the gyeonggi province and hwanghae province as head coverings for aristocrats and women and daesatgats were used by male monks and saedaesatgats by female monks

the form of the satgat is rather significantly primitive considering there is no separation between the top and the brim its form falls under the primitive square hat form 

the satgat has been used in fully utilitarian ways since its initial development separating it from other types of headwear that were often used to signify social standing

banglyip

a banglyip indicates an outdoors hat with a cone shaped center and petal like decorations on the 4 corners of the hat

the banglip is a form of satgat with thin strips of bamboo on the outer layer and wanggola form of reed found in east asia cyperus exaltatus on the inside with four petal decorations on the brim producing a more elaborate form of headcovering for protective purpose than the common satgat

the banglip is also called the gulgat or the banggat and a banglyip form gat incidates both banggat and satgat here the banggat is subdivised into hukjukbanglyipblack bamboo banglyip and baeksaekbanglyipwhite colored banglyip by color

the use of the banglyip depended on the period and during the silla and baekje period the people would use it commonly in everyday life leading some to call the banglyip the najae lyiplast syllables form silla and baekje are used

regulations on public clothing seen in the book goryeasahistory of goryeo states that on 1362 king gongmin year 11 ranks above and including daeun and banju to wear hukchobanglyipdark banglyip on 1375 king wu year 0 the subordinate staff of each district were instructed to wear white banglips and ranks were differentiated between white and black with some records showing a difference in material

the use of the banlip changes during the chosun dynasty according to the chosunwangjosikokthe annals of the joseon dynasty 1416 year 16 of taejong ajunslow ranking government workers of the central and provincial districts were instructed to wear banlips dyed with black ink

however records on 1425 year 7 of saejong writes that ajuns of gilju gyungsung gyungwon and gapsan wore pyunglyiplevel or flat hats and ajuns of bukchung and danchun wore banglyip indicating depending on the location same ranks utilized different types of headwear

1444 year 26 of saejong shows that the dojuljaesa district minister of the northern border returned wearing a banglip after being removed from his position indicating that the banglip likely would have been used for hyanglilocal lower governmental positions or people who have left their position later in 1472 year 3 of sungjong during yaejothink tank on traditions it was suggested that the common clothing of pyungan district local governmental workers were to wear hukjukbanglyipblack bamboo banglyip according to the daejunencyclopedia of laws on ruling

as indicated we can see that before imjinwaeranjapanese invasion on the imjin year of 1592 the banglip was used for ajuns people without governmental positions and for the common cloths of hyanglislocal lower level government workers after imjinwaeran it can be seen that there are no records of ajuns and other low rank government officials using the banglip suggesting that the banglip had been mostly phased out

however the banglip was still used for farmers and men in mourning in pictures of the late chosun dynasty show merchants and specific situations of women leaving the house wearing the banglip showing that the hat was used for utilitarian reasons of blocking rain or sun rather then to indicate rank of the individual

the relics left of banglips show that the outer layer was made of thin bamboo and the insides were made of interwoven wanggola reed with four petal form decorations on the brim but some relics showed that struts to hold the banglip in place was found in only certain hats

the banglip is commonly woven with bamboo and wanggol reeds but some relics show wrappings of burlap on the brim which is to prevent the brim from becoming damaged

the diameter of the banglip was often around the shoulder width of a man or slightly wider compared to this banglip worn by women were large enough to cover the torse without stabilizing struts and in gaesung there was a tradition of women traveling long distances wearing the aformentioned large banglips instead of common cloth coverings used in other areas of the korean peninsula

clothes worn with the banglip are either dopotraditional male clothing of the aristocracy or traditional clothes with wide sleeves and in the late chosun period worn with more simplified clothingdurumagi or pants and a top indicating the banglip was used as headgear mostly by men in mourning and traveling merchants

the banglip is an outdoors hat more elaborate than a satgat with its outer layer made of thin split bamboo inner layer padded with wangol reed in a cone shape with the petal shaped decorations on the brim

during the early chosun period it was used as head coverings for low ranking officials but went out of usage after mid chosun with only traveling merchants and mourners wearing the banglip a large form of banglip that covered the face and a part of the torso was used in the gaesung region when women left the home for long periods

the formal term is yipmohatgats hat and is sometimes called woomorain hat the tip is pointed and the bottom is open in a circular form so when open it is shaped like a cone and when folded it is shaped like a folded hand fan

it is made of oiled paper that is either called galmojigalmo paper or hwanji with thin bamboo supports on the folds and a rooster crest like decoration on the top a string is attached on 2 points of the brim which is placed under the chin to secure the galmo in place above the gat during rain

gyeonggi,bike theft planning 4 rivers tour next year,"hi

we are in the early stages of planning to ride the 4 rivers trail from incheon to busan next spring were from canada and this will be our first trip to korea

as we plan to spend a couple of days in seoul id like to get advice on how to avoid theft  looks like it was a real problem a few years ago not so bad today one scenario would be that we leave our bikes back at the airbnbhotel and travel on foot  public transit in the city or you think that unattractive touring bikes pose little risk as long as they are locked



bonus question  our current plan is to ride out of the airport and take the ferry to wolmido rather than taking the subway opinionadvice"

when youre being turned away from businesses like restaurants cafes or hotels or youre being barred from participating in activities like renting picnic baskets or doing tours solely based on the fact that  youre a foreigner you can see its not only frustrating but  discriminatory p told the korea herald

i havent personally experienced this lately but i have experienced this i tried to rent a hotel room while traveling and on occasion ive been told its sold out which is impossible the entire place is empty in a busy hotel district or the cost of the room is more than the listed price on the placard or all the cheap rooms are sold out and only the expensive ones are vacant i hope these extreme situations are not happening but we have to ask are we inching towards holocaust badges now perhaps foreigners dont actually need them as koreans can tell who is a foreigner and who is a national perhaps vaxbadges are on the horizon for foreigners or maybe foreigners will have to wear a scarlet letter humans are just a crisis away from backsliding into the 1600s at all times

the british embassy has made clear to the national government and to  the seoul and gyeonggi administrations that we consider these measures  are not fair they are not proportionate nor are they likely to be  effective british ambassador simon smith said in a video posted on his twitterhttpstwittercomsimonsmithfcdo account  
  
the national human rights commission of korea also denounced the local governments decision saying that policies to exclude or separate out immigrants can lead to negative perceptions and  discrimination against them and shake the foundation of social integration solidarity and trust leading to racebased hate crimes

so when the hagwon comes up with policies such as making foreignersonly submit and sign their travel itinerary before the weekend or vacation or divulge it upon return be told to stay away from crowded areas restricted travel outside their gu area are spied and snitched on for not following rules only have to be tested for covid are fired for catching covid while koreans are not those policies are not exclusive to 10000 hagwons those extra harassment standards are not passed down from the legislature are not enforced by the police may not even be legal at all but are put in place because of the general foreignerphobia that exists in the culture really disappointing events in the age of covid and i can just imagine the massive lawsuits that would flow like water if this was done against koreans in western countries

sad stuff right here

 seoul jan 30  south korea039s daily covid19 cases reached an alltime high of 17532 on sunday amid a rapid spread of the highly transmissible omicron variant as people headed to their hometowns or went on trips during the lunar new year holiday

 the country reported 17532 new covid19 infections including 17303 local cases raising the total to 828637 the korea disease control and prevention agency said

 the government urged people to refrain from traveling during the holiday to prevent the spread of covid19 warning the infection tally could surge to as many as 100000 a day in the next several weeks

 the kdca said the revised regime is designed to minimize critical cases and deaths while preventing an overload and collapse of the medical system

 of the locally transmitted cases sunday gyeonggi province that surrounds seoul reported 5662 new covid19 cases followed by seoul with 4157 and the western port city of incheon with 1306

 the number of fully vaccinated people came to 44 million people accounting for 86 percent

gyeonggi,why does the red 9501 gyeonggi bus cost more than the other red bus lines,the 9501 isnt a double decker bus and it doesnt have usb charging support that the 3000 bus has yet it costs 2650 won while the other buses cost 2400 won to top it off going to gangnam on the 9501 bus is an extra 100200 won depending on what bus stop i take i live in gimpo saudong so its not that far the 3000 and 8600 buses can travel about the same distance to other parts of seoul without an additional fee what makes the 9501 so special

gyeonggi,weirdo foreigners in korea southern gyeonggido edition,"a few days ago a weirdo foreigner decided to post the original weirdo foreigners post from this subreddit on a popular facebook group their goal was apparently to encourage other foreigners to flame the admin here and invade the subreddit there was tons of flaming on facebook but the post also seems to have made several more people aware of this awesome community welcome to this wonderful judgment free zone

one of my close friends saw the post on facebook and asked me if i would be willing to share our experiences with weirdo foreigners here on the hagwonblacklistkorea subreddit my friend is definitely an advocate for the equality of foreigners here in korea including english teachers thats what led us to establish a language exchange community in our city to allow foreigners and koreans to learn each others languages and find true friends however we have encountered some truly strange characters these past six years ill start by discussing one of the most problematic people weve met

five years ago we met a canadian woman at our language exchange meetup for the purposes of anonymity ill refer to her as the canadian woman here my friend is a korean man so english is not his native language the canadian woman would publically mock him for his lack of english proficiency she also refused to acknowledge or appreciate any feedback korean members gave her regarding her pronunciation or grammar this subreddit tends to focus on how korean hagwon management mistreats foreign teachers however the rude behavior of the canadian woman is evidence that the disrespect is sometimes directed towards innocent people here in korea

in addition to her maltreatment of the language exchange members she was also quite rude to her fellow english teachers she publically admitted one of her goals of teaching english in korea was to one day meet and marry a korean man however when i openly admitted i had a desire to date a korean woman she accused me of only being interested in one night stands i dont discourage others from engaging in promiscuous behavior but i never had a one night stand in my entire life additionally when another foreigner bragged about sleeping with multiple women and showed off a list of their english and korean names and how many times they had relations the canadian woman said his behavior was perfectly acceptable in her mind its fine to treat women like trophies or pokemon as long as youre not me i guess

my friend and i decided to move our language exchange to suwon since our town was too small to attract many regular members the canadian woman got angry at us and stated that she would never attend the new meetup because suwon is too far in reality its about a 30 minute commute from where she lived my best friend had the misfortune of living and working with the canadian woman at this time she told him several times that she was upset about not being able to meet men in our community its impossible to feel sorry for her lack of success in dating when she wasnt willing to take a short commute to a bigger city the majority of my dates happened in suwon because i didnt use distance as an excuse to stay single im sure there are many foreigners with a similar mentality to the canadian woman some cities may not have a great dating scene for young adults but if theyre not willing to travel a bit for a date then i cant feel sorry for them

one day my friend invited my friends and i to an impromptu get together at a cafe since he happened to be downtown the canadian woman heard about the meeting and made an assumption that it was a language exchange that she wasnt invited to she proceeded to walk into the cafe and scream while swearing at my friend publically in broad daylight the staff and customers were very disturbed by her behavior it would be unacceptable anywhere in the world but korean culture in particular frowns upon confrontation and yelling in public my friend never received an apology for his traumatic experience at the cafe either

based on these anecdotes the canadian woman was a very strange antisocial person its difficult living abroad but she rejected community from both local korean people and her fellow foreigners as well her rude behavior in public especially swearing and yelling surely damaged the reputation of english teachers within our town 

on a broader scale within the hagwon industry she defended the shady business practices of her hagwons management until the government forcibly shut down the entire micky mouse operation for example when my then current job did nothing to prevent korean staff members from harassing my coworkers and i the canadian woman simply said all those american teachers will just be out of korea in a year anyways its offensive to be a bystander to the corruption of hagwons but its downright criminal to encourage the corruption while other foreign teachers suffer and continue to be exploited

i hope that my fellow members on this subreddit can reflect on the negative impact the canadian woman caused within both korean and expat society there are thousands of decent innocent english teachers here in korea that are being exploited by their bosses and isolated from other foreigners if the situation is going to improve on either front we must be proactive if we work together we can expose corruption we can also treat our fellow foreigners with kindness and respect to help ease their pain while working at hagwons where theyre essentially indentured servents

i have six years of stories to share here perhaps next time ill talk about the aussie boomer"

 fc seoul won their playoff against k league 2s busan ipark  
 seongnam fc were promoted from k league 2  
 ulsan won their champions league playoff and are in the group stages

its impossible to write a concise summary of the 2018 season  you can get some of the details from the club guide below  but one of the most interesting stories actually comes from k league 2

for context you need to understand a bit about military service for footballers rather than take 2 years out of their career to serve in the military or do some kind of eg desk job service players can join one of two military football teams that play in the k league in k league 1 there is sangju sangmu and in k league 2 there is asan mugunghwa every player in these two teams is on loan for two years from another club in the k league sangju sangu is affiliated with the normal military whilst asan mugunghwa is affiliated with the police serving in the auxilliary police force is another way to do your service

the korean government recently decided to abolish the auxilliary police force by 2023 the police however decided to already wind down their sports teams putting an immediate halt on recruiting players and disbanding the teams in 2019

now the champions of k league 2 last season were asan mugunghwa they were in line for direct promotion to k league 1 to compete in the k league you need to have at least 20 players but by the time the next season started asan would only have 14 players as the loan deals ran out the league gave asan a deadline in november to submit a recruitment plan which they failed to do and so the promotion spot passed to secondplaced seongnam fc although that deadline and hence promotion was missed asan have how submitted a recruitment plan that would see their 14 serving players be supplemented by new signings that indicates the club will transition to an cityowned club with the help of the asan government

funnily or depressingly this is not the first time police fc won k league 2 and missed out on promotion  in 2016 ansan mugunghwa were crowned champions but at the end of that year moved from ansan to asan in line with the leagues policies they were registered as a brand new club

k league 1 club guide

clubs can have up to three foreign players in their squad plus an extra one from another afc nation although rare a player with north korea citizenship is not considered foreign most of those foreign places are taken by brazilians or players from the former yugoslavia eg k league veteran dejan damjanovic the exception to the foreigner rule is the goalkeeper  korean goalkeepers in the 90s were just so bad that a block on recruiting foreign goalieshttpwwwkleagueunitedcom201703foreigngoalkeepersinfavourofhtml was put in place to help encourage development of domestic talent it seems to have worked with korean goalkeepers often being signed abroad in asia at least

there is also a requirement to have u23 players fielded and on the bench with a failure to meet this impacting the number of substitutes that can be made article 30httpswwwkleaguecomaboutcompetition of the league rules

youll notice some of the clubs have a korean chaebol in their team name and even if its not in the name they may still be owned by a corporation behind the scenes this sounds very odd if youre not familiar with it but it is extremely common in japan china and korea it may just be a symptom of some of the teams being relatively recentlyfounded and perhaps isnt that unusual these days think red bull city group majority shareholders in the west however the number of citizen clubs owned by the local city or provincial government is on the rise  gyeongnam fc is one example

a lot of clubs probably like to think they have a derby with fc seoul because well its seoul but the  biggest and probably considered the national derby is the super match  between fc seoul and suwon samsung bluewings montenegrin damjanovic known simply as dejan formerly of seoul and now playing for suwon is the top scorer in this fixture

heres the clubs by last seasons standing and since crests are a bit unstable on reddit at the moment heres an imgur album of all club crests and corresponding home kits for the 2019 seasonhttpimgurcomaw8dbla5

jeonbuk hyundai motors

jeonbuk are the dominant team in korea and one the of the teams you dont want to face in the champions league whoever you are theyve now won 4 out of the last 5 k league 1 titles and a most recent champions league title in 2016

their rise to power over the last decade has been overseen by long term manager choi kanghee choi left at the end of last season to tianjin quanjintianhai daliang yifang fc in china korea seems to have a thing for portuguese managers these days and his replacement is one jos morais morais was assistant manager to jos mourinho for a period but as manager proper hes been a bit shit he was at two clubs in 2018 which included ushering barnsley into relegation to english league one how jeonbuk will fare after choi remains to be seen

although jeonbuk cruised to the league title it would be difficult to call their season an outright success due to a horrendous 15 mins at the end of the second half in a home match against suwon in the champions league quarterfinal they turned the 3 goal deficit around in the seond leg when they travelled to suwon but went out on penalties 

gyeongnam fc

gyeongnam were only promoted from k league 2 the previous season so coming second in k league 1 is something special top scorer in the league marco played his part with 26 goals

gyeongnam will now feature in the champions league for the first time i thought that seems to have put the brakes on too many of their players departing but captain choi youngjun signed for jeonbuk in the winter transfer window a major loss is marco who was also top scorer in k league 2 in the year they were promoted who appears to have followed the money to china also off to china is key centreback park jisoo so basically the backbone of the team from defence to attack has left

ulsan hyundai

known as the horangi   the tigers  ulsan have had intermittent success in asia winning the champions league for the first and only time in 2012 in an unbeaten run

towards the end of the 2018 season ulsan were battling gyeongnam for the second spot which brings with it direct qualification to the champions league group stages rather than having a playoff they lost out but were widely expected to secure a direct qualification spot anyway when they faced daegu fc in the fa cup final ultimately they finished the season on a low losing 51 on aggregate to daegu in the final 

pohang steelers

one of the few clubs that predates the formation of the k league pohang are another of the historical korean powerhouses they hold the record for the most number of champions league title 3 but their last title came in 2009

finishing fourth in the league they were hoping that ulsan would beat daegu in the fa cup final to pass their champions league spot on down but it didnt happen

jeju united

one of the original members of the k league founded as the yukong elephants in the seoul area as part of the decentralisation program they moved to bucheon kind of and were renamed as bucheon sk the decision to move to jeju in 2006 was an abrupt one and understandably deeply unpopular with the fans teams uprooting and moving elsewhere is a bit of a catalyst for the creation of new teams in korea and the fans formed bucheon fc 1995 in the absence of bucheon sk

the reason given for the relocation was to the address the imbalance in football teams being located around seoulgyeonggido and jeju did not have a pro team at the time but there are suggestions the owners sk group wanted to cut their investment and recoup some costs

there were recent rumours that jeju would move yet again back north to yongin but who knows 

jeju had a pretty mediocre season what more can i say

suwon samsung bluewings

suwons 2018 season was a bit bonkers and especially so in their champions league run

in their champions league group in which they were drawn with eventual winners kashima antlers suwon did not manage a single home win however they had managed to get two away wins and going into the final match they still had their fate in their own hands if they could win against group leaders kashima in japan they won 10 getting three away wins and topping the group

manager seo jungwon at a time when suwon were 4th in the league resigned the day before the first leg of their champions league quarterfinal clash with jeonbuk due to fan protests jeonbuk were apparently completely bamboozled by this event and took a 30 beating at home then in the return leg in suwon jeonbuk fought back to win 30 but suwon were able to scrape through on penalties to face kashima antlers yet again in the semis

in the semifinal fixture suwon went 20 up against kashima antlers inside the first 10 minutes but went on to lose 32 in the first leg
soon after manager seo returned as suddenly as he had departed having been gone for just 6 weeks  
in the second leg suwon went a goal down in the first half but came back with 3 in the second half to be on their way to the final after 60 mins played however kashima antlers fought back to get two more goals and win 65 on aggregate and would go on to win the final if you want to relive a part of that rollercoaster night here you gohttpsyoutuberxy8pagy1aq and heres an idea of the atmosphere that nighthttpstwittercomtheafcclstatus1055055104607285248

at one point it looked like they might qualify for the champions league again for the 2019 season but suwon didnt win any of their final five league matches and dropped to 6th

manager seo left again at the end of the season and will manage japans sagan tosu recently captain kim eunsun was released from the club for drinkdriving the drama just never ends

daegu fc

prior to the world cup daegu were languishing at the bottom of the table but after the return they found some kind of consistent form helped out by world cup hero goalkeeper jo hyeonwoo they really peaked at the right time as daegu made it to the fa cup final and against the odds defeated ulsan hyundai 51 on aggregate meaning for the first time they will feature in the champions league this is no mean feat for team whose best ever finish in the top flight is 7th place if they carry over their momentum into the 2019 season the year could be one of their most successful ever they will also be playing in a new footballspecific stadium this year

gangwon fc

gangwon are a fairly midbottom team i dont really know what to say about them they did have the 2ndhighest top scorer in the 2018 season though bosnian uros deric they also had the worst colour scheme in the league last season their kit is slightly improved this season

incheon united

i always like to imagine that incheon chose their strip so that they could be the inter to fc seouls ac milan they even have a nickname nerazzurri another nickname is the durumi    the cranes

incheon spent most of the 2018 season at the very bottom of table and had the jointleakiest defence in the league they brought in norwegian manager jrn andersen midway through the season to turn their fortunes around but even after that they were on the wrong end or the biggest thrashing of the season 70 against gangwon coming into the end of the season though they were playing really nice attacking football even if they didnt always get the result at the split they were still bottom but won 4 out of 5 games to pull themselves up 3 places

it was in attack that incheon shone montenegrin stefan mugosa was their top scorer in his debut season moon seonmin with the best goal celebration in the league also put in a strong performance but has now signed for champions jeonbuk nam junjae returned in the summer to score some bangers costa rican international aguilar was also impressive but has signed for jeju in the new season

sangju sangmu

the military team where other k league players get loaned to to complete their military service their history goes far back in one sense as various military teams were playing way back to the 50s but they were founded for pro footballers to serve their time only in 1984 although they were for pro players they competed in the semipro national league until 2003 when they joined the k league based in gwangju when gwangju fc were formed they moved to sangju

sangju sangmu do not have any foreign players for obvious reasons and cannot compete in the champions league although the chances of ever finishing in a qualifying spot are fairly slim

fc seoul

fc seoul wow what happened having won the league in 2016 albeit somewhat fortuitously and always finishing in the top half if not competing for the title in the past decade nobody expected seoul to be fighting against relegation although relatively solid defensively they scored the least number of goals in the league season of all teams their star foreign players almost all left before the season started including dejan to rivals suwon and were not replaced with the same quality and for many matches seoul played with an allkorean team one bit of good news for the future is that former captain osmar will return from his loan to cezero osaka for the new season

seoul at least managed to avoid relegation by beating busan ipark over two legs in the playoff helped by a red card in the first leg surprisingly they managed to score 3 goals in the first leg in open play

seoul is probably the most popular club in korea im sure helped by the fact that it is the main club in a city of 10 million people  seoul generally has the highest game attendances although it was much reduced last season because they were so crap

starting out as luckygoldstar ie lg fc in chungcheong province the team was permitted to relocate to seoul at the start of the 90s and were renamed as lg cheetahs during the decentralisation period they moved to anyang modifying their name to anyang lg cheetahs after the world cup the team successfully negotiated a move back to seoul and did away with their cheetahs moniker taking their current name fc seoul their founding and rebirth years are both on their badge  1983 and 2004

seongnam fc

gaining direct promotion due to asan mugunghwas situation seongnam is actually the most decorated team in korea

founded in 1989 in seoul as ilhwa chunma they were forced out of seoul and settled in cheonnan for a period in 2000 they moved to seongnam a satellite city of seoul and appended the city name to the name of the club seongnams title drought started when the head of the owner company that backed seongnam died in 2012 and the board were keen to let go of the club seongnam city government took over ownership of the club for the 2014 season and they were renamed seongnam fc seongnam are now back in k league 1 after a 2 year absence

k league 2 clubs

by last seasons standings

jeonnam dragons

jeonbuks jeolla province rivals they finished the previous season on an awful losing streak and were relegated for the first time

asan mugunghwa

police fc they missed promotion despite winning k league 2 and will probably lose their police affiliation by next year

busan ipark

one of the founding members of the k league and another that effectively predates the k league busan were beaten by k league 1 opposition in the prorel playoff for the second year in a row they were the first korean team to win the asian continental title in the 80s

daejeon citizen

one of the first communitycityowned clubs in korea

gwangju fc

relegated in the 2017 season despite finishing 5th in 2018 they still got to participate in the playoffs due to asan mugunghwas situation

fc anyang

founded in 2013 finally filling the void left by the departure of fc seoul from the city

suwon fc

the other suwon team they featured in k league 1 briefly in 2016

bucheon fc 1995

formed after the departure of jeju united from the city formed in 2007 1995 refers to the year of the organising of the yukong elephant fan club including 1995 in the name is meant to show its a club for the fans or something

bucheon fc 1995 are also one half of the 032 derby with incheon united because they share the same area code 032

ansan greeners fc

formed only in 2017 theyve had two 9thposition finishes

seoul eland fc

the other seoul team their debut season was in 2015 they didnt do very well last season although it was very tight at the bottom of the table

winter transfer window activity

from a monetary point of view korea is the biggest net exporterhttpsenynacokrviewaen20190131006600315sectionsportsindex of players in asia in the transfer market this winter window was no different with what i would say were the two biggest stories involving young homegrown korean talent going abroad

the first is that of jeonbuk and national team star centreback kim minjae nicknamed the monster there were rumours of an offer from english side watford but it wasnt clear if there ever was any offer or negotiations  kim himself said he did not know of any interest from watford it doesnt really matter now  kim signed with chinese side beijing sinobo guoan and will see champions league football with them in the new season being drawn in the same group as jeonbuk

the second is hwang inbeom who has signed for mls side vancouver whitecaps hwang inbeom played in k league 2 last season with asan mugunghwa and daejeon citizen but has impressed as a midfield playmaker and is currently seen as a replacement for ki sungyueng in the national team

for a recognisable name for western readers the best i have is englishman jordon mutch who signed for gyeongnam from crystal palace resulting in this awkward photo ophttpspbstwimgcommediadzg3adzvyaakrkqformatjpgnamemedium another recognisable name is mix diskerud on loan to ulsan from man city but he joined the previous year

k league 1s top scorer marco left gyeongnam for hebei china fortune and his replacement is luc castaignos signed from sporting cp his stats in europe havent been great in recent years but he may fare better in korea

there were of course a few hundred domestic internal transfers and number of other foreign player signings  if you want the full list k league uniteds winter transfer trackerhttpwwwkleagueunitedcom2019012019kleaguewintertransfertrackerhtml has it all



history of club football in korea  establishment of the k league

association football was first introduced to korea in 1882 when british royal navy crew harboured at incheon played a game it wasnt until the 1900s that football began to take hold and the first public match was played in 1905 there was a boom in in the 1910s with a number of football clubs being formed and rivalries began to form between clubs in seoul and pyongyang

the first nationwide competition was the all joseon football tournament joseon being the name for korea at the time founded in 1921 there wasnt actually a champion crowned in 1921 as the tournament was cut short due to complaints over refereeing decisions all this was taking place during japanese occupation of korea during most of the first half of the 20th century

according to the kfahttpswebarchiveorgweb20170606162658httpkfaorkrrecordhistoryasp football was the only tonic that could relieve the the national resentment that had accumlated in the hearts as a colony under the japanese empire and was a sprout that could foster the hope of freedom a tad hyperbolic maybe

one side effect of being a japanese colony is that some korean teams were allowed to participate in the emperors cup japans fa cup and in 1935 kyungsung fc kyungsung was a name for seoul during japanese occupation won the tournament becoming the only nonjapanese team to ever do so

the all joseon football tournament ran until wwii

after wwii came korean independence and shortly thereafter the korean war there was football being played during this period continuously when possible the korean national semiprofessional football league was founded in 1964 and is the predecessor to todays tier 3 national league many of the teams during this period were works teams  employed by a company playing under the name of the company but also having a proper job in the company cha bumkun said by some to be the greatest ever asian footballer rose to fame during this period albeit mainly in the bundesliga starting his senior career at the mighty seoul trust bank fc the most astonishing statistic about cha bumkun is he only received one yellow card in his career

finally we get to the establishment of professional football with the korean super league in 1983 now named the k league initially there were only 5 teams and 2 of those teams dropped out within 2 years the number of clubs in the top flight has varied from the initial 5 to a high of 16 in 2011 in 2013 the k league split into two tiers now k league 1 and k league 2

for the first few years of the k league teams did not have a fixed home stadium that they played in because there was no standard homeaway format that we are so familiar with today instead it was operated as a national tour

the k league in the modern era has its own history but one of the most interesting events was the forced exodus of all three clubs from seoul in 1996 as part of a policy to spread the popularity of football around the country also with an eye on stadium infrastructure for the 2002 world cup two of the clubs didnt move far only just outside the city of seoul each to one of seouls satellite cities yukong elephants only halfleft because the city they moved to didnt have a stadium yet so they continued to play in seoul until a new stadium was built for a number of years the k league was without any seoul representation in 2004 after the need to find someone to fill a great big national football stadium and help pay towards it one of those relocated teams moved back to seoul becoming fc seoul



football pyramid  league format

the current system looks like this


 tier  league  notes 

 1  k league 1 12 teams 1 relegation to k league 2 1 relegation playoff with k league 2
 2  k league 2  10 teams 1 promotion to k league 1 1 promotion playoff with k league 2
 3  national league  8 teams semipro no promotionrelegation
 4  k3 league advanced  12 teams semiproamateur 2 relegations to k3 league basic 1 relegation playoff with k3 league basic 
 5  k3 league basic 11 teams semiproamateur 2 promotions to k3 league advanced 1 promotion playoff with k3 league advanced 
 6 division 5 league 6 regional leagues with 52 teams some relegation to division 6 
 7  division 6 league 26 regional leagues with 174 teams some prorel with divisions 5  7 
 8  division 7 league 160 regional leagues with 960 teams some promotion with division 6 

as you can see the naming is completely screwed up  k3 league occupies tiers 4 and 5 and division 5 is in tier 6 this is probably because the top tier k league only split in two in 2013 with the creation on k league 2 and nobodys been bothered to update their names

the national league sits stubbornly in tier 3 blocking any continuous prorel the powers that be have regularly stated that they want to reform the pyramid to have a continuous route from top to bottom at least to the bottom of k3 league within a few years but for some reason its not happening the winners of the 2006 national league season were offered promotion to the k league but they declined the offer the winners of the 2007 season were also offered promotion but declined again even though they said they would like promotion at the start of the season

one of the more recent additions to the k league bucheon fc 1995 joined from k3 league because they didnt want to pay the higher fees associated with starting out in the national league

outside of this system there is the wk league the womens top tier the wk league has been dominated by incheon red angels no connection to incheon united in recent years theres no womens champions league in asia yet but for a few years in the past the winners of the wk league played the winners of japans nadeshiko league for a little more info on the wk league see this reddit posthttpswwwredditcomrwomenssoccercommentsaqkew5southkoreasroutetotheworldcupthewkleague

also worth a mention is the separate u league for universities and colleges some of the teams from which enter into the korean fa cup the route into a pro team in korea is often direct from high school or university teams something i dont think exists in europe some high school teams are even seen as feeder teams for a particular pro team i wont pretend to understand how the system works but ill leave you with the tidbit that park jisung was first signed to a professional team from a university team almost by accident as the scout had come to see a different player but took home park instead

k league 1

k league 1 consists of 12 teams playing 38 games the format is identical to the scottish premiership  all teams play each other three times and then after the split the top 6 and bottom 6 battle it out among themselves to settle the championship and relegation spots respectively the first tie breaker for teams level on points is goals scored rather than goal difference

the top 3 places offer a chance in the afc champions league the fourth champions league spot going to the winner of the korean fa cup bottom place gets relegated to k league 2 whilst 11th place has a playoff with one of the teams that finished 2nd4th in k league 2

international context

in the current format of the afc champions league the competition is split into a west region think uae saudi arabia qatar iran and an east region the east region is dominated by three nations  korea china and japan australia who decided it wanted to be asian earlier this century has also had a bit of success

this year there will be two debutants from korea  gyeongnam fc and daegu fc its dufficult to predict how well these two will fare but if they can carry some form over to this year they could get out of the group stages at least

determining who has the strongest teams amongst the big three east asian nations is a difficult task and is hugely subjective im almost i say almost because obviously k league is best league of the opinion that theyre as close to equal as makes no difference korea has the most number of titles and the club with the most titles pohang steelers china have the highest coefficient japan has won the past two tournaments

in recent years china and japan have had a number of big star foreigner signings eg paulinho torres which are absent from the k league i believe this is due to japan having cash mainly coming from tv money and china having cash from well being china despite korea lagging financially all three nations have the same limit on foreign players three foreigners plus one from another afc country and so korean teams are still competitive due to the relative strength of their domestic players

while were on the topic of the champions league each of the big three east asian nations get 4 places total  2 or 3 to the group stages and 1 or 2 to the last qualifying playoff round before the group stages this playoff round is massively weighted in the big threes favour as they have to win just one home game when the weather is still genrally freezing cold against a team from a nation with a tropical climate i dont know of a korean club ever losing this playoff match

the afc cup is sometimes said to be the equivalent of uefas europa league but its not really comparable the afc cup is for the weaker asian nations only and korea arent allowed to enter



resources

websites  podcasts

for those of us who are linguistically challenged heres how you can follow k league in english

one of the best websites for news match previews and analysis is k league unitedhttpwwwkleagueunitedcom it covers everything  k league 1  2 fa cup transfer news national team and more it also has a podcast if youre into that sort of thing

a really good resource for uptodate breaking news is an english version of a korean news outlet the sports category of yonhap newshttpsenynacokrsportsindex for example is great although youll be getting other sports news in there such as korean baseball football appears pretty regularly also the team that works on writing the articles dont seem to work weekends

tavern of the taeguk warriorshttpwwwtaegukwarriorscom has a lot of information mainly on the korean national team and tracks the progress of koreans playing in europe but covers the domestic club scene now and then

48 shades of footballhttps48shadesblogcom is a great english language podcast following korean football

the asian gamehttpswwwtheasiangamenet is another great english language podcast that doesnt specifically follow korean football but since they cover asian football theyll sometimes have indepth coverage of the korean clubs competing in the afc champions league as well as the korean national team

for your twitter fix the korea football news korfootballnewshttpstwittercomkorfootballnews and viva la kleague kleagueno1httpstwittercomkleagueno1 twitter feeds are pretty quick with breaking news in english 

there is also the official k league websitehttpwwwkleaguecom which can be viewed in english but i think unless you live in korea its going to be painfully slow to use

then of course theres rkleague with news and discussion and where you can ask questions to the community

highlights  watching live

all highlights from k league 1 matches are uploaded fairly promptly to the spotv youtube channelhttpswwwyoutubecomuserspotv spotv is a korean sports broadcaster they also upload content from the kbo baseball and the v league volleyball so youll have to scroll down until you see something saying k1 it helps if you know how korean letters sound phonetically to understand which teams are playing but you can also see which match a video is from the crests in the thumbnail the commentary will be in korean but each video is really good quality typically about 10 minutes long

if you watch to watch live the good news is that is very easy and basically free i have no idea whether any national broadcasters or streaming services around the world have k league rights but in korea itself essentia"
gyeonggi,traveling to south korea where should i check out,"so ill be traveling to seoul and  hwaseong gyeonggi  for work  ill be there for about six weeks  what are some of the things i should try and see or do

gyeonggi,for those who live in seoul or its surrounding area and commute exclusively by subway take a look at the monthly commuter pass  ,"heres what it looks like httpsimg1daumcdnnetthumbr720x0q80scodemtistoryfnamehttp3a2f2fcfile22uftistorycom2fimage2f2574f74c58ca3e031d5b28

this will apply only if you live and work at a place that is within walking distance to a subway station 

for anywhere between 55000 won to 102900 won you get a total of 60 rides that are good for 30 days this comes out to less than 920 won per ride if youre traveling within the boundary for zone 1  if i use an analogy with seoul this is within the city boundaries this  is in contrast to the base fare of 1250 up to 1450 won per ride if you were to go from one end of seoul to the other 

if you live in the parts of gyeonggi province that have subway access and need to commute to seoul it comes out to less than 1720 won per ride as opposed to the 2750 won youd pay to go from one end of line 1 to the other 

there are different fare levels depending on how far you live for example if you live near bucheon station and work near incheon station you can get away with zone 1 prices 

downsides

 no transferring from the subway to the bus this is only for subway rides 
 there is an exception for stations on the airport express line  no discount there even if you have a job at icn to my understanding theres a separate commuter card for it 
 you cant use your commuter card for that occasional trip beyond your zone unless you want to pay dearly by forfeiting one or more of your allotted rides edit to reflect ucaodalts comment however you can travel shorter distances than the maximum zone boundary 
 commuter cards with lower zones may not be able to get on the shinbundang line 

summary if you ride the subway exclusively no bus to get to the station to get around save some cash by getting a monthly commuter pass "

gyeonggi,covid19 in the world vaccine and new restrictions,"the coronavirus pandemic has killed at least more than 16 million people worldwide since december 2019 according to the latest figures from johns hopkins university local authorities have officially diagnosed around 72 million cases to date the united states remains the country most affected by covid19 with nearly 300000 deaths brazil follows with more than 181000 india over 143000 mexico almost 114000 and italy more than 64000 in north africa especially libya tunisia and algeria the virus is already out of control despite the restrictive measures the lack of control by the central authorities has made the tracking of infections lose sight furthermore the social stigma and religious approach to the pandemic among the population have meant that many infected people have not carried out any tests

us president donald trump has already made it known that he will stick to his america first also with regard to the vaccine according to the new york times white house staff members who work closely with us president donald trump will be among the first in the country to receive the coronavirus vaccine after the approval of pfizers vaccine by the food and drug administration fdahttpstheworldreviewscomfdaapprovespfizerbiontechcovid19vaccineforemergencyuse the distribution of the vaccine began in the united states yesterday for now the vaccination is limited to highrisk workers in the facilities hospital and welfare the trump administration aims to stop the infections that have occurred at the top of the executive power in recent months the goal is to get the entire staff of the white house to be vaccinated

the united kingdom is the first in europe to administer the vaccine to risk groups the provider of services for the british health system nhs providers said it was concerned about the trend of infections in england asking that further restrictions be introduced without any delay under penalty of overwhelming hospitals by a third wave of covid infections 19 the providers in a letter sent to british prime minister boris johnson asked the government to exercise extreme caution in the review of the tiered restrictions system scheduled for wednesday december 16 and to have no hesitation in including areas of the nation london as well under the most stringent level 3 restrictions as soon as the number of infections made it immediately necessary the most worrying factor according to the nhs is that the increases seen in some areas of the uk come at the end of a second national quarantine

germany launches the christmas squeeze between next wednesday december 16 and january 10 the lockout of all nonessential shops and services the closure of schools or in any case the obligation of distance lessons only grocery stores pharmacies and banks remain open travel is not recommended the home office is suggested religious ceremonies and masses are subject to severe limits angela merkel announced yesterday at the end of the brief meeting with the land during a press conference with the minister of finance olaf scholz and the governors of berlin and bavaria michael mueller and markus soeder we need to act urgently underlined the chancellor adding that the goal is to return to 50 infections per 100 thousand inhabitants

the first covid19 vaccine landed on canadian soil on sunday canada and the united states will be the first western nations after the united kingdom to start vaccinations the first batch of doses of pfizerbiontechs covi19 vaccine has arrived in canada prime minister justin trudeau wrote on twitter sunday night where he posted a photo of a cargo plane being used to carry the vaccine developed by pfizer inc and germanys biontech se as for the uk canada government affirmed that the initial 30000 doses are reserved for the most vulnerable people including the elderly in longterm care facilities and healthcare workers nearly 300000 doses were expected by the end of the year general dany fortin responsible for the distribution of the vaccines told canadian broadcasting corp

despite the good news trudeau said our fight against covid19 is not over  canadian federal health authorities expect a rapid acceleration of the covid19 spread that is why they asked the provinces on friday to impose additional health restrictions ahead of the holidays the country had over 460000 confirmed cases with nearly 6000 new infections reported only yesterday the pandemic leftover 13000 deaths in canada including 81 on saturday

south korea has ordered the closure of schools from tomorrow in the capital seoul and in the surrounding areas where the infections have exceeded the peak in february the korea disease control and prevention agency kdca yesterday reported 718 new cases of coronavirus down from the daily record increase of 1030 the previous day 682 are related to local transmission most of the new contagions were recorded in the seoul metropolis the nearby port city of incheon and in the province of gyeonggi which is home to over 25 million people

new zealand agreed on monday to allow nonquarantine travel with australia in the first quarter of 2021 nearly a year after blocking its borders to protect its population from the new coronavirus prime minister jacinda ardern said the government has agreed in principle on a nonquarantine transtasman travel bubble pending confirmation from the australian government and no significant change in circumstances in either country a transtasman travel bubble has been under discussion for months and many australian regions have allowed new zealanders to enter without quarantine requirements since october but new zealand had not reciprocated"

gyeonggi,travelling around korea for 34 weeks in aprilmay any suggestions,"im travelling with a friend for 12 weeks initially well be around the seoul area northern region in general the only thing on our itinerary right now is going on the hangang cycling route and hanging around seoul talking to locals and other travellers that sort of thing 

after that i will be off on my own and i intend to go around as many less touristy areas as possible i would say i like nature so any place with national parks or mountainous areas are good the general areas im looking at are gyeonggi gangwon north chungcheong south gyeongsang south jeolla i would like to go to the larger cities too so on my list right now theres seoul daejeon daegu gyeongju gwangju and busan plus the jirisan and seoraksan national parks i might want to go hiking at some point too and am looking at either the national parks andor the mountainseaside region near busan 

which would be the best way to travel around  bus rail or both also what are couchsurfing prospects like in places outside of seoul any suggestions for itinerary id prefer places that are off the usual beaten path for tourists someone has suggested daejeon for instance and places with natural scenery im not that interested in the cultural aspect but if theres a place thats very much worth visiting id love to find out more thanks"
gyeonggi,planning to leave epik  thoughts or options,"so im currently finishing my second year with epik in a rural city in gyeonggido 

this city has no subway and only intercity buses i am a christian and attend church weekly and i currently attend a branch of my home church in seoul which can take like 12 hours each way the shortest distance to pretty much any international church from this city is about 1 hour 
due to the nature of the city its quite hard to make friends and theres not a lot in terms of clubs or activities i do have a few friends but we dont meet that often i can speak decent korean so i am okay even with making friends who cant speak english but it doesnt change a huge amount 

after almost 2 years like this ive been feeling really lonely and isolated here within the city i spend so much time alone and its like a real journey to do anything outside of the city i was doing some volunteer work in seoul with my church before but i stopped because it was almost 34 hours of travelling just for 1 hour of volunteer work i am getting very tired of living like this 

my school here is amazing and if my situation were more ideal i would 100 stay here they really want me to renew as well and my house is nice and big but i feel like i will go crazy if i stay in this city for another year 

i have also applied for epik so i could change school but they rejected me and wouldnt tell me the reason which sucks so if i leave this city i have no choice but to leave epik 

ive been looking into different options in seoul it sounds like i would have to go for either hagwon or private school and i might try to get back into epik again later on 
ive heard a lot of horror stories of hagwons and private schools which make me nervous thats one of the main reasons that this is a hard decision for me ive heard lots of people say stuff like do research on the school make sure theres at least 5 native teachers and other stuff 

honestly part of me wants to stay but i know that i will like my job while being miserable outside of work for another year
i just honestly feel really overwhelmed right now and i dont know where to start 

has anyone experienced moving from epik to private any good starting points and links and stuff that would help "

gyeonggi,us south korea to begin joint training this week despite coronavirus concerns,"this is the best tldr i could make originalhttpswwwstripescomnewspacificussouthkoreatobeginjointtrainingthisweekdespitecoronavirusconcerns1641465 reduced by 77 im a bot

 seoul south korea  the united states and south korea will begin annual joint military exercises this week but they will be reduced in scope due to a spike in coronavirus cases officials said sunday

 the announcement came as south korea reported 279 new confirmed coronavirus cases the largest daily count since early march and the third consecutive day with triple digit figures

 the computersimulated combined command post training drill will be held from tuesday through aug 28 quotwhile taking into consideration the covid19 situationquot south korea039s joint chiefs of staff said in a statement

 us forces korea has had 152 confirmed cases including 128 service members and other personnel who tested positive after traveling to the south from abroad the influx prompted local authorities and activists in gyeonggi province which includes the main army base camp humphreys to call for the exercise to be canceled

 north korea usually lashes out against the joint exercises which it considers rehearsals for an invasion despite us and south korean insistence that they are defensive in nature

 american troops are stationed in south korea which technically remains at war with the north after their 195053 conflict ended in an armistice instead of a peace treaty

gyeonggi,south korea warns it is on brink of new covid crisis as church linked to outbreak,"this is the best tldr i could make originalhttpswwwtheguardiancomworld2020aug18southkoreawarnsitisonbrinkofnewcovidcrisisaschurchlinkedtooutbreakseoul reduced by 65 im a bot

 south korea has warned that it is on the brink of a new coronavirus crisis and could introduce stricter controls after a resurgence in cases including hundreds linked to a church in seoul

 having brought the initial outbreak under control in april through its quottrace test and treatquot approach south korea has added almost 1000 cases over the past five days

 officials have urged people in seoul and neighbouring gyeonggi province  home to nearly half the country039s 51 million people  to stay at home and avoid nonessential travel as a new cluster was identified among followers of a church in seoul

 more than 400 infections have been linked to sarang jeil church whose leader jun kwanghun is among those who have tested positive for covid19 yonhap said on monday

 the cluster linked to sarang jeil church has echoes of the early days of the pandemic in february when south korea identified what turned out to be its biggest cluster among followers of shincheonji church of jesus a secretive christian sect in the southeastern city of daegu

 lee manhee the 88yearold leader of shincheonji  which was linked to more than 5000 cases  was arrested for allegedly giving inaccurate records of church gatherings and false lists of its members to health authorities

 secretive church sect at the center of south koreas coronavirus outbreak

 anthony kuhn

 

south koreas government says it is in a critical struggle to contain the spread of the covid19 virus from the diseases epicenter in daegu it has given itself four weeks to stabilize the situation in the city of 25 million some 150 miles southeast of the capital seoul

if authorities fail to contain the spread of the covid19 in daegu there is a high possibility that covid19 could spread nationwide vice health minister kim ganglip toldhttpwwwkoreaheraldcomviewphpud20200224000754np1mp1 reporters on monday

most of south koreas 833 cases as of monday are in daegu and most are connected to an obscure religious group called the shincheonji church of jesus

case numbers doubled for several days in a row last week the virus spread to every major city and province in the country as a result the government on sunday raised the countrys virus alert level to red its highest for the first time since 2009 this gave authorities the power to shut down schools and restrict flights in and out of the country it also advised all citizens showing symptoms of respiratory ailments or fever to stay away from work and school and to selfquarantine

its not clear how many south koreans will heed that advice and its highly unlikely that the government could impose draconian restrictions locking down entire cities as in the case of china says kim woojoo a doctor in the department of infectious disease at korea universitys guro hospital in seoul

south korea is a liberal democracy with the freedom of movement he says besides he says any lockdown now would already be too late since daegu is a transport hub through which many people have already passed

the government and health authorities response has always been one step behind he adds

while neighboring japan has expanded its ban on travelers from chinas hubei province to include eastern zhejiang province for example south korea has not followed suit more than half a million people petitionedhttpswwwreuterscomarticleuschinahealthreactionsouthkoreasouthkoreanscallinpetitionforchinesetobebarredovervirusiduskbn1zr0qj south koreas presidential office last month to ban all visitors from china but seoul has balked apparently for economic and diplomatic reasons

despite the surge in case numbers kim does not believe the current situation warrants panic or despair he points out that south koreas wellregarded national health system has a solid track record of containing epidemics including sars severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 h1n1 in 2009 and mers middle east respiratory syndrome in 2015

one reason case numbers appear to have grown rapidly is because of the countrys ability to test large numbers of people quickly as of monday afternoon the health authorities had testedhttpswwwcdcgokrboardboardesmida20501000000bid0015listno366327actview 31923 people with 20292 tests coming back negative and 11631 results still pending

other countries that claim they have no cases kim says may actually lack the ability to detect them

if the government medical system and the people of south korea organize the resources we have well and cooperate then we can fully defeat this outbreak and it will eventually come to an end he says

health authorities are also focusing resources on the shincheonji church of jesus founded in 1984 by charismatic pastor lee manhee whose followers estimated at up to 240000 worldwide believe he is the messiah shincheonji is korean for new heaven and earth its critics say its a cult

authorities are not sure how the disease was first transmitted to the group but investigators have been looking into it more than 9000 shincheonji members have been put under quarantine and the government planshttpworldkbscokrservicenewsviewhtmlangeseqcode151557 to test all of them for the virus

critics say the disease may have spread within the church quickly because of the way that it worships shincheonji followers hold services sitting on the floor without any chairs packed together like bean sprouts says shin hyunuk director of the guri cult counseling center an organization in gyeonggi province that works to extract members from the church shin was a member of the shincheonji group for 20 years managing the churchs bible study instructors until 2006

a bigger problem is that they shout out amen after every sentence the pastor utters pretty much every few seconds and they do that at the top of their lungs sending respiratory droplets flying everywhere he adds these droplets are believed to transmit the coronavirus

he says that group members proselytize in secret without revealing their identity this is because many koreans are wary of the group and its reputation as a result this makes it difficult for people who may have been targeted to know whether theyve been in contact with a member of the sect because shincheonji members cannot reveal themselves they make it impossible for others to be cautious and selfquarantine themselves

critics allege that the church obstructed the coronavirus investigation by not cooperating with health authorities a petition on the presidential website which has garnered more than half a million signatures callshttpwwwkoreaheraldcomviewphpud20200224000676 on the government to forcibly disband the group

a spokesman for the shincheonji group said in a videotaped statement over the weekend that the church is fully cooperatinghttpswwwkoreatimescokrwwwnation202002119283920html with health authorities shutting down some 1100 churches nationwide and sharing lists of followers with authorities to help track down and quarantine potential coronavirus cases

the statement also said that the group was a victim of the virus and called for the public and media to refrain from unfairly criticizing it"

gyeonggi,new infections drop below 50 but pm warns against complacency,"korea herald

south korea reported 47 new cases of the novel coronavirus monday the  lowest number since late february still the trend toward more new  cases in the capital area has authorities on edge 

as of monday  at 1201 am the total number of covid19 infections to date stood at  10284 according to the korea centers for disease control and  prevention

this is the first time since feb 20 that the number of new infections reported in a single day has fallen below 50

three more people lost their lives to the disease pushing the number of deaths to 186 according to the kcdc 

of  the new patients 20 came from the capital area  11 in seoul due to  overseas travel and eight in gyeonggi province stemming from a cluster  at uijeongbu st marys hospital 

prime minister chung syekyun  urged the public to continue with highlevel physical distancing saying  the country could see an explosion of cases at any time as some  western countries are seeing now 

it was inevitable for us to  extend highlevel social distancing because it was clear that the virus  will spread further if we let our guard down chung said during a  meeting on covid19 in seoul 

i do not want to imagine this  but if the virus spreads to a large number of people in the capital  region we could face the situation that many countries in the west are  experiencing

korea has extended its social distancing campaign  until april 19 closing schools and gyms among other frequently used  facilities in hopes of cutting in half the average number of new  infections per day to 50 or fewer

despite warnings from health  experts highlighting the importance of staying home crowds were seen  outdoors over the weekend as the weather warmed up and flowers  blossomed spurring health concerns

according to the central  disaster and safety countermeasures headquarters last weekend peoples  overall movements were roughly 20 percent more active than in late  february when the number of covid19 patients in the local epicenter   daegu and the surrounding regions  was skyrocketing

health authorities advise people to keep at least 2 meters away from each other as part of social distancing 

chung  referred to physical distancing as the most effective preventative  measure saying it not only protects the person but also shows  consideration for others 

although the average mortality rate  here for covid19 stands at 18 percent the figure jumps to 75 percent  for patients in their 70s and nearly 20 percent among those in their  80s

a total of 135 people were discharged from isolation after  making a full recovery putting the number of recoveries at 6598  according to the kcdc

the number of covid19 patients currently under treatment declined by 91 people to 3500 the agency added

gyeonggi,traveling to south korea in a couple weeks jan 2  10 around seoul suggestions,"i have been reading through and trying to find other relevant links but was wondering if anyone could suggest specifics since it will be colder out i fly in on christmas and then head to el nido palawan for a week over the new years once i am back i will have about 4 or 5 days to myself where my friend will be back at work she is located in anyang so i intended on a 13 days in seoul but ideally would like to venture out on a few solo trips elsewhere i know there probably isnt too much to do outside since it is winter but i am up for just about anything i figured i would stay in gyeonggi providence since i will traveling back to anyang each night

notes about me i am not really interested in going to museums i do like them so if there are some that are suggested id consider its just not something i ideally like to do in a new city or going to all the have tos my favorite way to take is new cities is kind of the anthony bourdain approach which when i say i dont mean entirely revolved around food i mean in a way of immersing in the environment around and not looking so much like a tourist that being said this is my first trip abroad so i dont really know what to expect or know how my comfort level will be when doing this alone but i am ready to push myself would suwon be worthwhile to go to or any of the other surrounding cities

are there any festivals that would be noteworthy of going to areas in seoul that were particularly enjoyed i dont like to plan too much for it makes me tense but i figured i would plan for certain areas of the city and just walk around and see what i find whether its some street food a quaint cafetea house or a restaurant that catches my eye

i live in seattle and a lot of what i listed is what i do here coffeetea out to eat like any city naturally so i dont want to entirely be caught up in my daytoday norm and would like to try and do maybe what is norm for someone living in korea 

either way i know i have read a few peoples comments who have lived here and gave suggestions so anything would be helpful 

thank you for taking the time and reading

gyeonggi,gunpla shopping guide in seoul korea updated april 2019,"gunpla shopping guide in seoul korea updated april 2019

whats changed

april 2019

	added additional stores in seoul and suwon gyeonggi province
	added addresses written in korean  
	added names in korean
	added quick itineraries
	hopefully better readability 
	marked three shops as closed these shops will be removed in the next update

january 2019

	added subway station numbers for easier finding
	added another store

november 2018

	changed the location info of gundam base yongsan
	added an additional shop in a different part of seoul
	some editing for readability purposes
	moved the frequent buyer programs to its own section

im going to model this post after ucantttumpsrumps post on hong kong and put together a guide about gunpla shopping in seoul korea and one in a satellite city this is obviously not a comprehensive list and there are probably better deals elsewhere 

basic information

opening hours unless otherwise specified all stores are open every day at the stated hours 

price all prices will be in korean won krw or just won usd1 is worth roughly krw1100 to krw1150 depending on whats affecting the markets also all prices here already have 10 vat included in them there is no way around this even for foreign tourists for those of you familiar with the japanese yen jpy100 is worth krw1000 to krw1050

the stores listed here generally fall under two categories with the exception of anitong and hobby factory for reasons mentioned further in the guide

1	gundam base
2	third party general hobby shop with a sizable gunpla section

gundam base 

gundam base is a chain of retailers run by bandai korea primarily specializing in gunpla but also stocking a handful of other models made by bandai

all branches have a bunch of different gunpla put together to show shoppers what the final gunpla would look like they arent completely painted and all that  just a straight build and decals 

furthermore gundam base carries some basic tools to get you started on not just building but also some painting and panel lining they carry different cans of finishers gundam markers sandpaper and tools nothing too esoteric but imo just enough to give the curious a taste of what its like to paint or panel line without having to invest heavily from the getgo 

however the gundam base chain is on the more expensive side of the lot  only toys r us and the korean equivalent of  target namely emart home plus and lotte mart charge more but their selections are on the small side to begin with anyway and i wont cover them gb calculates the korean retail price by taking the japanese retail price and multiplying it by 12 but in comparison thirdparty retailers multiply the japanese prices by 10 instead using the mg zz gundam ver ka as an example it costs 72000 won at gb but hobby factory mentioned down below has it for around 54000 won using pg strike rouge  skygrasper package gb has it for 228000 won while hf has it for 171000 won

that said gundam base is home to limited editions exclusive to gb like the mg rx782 30 clear color the boxes for these models have a unique white border like thishttpkradmingundaminfouploadeditor20170818180035pvqyqexhjpg that along with the general convenience of the locations may make gundam base a onestop shop worth the price hike but thats relative

thirdparty hobby shops 

the next group is pretty selfexplanatory you have gunpla as well as other model kits like reallife military hardware and vessels and a pretty comprehensive amount of tools and paint gunpla prices here are slightly cheaper than gundam base whereas gundam base takes the japanese retail price and multiplies it by 12 these stores as well as other thirdparty retailers take the japanese retail price and multiply it by 10 depending on the store gunpla takes up anywhere between 15 to 14 of the total store space 

i will list stores sorted by seoul subway stops  if you ever visit seoul for whatever reason the subway will be your best friend 

yongsan   line 1 135 gyeonghuijungang line k110

this is the electronics district of seoul everything from laptops to appliances and video games can be found here but unless you live in a country with 220v you wont be interested furthermore computer prices are higher than the likes of newegg 

gundam base    website httpbandaimallcokrgundambaseindexdo

opening hours 1030am to 830pm 9pm on weekends

location ipark mall living park section 6th floor its connected to the subway station so you dont have to walk outdoors 

address korean   21 17   6

one of the bigger branches in seoul there is also a tamiya store nearby where you can pick up tools or tamiya kits

asem hobby   httpthehobbyshopcokrmaindefaultasp

opening hours 1000am to 700pm

location etland 4th floor

korean address    74   4

get out through exit 3 and hang a left keep walking while keeping the novotel ambassador on your left youll come to an intersection and etland will be right in front of you

asem hobby is more of a general hobby modeling shop rather than a gunplaspecific one this also means that their general tool lineup is far more comprehensive than that of gundam base so if you would like to pick up some nippers or other things that you can still carry back home it may be worth a visit 

i noticed that this shop is filled with tools branded style x and it turns out that style x is a brand created by this hobby store i cannot comment on the quality because my current tools work well enough but heres the website if youre interested httpmenstylexcokr

hongik university line 2 239 gyeonguijungang line k314 airport express line a03

as the subway stop name shows this is a college neighborhood with the eponymous university located here lots of eateries cheaper clothes shops and whatnot 

this area is home to more than one gunpla store but theyre a bit scattered around

gundam base hongdae     

opening hours 1100am to 900pm

location near hongik university the easiest way to get there is to get out exit 9 enter the alleyway next to kfc and keep walking straight without making any turns unless the alleyway turns 

korean address   23 8 3

another one of the bigger branches the prices are exactly the same as the yongsan branch and they also have the same gbexclusive kits

there is also a one piecethemed cafe and merchandise store next to it 

hobby factory   httpwwwhobbyfactorykr

opening hours 1200pm to 900pm

location get out of exit 9 and start walking its right next to a hotel called the marigold hotel 

alternatively you can get here from hapjeong station by getting out from exit 3 and walking up 

korean address    108  b1 b2

this store is probably seouls biggest thirdparty gunpla store it is made up of three floors going down with a small first floor as the cashier and area for miniatures and some tools followed by a much larger basement filled with gunpla of all grades and then followed by a smaller basement level for those larger character figurines one interesting thing about this store is that you need to check your bags with the staff  apparently the store experienced numerous thefts so if youre going into the basement you need to drop your bags off these guys also determine prices by multiplying the japanese retail price with 10

joyhobby closed

hapjeong line 2 238 line 6 622

a newly gentrified area of seoul this area is home to some uniquely themed cafes and some of them also have unique menus

gundam shop   closed

sindorim line 1 140 line 2 234

there isnt much to say about this area theres a nice malland an electronics mall called techno mart that has this areas gunpla storeand thats about it the station is a madhouse during rush hour because if you keep going westward on line 1 youre going to exit seoul and go to the satellite cities theres a bigger mall one stop away at yeongdeungpo line 1 butthats about it 

joyhobby   

opening hours 1030am to 830pm 9pm on weekends

location techno mart 3f the mall is connected to the subway station  follow the signs pointing towards exit 2 and youll see an underground route 

korean address    97 

think of this place as another version of asem hobby same thing with prices being 10 times that of japanese prices 

however where it lacks in gunpla it makes up in tools and paints you name it they most likely have it  

gangnam line 2 222 shinbundang line d07

this is the same gangnam mentioned in the kpop song gangnam style the area around the station is like most commercial parts of seoul  lots of restaurants and shops

gundam base gangnam   

opening hours 1130am to 930pm

location near exit 2 within the station not outside walk towards exit 2 and look for the rx782 statue right next to the stairs leading out of the station 

korean address    388  2

again same as above  smaller more compact same prices same limited edition kits worth visiting if youre going to gangnam for something else dont come to this area just for gundam

samseong line 2 219  bongeunsa line 9 929

the reason why i mention two stations is because theres a shopping mall  starfield coex  located between these two stations this area is one of the richer parts of seoul and there are many company buildings as well

there is one shop in the same mall and the mall address is    513  

gundam base   

opening hours 1000am to 1000pm

location coex mall b2 floor there are touchscreen info booths throughout the mall that will help you find your way around

again same as above  smaller more compact same prices probably one of the smallest ones this branch has a noticeably smaller star wars section for sure 

asem hobby   closed

nambu terminal line 3 341

the stop here is named after a bus terminal that happens to be one of the southernmost terminals and the buses here tend to go to smaller regional towns 

at this stop there is a building called the kukje electronic center which has all the stores relevant to this guide and conveniently enough they are all on the 9th floor as the name implies this is a shopping mall that is primarily filled with appliances and gadgets and the 9th floor is dedicated to video games figurines and other plastic crack 

korean address    304 

opening hours 10am to 8pm closed every 1st and 3rd sundays of the month individual stalls can also have their own hours i visited on a tuesday at 11am and noticed a few shops werent open yet 

hobby park   httpwwwhobbyparkcokrncv5mmainindexhtml

opening hours same as the mall

a general hobby model shop with a nice mix of gunpla and nongunpla and a ton of tools and paint gunpla prices are also 10 times the japanese retail price 

no idea what this shop is called 

opening hours same as the mall

filled to the brim with all manners of gunpla and nongundam plastic models it is a small store with boxes stacked on boxes if theres something that catches your eye make sure you ask the owner to take it out for you 

pbandai and limited edition kits are clearly marked up in some cases up to twice as much as retail i found a hguc rx782 real type ver its yen tag says 1200 but the seller asked 25000 krw for it the selection is totally random and the owner does not maintain a separate inventory list 

on the other hand this store seems to carry a bunch of somewhat older kits that gb doesnt carry retail kits go for 10 times the stated yen price 

silim line 2 230

this is a college townlike neighborhood with the korean equivalent of dive bars chicken places shops and all that 

anitong   httpwwwanitongcokr

opening hours 11am9pm

location sammo tower b1 get out of the station via exit 3 and keep walking down the street in the same direction make a right turn on the second street you come across and keep going until you see a bridge across a stream on your right is the building and its conveniently written in english the entrance to the store is indicated with the logo right outside next to the cu convenience store check the website for the logo 

korean address    35  b1

anitong bills itself as koreas largest hobby store with some 30000 plastic models figurines manga light novels and other anime merchandise their words not mine and after visiting it once i think they live up to the name there are gunpla other plastic models even 1100 hasegawa virtual on force models as of this post tools manga books and more 

on an aside they have a tv that plays opening scenes of different anime 

more relevant to this guide gunpla makes up about 12 to 13 of the store there are also paints and tools for sale though i think their selection is smaller than joyhobbys 

prices here may be the cheapest you can get offline on a regular basis random sales notwithstanding the prices for gunpla here are set at 9 times the japanese retail price so using the zz ver ka again the japanese retail price is 6000 yen most of the thirdparty retailers mentioned here sell it for 60000 won if there is stock anitong sells it at 54000 won 

that said i noticed they have more hg and sd kits on display compared to the other grades it seems like at gundam base the space is divided mostly equally for each grade probably with the exception for pg and whatever extras they have are kept in storage but at anitong i saw columns and columns of sd and hg kits with lesser numbers of mg kits  

furthermore anitong holds random sales for their lineup slashing prices by upwards of 20 at times however some of these sales are available only to members of their frequent buyer program 

heres another store that also sells a handful of pbandai kits at higher prices just a couple cabinets worth though so dont make this store your goto for limited kits 

euljiro 1ga line 2 202

welcome to myeongdong a large shopping district with goods of all price ranges from street stalls selling cheap trinkets to the likes of uniqlo and hm to midrange goods like nike to highend luxury goods there is a gundam base in this neighborhood within the lotte department store or more precisely lotte young plaza as listed below 

gundam base   

opening hours 1130am930pm identical to mall hours closed every second or third monday of the month  there doesnt seem to be a specific pattern

korean address    67 1 

location lotte young plaza b1 after you get off the subway and pass the turnstile head over to exits 7 and 8 you can get to gb a couple of ways get out via exit 7 walk down the street with the road on your left until you see lotte young plaza on the right enter and look for an escalator going downor you can navigate the shopping mall to get to gb 

this is the least confusing and most straightforward as the store layout isnt exactly the easiest to understand that said if the weather isnt great there are staff members here who are likely to understand english or mandarin chinese so they may be able to help you navigate your way 

this is just like any other gundam base mentioned so far there is one difference though in that besides the gbexclusive kits they also have a few limited item and expo kits on sale at their original prices

suwon line 1 p155 bundang line k245

this section is made possible with the help of ucmndjernavy who visited korea for a while and stayed relatively near this branch thanks a lot man

suwon is a satellite city located about an hour or two southwest of seoul there are about a couple of historical sites in the area as well as one gundam base 

gundam base   

opening hours 1030am to 1000pm

location ak plaza 5f this is a department store chain like lotte mentioned above and this too is conveniently connected directly to the station 

korean address    1 924 ak 5

same as all other branches possibly on the slightly bigger side there is also a tamiya store nearby 

 quick itineraries 

given how the stores are not exactly clumped in one part of seoul and i very much doubt gunpla enthusiasts would visit korea for gunpla when japan is right there here are a couple of quick itineraries that will minimize travel give you as much gunpla as possible and hopefully keep your shopping to one afternoon unless youre looking for a specific kit

	southeast seoul gangnam area gundam base gangnam and the two stores at kukje electronic center
	northwestcentral seoul hongik university area gundam base and hobby factory 

 for expat hobbyists 

i have clumped additional frequent buyer and pbandai info here because the only way for anyone to take advantage of this is to have a korean cellphone number not to mention some degree of korean fluency  these are needed to register yourself online for the buyer program this might make it difficult for shortterm tourists and other visitors to take advantage of so i figure longerterm residents  usfk united states forces korea students employees spouses basically anyone staying for at least one year  would be more interested in this section

frequent buyer  cashback programs 

just about every store mentioned here and countless more online have some kind of cashback or mileage program where a certain percentage of your total purchase is saved and then can be used as store credit to fund your next purchase in terms of percentage gundam base anitong and hobby factory have the largest percentage figure at 5 though if you order gunpla from bandais online mall that jumps to 10 joyhobbys and asem hobbys are the lowest at 1 with the exception of anitong the store credit does have an expiration date of 1 year from the date of purchase which means that if you bought something in june july and august the points you got from your june purchase will expire next june while the remainder will expire in the following months afterwards 

gundam base exclusive perks 

besides the store credit program gundam basebandai namco has a member ranking and stamp card system card image here httpkradmingundaminfouploadeditorvbslslidbgmazeknsgltjpg   the image is outdated because theres no stamp section for misc 1100 when you buy a gunpla you get a physical card on which the employee adds stamps equivalent to the number of kits you bought according to grade these stamps do not expire but if you lose the card youre out of luck 

gundam base also does doublestamp deals in two cases holidays namely seol  lunar new year which falls around january or february chuseok  autumn harvest which falls around september christmas summer and winter school vacations and the first weekend following the release of a new kit just for those kits 

when you fill up the hg rg misc 1100 and mg stamp cards halfway you get the following no midway bonuses for sd and pg

	hg single gundam marker
	rg action base 2 black
	1100 and mg action base 1 black

when you fill one grades card up completely you get to trade the card for a kit of your choice of that grade up to a certain value filling the pg card will let you get any gunpla of any grade up to a certain price 

now how is that value determined this is where the ranking system comes into play depending on how much money you spend at gundam base offline or online for one year as of this guides publication between 212019 and 1312020 youre ranked from top to bottom diamond gold silver bronze or ng pun intended their servers compile your total purchases and rank you and the rank is good for the next year from 212020 the minimum expenditures are as follows

	ng less than krw200000
	bronze krw200000
	silver krw800000
	gold krw1600000
	diamond krw3000000

the card can be redeemed by any registered member of gundam base the maximum retail price limits at each rank are as follows

sdhgrgmisc 1100mgpg
ng bronze silverkrw 11000krw 30000krw 40000krw 40000krw 80000krw 100000
goldkrw 12100krw 33000krw 44000krw 44000krw 88000krw 110000
diamondkrw 13600krw 36000krw 48000krw 48000krw 96000krw 120000

note a full pg stamp card allows you to get any gunpla kit of any grade as long as the price ceiling is maintained this is probably because the only pg kit you can get within the price limit at any rank is the pg skygrasper krw 60000 

at each of these ranks you get different perks mostly discount coupons useable online or offline though there are some coupons for exclusively online use 

anitong exclusive perks

as mentioned above anitongs store credit program is on the more generous end with 5 of your total purchases being saved as credit another point for anitong is that the credit does not expire 

furthermore anitong provides a modest 1000 won discount coupon for every 20000 won spent in cash or 40000 won spent with a credit card 

there are also random memberexclusive sales where upwards of 30 is shaved off their prices of certain kits 

 pbandai in korea

bandai korea offers pbandai kits under a moniker called clubg preorders start usually a week or two after japanese preorders begin but unlike regions where pbandai has a presence as pbandai bandai korea gets a certain number of kits set aside for the korean market so popular kits get sold out extremely quickly on the first run once you make an order and pay for it the kits are delivered about 34 months later these kits are not eligible for discounts but you still get the cashback benefits 

besides clubg there are the one unnamed shop and anitong i mentioned above with elevated prices as well as gundam base in euljiro1ga as i mentioned the selection is totally random

so thats more or less my updated shopping guide for seoul korea let me know if you have questions or things to point out"

gyeonggi,event new visa and foreign worker laws,"the number of immigrants in korea has been exploding over the last few years and is now at around 42 million most of them young and working who can balance out the aging korean population the nationalities of immigrants has changed somewhat and those accepted in 2019 are as follows



country of origin  propotion

china  301
thailand  123
philippines  116
vietnam  86
usa  51
indonesia  46
turkey  26
iran  25
bangladesh  23
japan  21
yemen  19

egypt  15
pakistan  05

the domination of chinese immigration is decreasing with more coming in from south east asia south asia and even a noticeable amount from the middle east the thai filipino vietnamese and indonesian population have set up primarily in the siheung ansan and namdong suburbs of seoul siheung is now just over 50 foreignborn making it the first city in korea to have a majority foreign populationthe area to the south west of seoul is home to a vibrant multicultural food scene and is a favourite destination for seoulites



ulsan also has a significant immigrant population with many working manual jobs in the factories as does chungcheong middle eastern labourers  are more common in the south of the country with a around the country foreigners are employed to work low paid construction jobs the vast majority are in seoul gyeonggi or incheon 

the only sources of tension have been in highly conservative daegu home of the dokdo party in a high profile incident nationalist thugs broke into a lebanese takeaway and beat to death the 3 employees and 5 customers 6 of them lebanese and 2 korean this received nationwide media coverage and the 4 criminals have been put on death row with many campaigning for an end to the de facto abolition of capital punishment an antiimmigrant protest nearly turned into a riot and water cannons had to be used to disperse the rabble

we are now less of a homogeneous society immigrants are not exclusively clustered in their own quarters of cities an increasing number are integrating fully and accepted as equally important citizens people of nonkorean races are seen almost regularly on the television and in the news and there are several popular filipino internet personalities these new laws will reflect the changes in korea

 the e9 low skilled foreign worker visa currently allows foreigners to work for up to 4 years and 10 months in manufacturing agricultural construction and some services jobs resettlement of dependents is not legally permitted and this is a temporary visa many on these visas stay illegally and continue to work this will no longer be illegal but encouraged if after the 4 years and 10 months the worker can pass a test on korean culture and history and demonstrates basic korean language skills they may bring their immediate family over and stay here permanently
 we will be introducing a new f7 visa ethnic koreans from anywhere in the world who prove their lineage from a korean citizen within 3 generations will be able to travel live study and work freely in korea for up to 5 years and must only reside here for 3 before naturalisation
 young people in their final year of education on the d2 student visa may apply for a job seeking visa which they can live on for 6 months if they find a professional job in this time then they may naturalise after 6 months of work
 we will introduce a new test which foreigners can take before applying for their visa the visa applicant skill assessment this will test their mathematical scientific and logical skills to see if they are particularly intellectually gifted those who score very highly may apply for a special d2 student visa which offers discounted education for the disadvantaged or for a visa which will allow them to live in korea for up to a year while they search for work when they can get an employment visa
 foreign workers will receive the same legal working rights as natural born koreans the new foreign labor commission will ensure that these standards are being met and that foreigners are not mistreated with anonymous internet and telephone reporting systems and occasional random checks of employers with many reports
 the foreign labor commission will set up a database of foreign workers with their qualifications skills and legal status which companies can search to quickly find suitable employees
 antihate crime laws have been introduced to combat the racist abuse suffered by many workers verbal racial abuse will be punished by a fine of 1500 if crimes including assault criminal damage harassment murder sexual assault and burglary are shown to have been committed for racial reasons sentencing will be harsher
 the employment permit system which requires foreigners to gain permission from employers before changing jobs leads to exploitation and will be scrapped instead they will only have to prove that they have received a job offer from another company to change jobs"
gyeonggi,lcl open cup preseason tournament for lcl teams  best pub teams announcement,"full announcement in russianhttprulolesportscomarticles493

english translation

waiting for the start of the lcl we have great news pro teams return from their vacations a bit early to compete in the offseason lcl open cup

the lcl open cup is designed to pit pro teams against each other as well as against best pub teams of the ru server determined through open qualifiers the tournament will feature two lan group stages in moscow november 20th and stpetersburg november 25th27th each group will feature three lcl teams and one open qualifier winner only one team per group will advance to the semifinals where worlds quarterfinalists albus nox luna and iem gyeonggi participants vega squadron await the prize pool is 1500000 rubles roughly 25000 to be distributed among the top four details about the groups will be available later

then its the info about open qualifiers and where to sign up largely irrelevant to anyone not on the ru server

from the op i dont have any inside info obviously but this is probably the dress rehearsal of lcl going to the lan format fulltime they did group stages online last year maybe even as a traveling circus type of thing great idea overall though gives lcl teams other than vega and anx something to do in the offseason

the country

the republic of korea also known as south korea is home to over 50 million people over half live in the capital seoul making it the fifthlargest metropolis in the world what some may not know is that korea has over 3300 islands and 70 of the country is considered mountainous

korea is famous worldwide for its technological exports with tech companies such as samsung and lg the hallyu wave has made tv shows and films like the masked singer which the us ruined squid games descendants of the sun running man and train to busan gain audiences around the globe and the success of kpop stars like bts blackpink twice red velvet exo psy snsd super junior and more all contributing to the 14thhighest gdp in the world

sporting pedigree

korean football teams are everpresent in the afc champions league and the domestic kleague is competed by 12 teams and has seen 9 different winners since its inception in 1983 koreas bestknown footballers are son heungmin and manchester united champions league winner park jisung with other icons such as ahn junghwan fired by perugia after scoring against italy in 2002 and bundesliga legend cha bumkun aka cha boom for his rocket shots  

as a baseball powerhouse many korean players have played at the highest level in americas mlb including ryu hyunjin choo shinsoo and jiman choi korea is widely known for its pioneering and domination of the esports scene as well

other sports korean athletes have excelled in especially at the olympics are archery shooting and taekwondo korea is also the asian country with the most medals in the winter olympics

world cup history

korea is the most successful asian football team in history having participated in ten consecutive and eleven overall fifa world cup tournaments the most by any asian country yet of the 22 nations to have played 30 or more matches at the world cup korea has the lowest win ratio having won just six of their 34 games their highest finish was 4th place in their home 2002 world cup cohosted with japan defeating the likes of italy portugal and spain with guus hiddink at the helm

outside of the world cup korea has won the afc asian cup twice the east asian football federation championship five times and taken home three gold medals in the asian games other notable results include olympic bronze in 2012 beating archrivals japan for the medal and also knocking out hosts great britain in the quarterfinal and a fourthplace finish at the 2002 concacaf gold cup beating mexico along the way in a penalty shootout

road to qatar

the road to qatar began september 10 2019 with a 20 victory over turkmenistan with korea going on to finish top of their secondround group scoring 22 goals and conceding just once

advancing to the third round in the afc korea finished runnersup in the group 2 points behind iran scoring 13 goals and conceding 3

in 2022 korea faces uruguay in a round of 16 rematch from 2010 which korea lost then ghana before finishing up with a match as if it was fate paulo bentos old team portugal korea will be looking to improve on 2018s groupstage exit the only highlight being the 20 miracle of kazan win over germany in the final game after losing to sweden and mexico 

perhaps the most telling effect of the desire to start fresh 18 players from the 26man squad will be going to their firstever world cup the average age of the side is 27 years old



the squad

forwards son heungmin tottenham hwang uijo olympiakos cho guesung jeonbuk hyundai motors

three players not named son heungmin or kim minjae to watch

lee kangin

the 2019 asian young footballer of the year is also the youngest south korean player in the history of the uefa champions league making his debut for valencia against chelsea at just 18 years of age 

unlike a few members of this korean team kangin is having a good season he was nominated la liga player of the month in august having moved to mallorca from valencia and scored against his old team when they played a few weeks ago 

he has played predominantly in the center as either a second striker or an attacking midfielder for korea and in addition to this has also played on the wings for mallorca kangin is the essential utility player every squad needs in a tournament this role has been magnified with the injury to son and the worrying lack of form among the other established forward players 

bento however said his selection of lee kangin was not intended to cover for son should the korean talisman be unable to play

kangin was in the squad for the friendlies against costa rica and cameroon but did not play kangin has so much talent but bentos stubbornness to stick to personal favorites means he has often not been allowed to impress which has frustrated many fans who can see he has huge potential

i always believed that as long as i played well in la liga and proved i could be an asset to the national team he bento would pick me kangin said in september i will try to prove to the coaching staff and my teammates that i can contribute a great deal to the team if i can do that i believe i will go to the world cup

hopefully kangin will be a player to watch on the field and not just warming the bench again hes still only 21  the youngest in the squad  and has a huge future ahead of him 

if qatar isnt the tournament in which he gets to show it uscanadamexico will be his stage for sure

jung wooyoung

he has been a regular fixture in the national team since making his senior debut in 2015 amassing over 60 caps and is an essential piece in bentos tactical style the 2012 olympic bronzewinning midfielder will sit in front of the back four and look to break up the oppositions play and can also slot in as an extra central defender if required not one to watch for fans of fancy football

with kim minjae behind him who is very adept at carrying the ball forward wooyoung may be seen covering for the inform napoli man should he take the ball out from the back as bento likes this korean team to do 

he walked off the pitch with an apparent leg injury late on in the recent iceland game but should be fine injuries have been an issue as of late unfortunately and this is expected to be his final world cup

i had some trouble ramping back up after getting injured jung has said of his left ankle and calf injuries from june ive been trying to get back to good form and ive not wasted a single day my goal is to be even better than my peak from the past and i think i am on the right path

wooyoung has played in qatar since joining xavis old team al sadd playing alongside the legendary spaniard and subsequently playing under him when he became manager korea will hope this opportunity to learn from one of the sports alltime greats will pay off in such a tricky group where koreas midfield really could be the key to unlocking the attacking potential held by the fastpaced forward players 

lee jaesung

another experienced member of the side over the years with over 60 caps to his name lee has scored twice this season for mainz in the bundesliga and has been a fairly regular fixture in the starting eleven he missed out on koreas summer friendlies through injury but is back and will look to make an impact whether as a winger or an attackminded central midfielder depending on how bento changes styles should complement hwang inbeom well 

no matter where he plays he can use his speed and stamina well his goal against werder bremen earlier this season saw him make a storming run from central midfield and left completely unchecked by the defense leaving him free to pick the ball up from a pass outside the penalty area and slot it past with ease albeit with a little help from a deflection also in his arsenal is his calmness under pressure and ability to use both feet breaking out a few stepovers or a cryuffturn to get himself out of trouble a fun one to watch

korea has made the most out of highintensity highstamina players before most famously the legendary park jisung with the likelihood most of their games will be spent chasing possession and waiting for an opportunity to break out lee jaesung is the perfect player for such a role as hes happy to go get the ball himself and run with it as far as he needs to before putting in a through ball to an overlapping player or going for goal himself 

honorable mentions

jeong wooyeong spent time in the bayern munich youth setup now 23 and at freiburg where the winger has 10 goals to his name and plenty of speed to burn maybe another who gets their shot during the next cycle though

hwang inbeom versatile central midfielder has been everpresent for olympiakos this season and is a trusted lieutenant for paulo bento having moved to the greek side after consulting with the former olympiakos boss

cho yumin if youre watching him something has gone wrong a lastminute inclusion due to injuries yumin plays for daejeon hana citizen they are in the korean second tier though they did win the league and are being promoted to the first tier he is the only member of the squad to play in the korean second tier 



points of discussion

the tactics  bento ball

exbenfica and sporting manager paulo bento was appointed to lead the korean team in 2018 following their disappointing world cup campaign with a contract running through the end of the 2022 world cup he has become the longestserving head coach in the national teams history but has also proved to be one of the most controversial

bento has been criticized for his conservative tactics his reluctance to be flexible in tactical styles and player selection and his inability to play his players in their best positions all familiar stories i am sure for portugal fans during his 4 years in charge of the seleo das quinas

under bentos management korea has been focused on playing it out from the back preferring a 4132 or a 4231 formation he recently experimented with a 4141 with mixedtopoor results in the friendlies against brazil chile and paraguay and the eaff tournament against hong kong and japan

in the 10 win over iceland on november 11 bento went with a back three for the first time since september 2019

regardless of the chosen tactic the playstyle largely remained the same keeping possession in the midfield and using sweepers to get the ball moving forward often worked against more inferior teams during south koreas world cup qualifiers but against koreas world cup group stage opponents portugal uruguay and ghana the strategy may not be so effective bento has been heavily criticized for not having a plan b 

in my opinion it doesnt make sense to change our style its much worse in my opinion for us to play differently in a way that were not used to because if we dont have time to correct certain things its almost impossible to make too much of a difference  paulo bento

in the disappointing 00 draw with iraq during qualifying forward players were often isolated when the midfield got pressed and manmarked bento then insisted on repeating the same patterns of attack relying heavily on wingbacks to try and spread the play to the lesscrowded areas of the pitch but iraq did not take long to figure out the game plan and block them

against highpressing teams korea has often been outplayed and overwhelmed notably in the 51 friendly loss to brazil who dominated the press marked son out of the game and kept korea off the ball to claim almost 60 total possession the chastening 30 friendly loss to japan last year almost cost bento his job as japan pressed korea out of the game korea was unable to create passing lanes forward and the lone striker in the 4141 was isolated and ineffectual 

i admit that things didnt work out the way we intended them to in the first half we only ended up passing the ball around the middle of the field we only got a little better at it in the second half  paulo bento after the defeat to japan

when it works it works well and korea has plenty of versatile attacking options but the worry is that teams can figure out their gameplan quickly and bento isnt good enough  or even willing  to find a fix this leads us to the next talking point

the players  versatile unbalanced and out of form

before the qatar world cup there is a long way to go and there are too many homework assignments to solve the two puzzles of players and tactics when someone has a problem i dont see a player who can fill it  park moonsung commentator

its no secret that last seasons premier league golden boot winner son is the star of this team to call korea a oneman team is unfair but it does merit some discussion 

earlier this year bento was forced to take a squad of only domesticbased players to the east asian football federation championship the tournament fell outside the official fifa calendar so many clubs did not release their star players leaving the likes of son and kim minjae unavailable korea met expectations by dispatching hong kong and china 30 each but then in their final game against japan fell 30 themselves and recorded a dismal one shot on target

the tournament was meant to be an audition for those domestic league players looking to stake their claim for a spot on the final world cup roster which would need this domestic depth to complement the core overseas players the final squad has 12 players who are signed to clubs outside of korea including two in the bundesliga and three in the premier league

but the loss to japan exposed south koreas worrisome lack of depth and together with the mixed friendly results particularly the 10 win over iceland with a koreanbased team only shows that many korean players may have a lack of experience against top opposition both domestically and internationally

making things worse is that this overseas core has been struggling this season hwang heechan has not been struggling at wolves and hwang uijo has been making cameo appearances on loan for olympiakos since making the move from bordeaux to nottingham forest if goals are to be scored these players need to leave their club form behind and switch up the gears for their country especially now because the one man expected to lead this time by himself if needed is now a doubt  and who admittedly has not been having a great domestic season himself even before the injury

in koreas favor is that kim minjae is having an outstanding season for napoli and there is plenty of young attacking talent ready to show up and show off if given the chance the worry is though like many teams that if the core isnt performing or has an injury problem can the backups really be counted on when it matters

the injury  risk and reward

the unthinkable happened son was injured playing for spurs against marseille just weeks before the world cup sustaining a fractured eye socket which required surgery this injury has thrown a huge wrench in koreas world cup preparations so close to the tournament 

weve been informed by tottenham that son heungmin had completed a successful procedure but since the surgery just took place its too early at this point to discuss his status for the world cup the national teams medical staff has remained in contact with tottenham regarding sons injury  statement from the korean football association

son is a warrior having played with a fractured arm before it didnt seem to have a big impact on his form however this injury is very different of course

being an aerial threat and scoring headers has never really been a focal part of his game his pace and technical skills on his feet have always been his strongest points and this injury is unlikely to stop him from being able to replicate this kind of play

players going to a major tournament while injured is nothing new wayne rooney was in the england squad for the 2006 world cup despite his broken metatarsal he returned to action within six weeks of suffering the injury only missing out on englands opening game 

others have played through facial injuries before notably kevin de bruyne he fractured his eye socket in the 2021 champions league final but within three weeks he was masked up and playing for belgium at the euros

the question is then how much of a role on the field can he play

he might sit out the opener or at least come off the bench to get a feel for things if hes able no doubt hes raring to go he needs just one goal to surpass the record of koreas alltime top scorer at world cups ahn junghwan and park jisung are currently tied with him as the recordholders with 3 goals 

should son not be able to play its still a great benefit to bring him along as part of the squad he embodies korean football and can be an inspiring presence in the dressing room just as much as he could be out on the field

we are in contact with him with the tottenham medical department but about the exact time the exact day he can train with the team we dont have that information yet  bento

suwon samsung bluewings forward oh hyeongyu is also travelling with the team to qatar as a reserve player as cover for son 

he may get his chance  even if not for son hwang heechan missed the first training session at the time of writing with what team officials have described as left hamstring discomfort fullback kim jinsu has also been battling a hamstring problem he didnt take part in any team sessions only doing individual workouts 

expectation

south koreas first group h match against uruguay is on november 24th the taegeuk warriors will then face ghana on november 28th and portugal on december 2nd all three matches will be played at the education city stadium in al rayyan west of doha

hopefully son is able to take part despite his injury an expectation shared by the players would be korea progressing to the round of 16

we want to take this one match at a time and reach the round of 16 i am sure everyone on the team understands what we should do to get to that point  kim younggwon

but the numbers dont lie with opta crunching the numbers and giving korea an 82 chance to make the last 16

that lack of faith isnt shared by the players or fans who will cheer on this group no matter what

plus with so much young talent coming through  theres always next time right

gangwon,241009 throwback 8 years ago arirang medley  bts version was released on arirang the cd for hangeul day ,"first a bit of background the kcon 2016 event was scheduled to be held on june 2 in paris france the first time in europe now this event was more than a regular kcon it was set to commemorate the 130th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between korea and france with south korean president park geunhye and other dignitaries in attendance

bts had started their the most beautiful moment in life on stage epilogue tour and they took a break to travel to france to participate while they were there bts performed   arirang medley with artists block b shinee ftisland fx and ioi as the opening performancehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvwc5ztayvjw

just like this kcon was not a typical event this song choice was not just any song this medley was made to celebrate the korean folk song arirang considered by many to be koreas unofficial national anthem this special song is part of the unesco intangible cultural heritage of humanity and this version was made with the support of the korean ministry of culture sports and tourism to make this song bts reinterpreted the gyeongi seoul arirang for the beginning melody the jeongseon arirang jindo arirang and millyang arirang versions for the central verses and followed those up with the last verse with lyrics they wrote themselves incorporating phrases from gangwon arirang they sang it in dialect satoori

now for todays event at some point bts made a studio recording of their version of the song a promotional cdhttpstwittercomladynualastatus1668670019633393667 simply titled arirang included this song as track 3 and it was distributed for free at the national museum of korea on october 9 2016 which was hangeul nal or hangeul day korean alphabet day

many view this song as simply a cover but as they have done a number of times bts took this song and fashioned a version of it that is all their own and once again they invited all of us to appreciate something beautiful from their culture not sure if there are copyright issues but maybe someday it will be available for streaming hope everyone has a lovely hangeul day today"

gangwon,angry soccer fans call for firing worldclass con man jrgen klinsmann and kfa head and jaebol boss chung mongkyu they later modify demands to call for klinsmanns deportation and ask song heungmins father to take over the national team,"hecklers and protestors were gathered earlier today to call for the firing of south koreas national soccer coach jrgen klinsmann and the head of the korean football association chung mongkyu  later they changed their demands and called for klinsmanns deportation  we dont want him to set his foot on the korean soil again  the only problem however is that klinsmann is already back in his adopted home country  in newport beach in the california republik  what they probably mean is that they want klinsmann to be declared a persona non grata  this is the step south korea takes to its own citizens that are draft dodgers and went overseas to evade its armed service requirement

earlier klinsmann took part in a zoom conference call across the pacific where he learned of the recommendation that he be fired  the recommendation was made by a kfa committee dedicated to the technical and strategic review of the national team  but this is a recommendation only and has no teeth for enforcement  the final decision is in the hands of chung mongkyu  the kfa head that hails from the zillionaire hyundai jaebol family  chung is the former ceo of hyundai motors and currently heads hdc the construction arm of hyundai that builds highrise residential towers  plus he owns two kleague franchises and heads some halfdozen other positions in soccer and athletics  he is the face of korean soccer  it was was indeed chung that personally hired klinsmann  how he did so despite vehement opposition from certain kfa factions analysts and fans is now part of the lore documenting many decades of administrative incompetence of the korean football association

httpspreviewredditalfm1yy5rpic1pngwidth1920formatpngautowebpsf0b13665badc1047ad2803eb0e9df45b4a38b828

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtpp9dji7biehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtpp9dji7bie

i thought at first this particular band of rather aging protestors was engaged in a parody protest  but no they are dead serious  their banner reads

immediately fire worldclass con man and grifter jrgen klinsmann who embarrassed 50million korean people  kfa president chung mongkyu who abused his power to hire this international con man must resign and take full responsibility

the protestor on the left is holding a wooden bar labeled bar of justice  the protestor on the right is holding a deflated soccer ball that symbolizes zerostrategy kicktheballdownthefield playing style  korean fans derisively call this type of playing style kickball soccer  in contrast with the tikitaka style of european soccer that emphasizes accurate passes and lateral movement  during its embarrassing semifinal loss to jordan klinsmanns team struggled to establish any offensive tempo and had zero shots on goal

to understand this and other protests being staged by angry fans you have to be familiar with several recent developments surrounding south koreas national team

 former presidential candidate hong joonpyo now mayor of the city of daegu is calling for klinsmanns ouster httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfgqm4gpk2zmppyguw7zmn7ksa7zgcio2btoumsoykpounqa3d3dhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfgqm4gpk2zmppyguw7zmn7ksa7zgcio2btoumsoykpounqa3d3d  hong became famous in 2018 when he traveled to the us to make a case for south korea to develop nuclear weapons of its own  other politicians are starting to murmur and voice their concerns about the national team  yoon ally and national assemblyman kwon seongdong urged we are done examining coach klinsmanns performance  the football association has to now act  piling on the football team particularly by politicians is a national pastime only 6 weeks away from the national election  elections are typically very close in south korea agitating for the ouster of common villains klinsmann and chung could garner much needed lastminute votes
 it has come to light that two korean soccer stars son heungmin and lee kangin engaged in a fisticuff where son dislocated his finger  this happened the night before the semifinal game  son was seen wearing a sling to keep his finger stationary during the game against jordan  other players confirmed the tiff and some players came out against lee claiming that hes headstrong and doesnt listen to senior players  some soccer fans are now pointing out why former nationalteam coach paulo bento never called up lee during his tenure as he may have noted lees disruptive behavior that went against team unity  fans of son have taken over lees instagram account and are leaving hatefilled comments to lee who has since apologized  but now they started to attack the instagram account of lees older sister who used to post and brag about his kid brothers exploits httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv5ju4zw1ohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv5ju4zw1o
 several investigative pieces have emerged in south korea regarding klinsmanns failed coaching tenures at bayern munich toronto hertha bsc and his 6year tenure coaching the us soccer team  at focus has been his lack of strategic vision and football philosophy as well as his lax work ethic  particularly his penchant for travel to farflung places ostensibly to watch national team players play in foreign leagues  but the guy apparently liked to mix business with pleasure and his claim that hes checking out players rang hollow when he ran several businesses of his own  his business success depended on him being  a soccer celebrity  klinsmann was a cheerleadertouristcoach who liked to be seen celebrating goals but could never hold his own in the rarefied field of tactical and technical soccer  drawing xs and os to illustrate soccer formations was not exactly his forte he was a pom pomwielding cheerleader who never met a camera he didnt like  by the time his us stint was over everyone was made aware of his act except for the korean football association who may not have been sophisticated enough to tell apart a cheerleading celebrity from a technically sound and cerebral coach  httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrfhh7kik6wlistpl05hhnconqb3zpsrh2znppvjer4p2vqindex7httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrfhh7kik6wlistpl05hhnconqb3zpsrh2znppvjer4p2vqindex7

later the hecklers ended their protest by calling for son heungmins father to take over the national team  huh  sons dad is son woongjeong who runs a youth soccer academy in chooncheon in the province of gangwon  earlier he had left an enigmatic comment regarding his sons exploits as the korean team made it to the semifinals at quatar  the korean national team should never win the asian cup  if it does the current woes and decay mismanagement by the korean football association will continue  this earlier comment resonated with the protestors who became enraged upon witnessing kickball soccer being played in the teams onesided loss to jordan

but son sr has no experience coaching at the adult level  it doesnt matter  the sons are a family of saints in south korea  they can do anything"
gangwon,itinerary check,"what do you think of the below its our first time in busan but weve gone to seoul before we always go during winter tho so itll be our first time there in autumn the first half is a little tight because one person in my group will be leaving on the 6th so all the touristy activities are squeezed into the first few days

gangwon,what if ktx runs out of luggage space,"what do i do with my luggage in case of such an unfortunate situation

what other options do i have to ensure that i can carry my 15kg max luggage from one province to the next

i would very much like to go the ktx route to shorten travel time like from seoul to jeonju or from busan to gangwondo but other than those long distance travels im fine with other alternatives

the question stills stands tho what if ktx runs out of luggage space"

 1 about me

 25m from israel philosophy and psychology student work as a linux sysadmin
 have previous travel experience  ive traveled new zealand 4 months australia 1 month japan 10 days and italy and france with six weeks each
 traveled exclusively via public transit
 traveled with carryon baggage only  a simple backpack 30l 67kg and a small camera pouch for my camera passport transport card credit card
 im an active traveler ill usually leave at 79am and return at 20002100pm
 im looking to do my own thing and have not tried to meet up with people though i often did  locals and travelers alike
 i love history philosophy food music art and culture many of the sites ive visited and activities ive done centered around these

 2 goals of my trip

my aim was to experience korea  the history the people the land the life here  in the most authentic and intimate way i never tried to see the most amazing things in the shortest possible time  but to breach to tourist barrier and experience the country i went where koreans went ate what koreans eat did what koreans do

 3 preparations

i bought my ticket 5 months before departure and started to prepare korea is seriously mountainous and english isnt widely spoken see should i learn korean so i

 got in shape running yoga
 learned korean i spent an average of 30 minutes a day  every single day until departure
 ive booked accommodation well in advance  though this was hardly necessary

 4 budgeting

all sums on this post are in korean won krw  
  
planned 134000 a day  
  
spent 95000 a day average  
  
total sum of everythingness 7318500  
  
for a more detailed breakdown on attractions accommodation transport food see respective sections

my budget was for sleeping in higherend hostels eating out once a day with some coffee tea and beersoju and getting around on public transport i was comfortable throughout my trip

daytoday the vast majority of places take foreign credit cards but some dont  in particular markets recharging transport cards and rarely  bus terminals require cash its wise to keep a days budget in cash just in case

 seoul 7 nights 6 days  4 nights

naver listhttpsnavermegrmaxwv5

koreas capital cultural and economical center seoul is a city of contrast  monks take the subway ancient city wall gates stand in massive intersections people loaded with gadgets take pictures of food thats been eaten here for generations its a little bit of everything korea seoul is amazing  i enjoyed every minute here i enjoyed the historical places the most  hiking inwangsan along the old city walls seeing hwaseong fortress the stunning national museum the temples and the palaces i would live here in a heartbeat

 gwanghwamun

 gyeongbukgung palace  seouls premier palace night tours sometimes available massive fairly crowded beautiful do not miss the changing of the guards  its tourist kitsch but really fun
 mmca contemporary art museum contemporary art museum dealing with many of modern koreas issues  the war the dark past the rapid urbanization
 jogyesa temple classic buddhist temple surrounded by skyscrapers the contrast is jarring  absolutely beautiful
 bukchon hanok village
 changdeokgung palace  secret garden pretty but similar to gyeongbukgung imo  pick one or the other this ones far less busy somewhat smaller
 jongmyo confucian shrine the most spectacular part is currently under renovation 
 cheongyecheon stream walkway
 gwangjang market  massive food market with food from all across korea

 myeongdong

 nseoul tower  namsan park  touristy but great views at night
 namdaemun market
 deoksugung palace  small cute palace to see seouls nightscape easily  no tour or reservation required for late entrance
 seoul city hall  it looks like a spaceship that is all

 itaewon

 leeum samsung museum of art an amazing contemporary and traditional art gallery the traditional part is free the rest is well worth it get the audio guide
 war memorial of korea  the korean war step by step i strongly suggest a visit here before seeing the dmz
 national museum of korea amazing allencompassing history museum if youre serious about figuring korea out this should be one of your first sites
 banpo bridge rainbow fountain

 dongdaemun

 dongdaemun design plaza  spectacular light shows at evenings
 seoul city walls museum  about seouls ancient still maintained wall great place to prepare to hike the city wallshttpsseoulcitywallseoulgokrenimagescommonimgmapjpg
 naksan section of the seoul city wall starts at the city wall museum  short 1h great views

 northern seoul

 seodaemun prison history hall  former japanese colonial prison a fascinating dark insight to colonized korea
 inwangsan section of seoul city wall  i woke up hella early and got to the peak on sunrise breathtaking  literally
 bukaksan section of the seoul city wall nice but inferior to inwangsan heavy photography restrictions
 kilsangsa temple

 gangnam

 seoul forest park  great for a weekend stroll cute butterfly garden
 bongeunsa temple  big temple with amazing city views more impressive than jogyesa
 coex mall  i loathe malls not sure why i did this
 yeouido park  nice forest park nestled between massive skyscrapers reaching all the way to the han river very pretty

 suwon seoul day trip

1h from seoul the main draw to suwon is the hwaseong fortress a massive late joseon fortress immaculately preserved smack in the middle of modern suwon this took me half a day at a lazy pace  it was a great day out

 dmz seoul day trip

the stories and sights around the worlds most militarized border are haunting bizarre and a once in a lifetime experience touching on the sheer horror that is north korea

i took a fullday dmz tourhttpswwwgetyourguidecomseoull197fromseoulkoreadmzhalfdaytourt142011 i loved the experience and enjoyed the longer day out  it was a small group with an awesome guide  but if short on time the highlights are definitely in the first half of the day

tip visiting the war memorial of korea beforehand has been a great help in experiencing the dmz

tips

 i think it hardly matters where you stay in seoul so long as you stay near a metro station i stayed in hongdae the first time and in jungno the second  it made absolutely no difference
 seoul is m a s s i v e and distance doesnt always correspond to travel time as the metro is fast and traffic is intense plan your days accordingly
 seoul starts up late and really gets going at night most places are closed as late as 1000 with some trendy areas as far as 1200 lots of stuff happens later at night  festivals lights shows fountains etc
 cross big intersections using the subway stations 

 jeonju 3 nights

naver listhttpsnavermexki6uvsd

famous for its hanok traditional korean house village and home of the bibimbap rice bowl with vegetables and spicy sauce served in a sizzling hot stonemetal bowl jeonju positions itself as koreas culinary and cultural capital its small but colorful and vibrant food here is spectacular  both the everpresent bibimbap and everything else the night market is madness and ive really enjoyed the national intangible heritage center  it really helped me understand much of what i saw elsewhere in korea

 gyeonggijeon hall historical site
 night market  nambu market  jeonjus colorful market comes alive at the weekend nights its a frenzied bonanza of delicious food
 hanok village walking tour  provided for free outside gyeonggijeon the guide was kind and taught me a lot
 geumsansa temple in gimje  1h bus from jeonju surprisingly stunning peaceful mountain temple
 national intangible heritage center  showcasing korean tradition from across the country fascinating and to the point also hosts cultural performances occasionally  i went to one and it was great

tips

 stay in the hanok village its not a big premium a fun experience and close to everything
 jeonju hosts a sori traditional korean music festival which i just missed seems like a lot of fun  i saw a performance in jeonju and later in busan and it was really enjoyable to me particularly as a classical music nerd

 gwangju 4 nights

naver listhttpsnaverme55rh62yo

gwangju markets itself as a patron of arts and a central place to koreas fierce democracy movement in the 80s the city was briefly captured by prodemocracy protesters who were then massacred by the regime traces of this traumatic event and the democratic heritage it left are evident here gwangjus central location also made for a convenient day trip to stunning mokpo well worth staying overnight and the least uncomfortable route to boseongs green tea plantations   
transport inside gwangju is surprisingly difficult buses are slow often require a transfer and the metro barely goes anywhere plan accordingly

x200b

 gwangju national museum
 gwangju biennale
 asia culture complex  sadly nothing was on when i was here
 gwangju art museum  centered on local artists and issues this museum was different  an authentic experience one of the attendants actually toured the museum with me in english  i had such an amazing time
 daein market
 may 18 park
 sajik park  colourful park nestled on a hill the free observatory at the top offers fantastic nightscape views of gwangju
 may 18th memorial cemetery  a massive memorial with the graves of the victims monuments documenting the events and atrocities and beautiful murals really powerful deeply sad experience
 uijae korean art museum  nestled in mudeungsan this small hand curated museum on the way to wonhyosa has stunning traditional korean paintings
 wonhyosa temple

 boseong gwangju day trip

naver listhttpsnaverme5mb3bnu7

about 2h away from gwangju boseong sits in the heart of koreas tea country  endless plantations dot the countryside i visited the most well known one and the tea museum nearby  i didnt care for tea before but i do now 

 daehan dawon green tea plantation
 boseong tea museum

 mokpo gwangju day trip

naver listhttpsnavermeftuwkbwv

mokpo sits at the very edge of korea a 30min ktx ride from gwangju and boasts amazing views out to sea with countless islands dotting the horizon you can see them from the worlds longest marine cable car or from the top of yudalsan 228m its a vibrant city with rich history  particularly from the japanese colonization mokpo is gorgeous and both the marine cable car and mt yudalsan offer breathtaking views while a day probably didnt do it justice i enjoyed mokpo immensely

 mokpo municipal museum
 marine cable car to gohado walk around the island
 yudalsan mountain

 suncheon 3 nights

naver listhttpsnaverme5tiwcn1q

suncheons primary draw are the stunning wetlands which draw birdwatchers from all across korea even if youre not into birds its an amazing place  the landscape is stunning almost alien the locals were exceptionally kind to me here the night market was a blast and the suncheonman bay wetlands are absolutely stunning

 suncheonman bay wetlands  endless reed fields and calm waters hosting lots of birds supremely beautiful
 night market  aretjang
 suncheon bay national garden  massive gardens with lots of themes traditional gardens world gardening etc a nice day out but not a must imo  nothing inherently korean about them they just happen to be here
 naganeupseong fortress 1h by bus

tip stay in suncheon instead of yeosu i was on the fence but going anywhere from suncheon was significantly easier and getting to yeosu was easy

 yeosu suncheon day trip

naver listhttpsnaverme5ewed3gg

yeosu is a mere 17min from suncheon by ktx and is famous for its marine views cuisine and laid back vibe

 yi sunshin plaza  see a replica of a korean turtleship used to defeat the japanese in the imjin war
 hyangiram hermitage  spectacular cliffside seaside location 1h by bus
 nangman pocha street  food street near the harbor

tip try a local seafood dish  rock octopus is the specialty here

 busan 5 nights

naver listhttpsnavermexn6peslp

koreas second city busan offers much of seouls hectic vibe and rich culture as well as fabulous beaches and beautiful seaside parks busan loves seafood and is rich in history from the korean war  un forces landed here the last bastion of the south compared to seoul busan was more layed back and much more diverse  i saw very different sights in a short time

 central busan

 jalgachi fish market  massive fish market its not the stalls outside  its the massive seaside structure you can pick a fishcreature and have it cooked for you on the spot 2nd floor
 busan history museum
 biff busan international film festival  plaza
 gujke market
 yongdusan park

 seomyeon

 seomyeon market  the busiest market i encountered in korea what a thrill
 busan citizens park great place to enjoy the sun between the skyscrapers and recover from seomyeon market
 cultural performance  national gugak center  i saw a performance of traditional korean music which was great the city seems to host events here quite often

 gwangalli

 gwangalli beach  ultimate night views and fabulous beer breweries

 oryukdo

 un memorial cemetery  busan was where the un force landed in the korean war and its fallen are interred in this powerful place

 haedong

 haedongyunggunsa temple  famous temple near the beach seriously busy
 haeunde beach  smooth sandy beach within spitting distance of busans center  right beneath the skyscrapers

 taejongdae

 taejongdae park  tall cliffs with beautiful rock formations make for a beautiful seaside stroll

 around busan

 seukbulsa temple  featuring massive buddhist carvings etched into the mountainside getting here is somewhat more difficult 1h bus and hike but this small temple is very special serene  and the carvings are just mesmerizing
 beomeosa temple  one of koreas largest most beautiful temples if you arrive in busan by bus you can easily store your luggage and visit from the bus terminal  its very close
 heosimcheong spa jimjilbbang  traditional korean hot baths  a cultural rite of passage and a delight to knees aching after climbing to seukbulsa

 jejudo 7 nights 6 days

naver listhttpsnavermex0zmht4t jejusi seogwipo and sites across the island

socalled hawaii of korea jeju is full of stunning natural sights  beaches cliffs rock formations a massive lava cave and koreas highest mountain hallasan jeju is also famous for its black pork and delicious citrons

 jejusi 3 nights

jejusi is jejus biggest city and looks and feels like any other city in korea theres nothing wrong with it  but i vastly preferred seogwipo

 arario museum  challenging deeply unsettling and among the most unique thoughtprovoking museums ive seen highly recommended despite pricy ticket
 dongmun market
 43 peace park 1h bus  memorial site dedicated to the yearslong  jeju massacre  among the most bizarre tragic historical events ive ever heard of whose consequences still deeply affect the island
 jeju stone park 35m from peace park  dedicated to the jeju peoples extensive use of the local volcanic rock  from tools to housing to religion and legend  as well as a museum housing hallasans craziest stone creations

 seogwipo 4 days

seogwipo is small walkable laid back and surrounded by natural beauty i really enjoyed my time here

 jeongbang waterfall  spills out to the ocean unique and very scenic
 lee jung seop art museum  small museum dedicated to a beloved local artist right in the citys center the works were very special  i loved it
 seogwipo olle market
 saesom island  small island park with views towards seogwipo very relaxing
 cheonjiyeon waterfall  beautiful and conveniently located but doesnt stand out compared compared to the other waterfalls
 daepo jusangjeolli cliffs  cool hexagonal cliffs near the coast
 cheonjeyeon waterfalls
 jeju olle 6  7 trails scenic hiking trails going around the coast and into seogwipo beautiful and very fun

 west jeju from seogwipo

 jeju museum of contemporary art  far small and not particularly interesting do not recommend
 osulloc tea museum  cute but very touristy  i wouldnt go through the effort again
 sanbanggulsa temple  beautiful temple in a particularly scenic location couple this with the nearby yeongmori coast
 yeongmori haean coast  stunning unique rock cliffs right outside sanbanggulsa strongly recommend

 east jeju from seogwipo

i went from seogwipo to the majanggul cave and from there headed on to seongsan this was a bit of a long ride 2h to seogwipo 1h30m back but fairly convenient

 seongsan ilchulbong  the famed sunset peak is a great place to watch the sunrise over the sea its very unique and a short but rewarding hike to the top 20min the surrounding seongsan village is also nice and there are plenty of scenic spots to rest along the way
 majanggul  gargantuan lava cave stunning lava formations and wonderful explanations on site

 hallasan national park

towering at 1950m hallasan  koreas tallest mountain  dominates jeju always menacingly towering in the background flocked by a ring of clouds

i went up the seongpanak trail and down the gwaneumsa trail which made for a full scenic day of hiking i took the first bus to seongpanak from jejusi but access from seogwipo is much easier

hallasan was amazing and one of the greatest highlights of my trip

 verdict

everything is much more relaxed in jeju the nature is stunning the buses are slow but you dont mind theres endless beautiful hiking paths olles

ive really enjoyed my time here  though getting around did require a bit more planning and thought though by no means difficult

tip prioritize seogwipo jejusi isnt bad but it has no advantage over seogwipo  most places are more accessible from there the city itself is nicer and getting to and from the airport is still easy

 gyeongju 3 nights

naver listhttpsnavermextb1zhnc

gyeongju was the seat of the ancient silla dynasty which ruled korea for a thousand years silla kings and aristocrats were buried in bizarre earthen mounds which still dot the city today its incredibly beautiful and very eerie gyeongju is very small and walkable  all the sites here are merely a few minutes apart by foot

i arrived in a particularly busy time  your experience will likely vary

 geumgwangcheong tombs imagine your local neighborhood park imagine it filled with giant earth mounds of ancient kings this is it and its an awesome place to chill
 daereungwon tombs  right across the street from geumgwangcheong but much busier
 inwangdong tombs  this is a bigger park also housing cheomseongdae which is speculated to be a tiny ancient star observatory
 banwolseong fortress site  great views over surrounding gyeongju
 donggung gwa wolji  remnants of a palace over a small pond open late and lit up which is very pretty
 hwangnyeongsa ruined temple site  the largest temple in korea built around a nine story wooden pagoda stood here for 700 years before being razed to the ground by the mongols today little to nothing remains  its a hauntingly beautiful site theres a small museum dedicated to the temple hoping to reconstruct it someday
 bunhwangsa temple  right across the road this tiny temple is very picturesque  it houses a brick pagoda and is just a great place to chill
 gyeongju national museum  this is my favourite museum in korea displaying the treasures extracted from the silla tombs organized beautiful and not overwhelming
 woljeonggyo bridge  brilliant traditional wooden bridge go at sunset or at night when its lit up
 bulguksa temple and seokguram grotto  one of koreas most stunning temples the bus here is low frequency and busy still worth it in my opinion 30m bus to the temple another 10min bus or 1h unexciting hike to the grotto

tip try the gyeongju bread tiny buns filled with bean paste really fun

 golgulsa temple stay 1 night 2 days

about an hour from gyeongju by bus golgulsa is one of koreas most unique temples known for seonmudo the zen way of war a traditional korean buddhist martial art staying here involved seonmudo practices meditation traditional temple food and an amazing demonstration which you can still see just visiting the temple at 1500 tuesat

golgulsa was perhaps my favourite experience from korea and taught me a lot i will now attempt to apply in my life as a philosophy student golgulsa was simply amazing

even if you dont stay here come see the seonmudo demonstration the way these people can move is unreal

 andong 3 nights

naver listhttpsnaverme5ur9m0j0

andong is known for its particularly strong soju and its strong tradition of mask dances  a loud korean cultural feast of dancing and music i visited during the yearly mask dance festival  and it was one of the best times i had on korea cool performances great food and soju friendly peeps and just a really fun time

 hahoe folk village  settled by the same clan for hundreds of years by far the prettiest traditional village ive seen theres often a mask dance show which originated here  its so much fun 1h bus
 hahoe mask museum  dive into the tradition of mask dances in korea and across the world
 dosan seowon traditional confucian academy  while far from andong 1h40m by bus and not very big its such a scenic place and taught me a bit about confucianism  which i find deeply fascinating as a philosophy student
 confucian culture museum  on the way back from dosan fascinating to me not a must otherwise transport is infrequent 1 bus per hour

 gangneung 2 nights 1 day

naver listhttpsnaverme5tiwjrrq

the biggest city in gangwondo nestled between the mountains and picturesque coastline gangneung is beautiful layed back and has a particularly strong coffee culture  which i really enjoyed

i had planned much more time in gangneung but squeezed in golgulsa instead however i planned my day here exquisitely and saw much of what gangneung has to offer  its been a blast

 early seaside ktx to jeongdongjin  the worlds closest train station to the sea and wonderful seaside views
 unification park  on the way back from jeongdongjin i planned to see the nearby north korean submarine  but it was closed  still saw it from afar which was cool and had to walk alongside the highway which was not cool
 anmok coffee street  awesome coffee with a great sea views
 ojukheon  former residence of several known joseon scholars some of the cultural highlights were lost on me a dumb foreigner but it was beautiful and interesting
 gyeongpo beach  beautiful beach with a really fun atmosphere walked here along gyeongpo lake

 sokcho 3 nights

naver listhttpsnavermefoh47zan sokcho and seoraksan

famous as the easiest departure point to seoraksan sokcho itself is my favourite seaside city in korea  beautiful beach stunning ocean views lots of seafood sokcho sure loves the massive terrifying crabs a fun market and the very cool abai village

seoraksan national park beloved  almost revered  across korea absolutely lived up to the hype

 abai village  home to people of north korean refugee descent the highlight of this tiny nestled village is the traditional north korean cuisine delicious
 yeongeumjeong pavilion
 yeongnangho lake
 jungang market  go for a chimaek fried chicken and beer here  with the amazing local craft beer
 cheoksan hot springs jimjilbang  great after seoraksan
 naksansa temple 45m bus   one of the most beautiful temples in korea with seaside views a massive stone bodhisattva and splendid autumn foliage

 seoraksan national park

i was satisfied with one meticulously planned day in seoraksan whose beauty genuinely brought me to tears seoraksan is also exceptionally compact  theres so so much you can see in such a short time

i took the first bus to the seoraksan small park and visited these sites in the following order

 somheungsa temple  small picturesque temple  youll see the huge bronze buddha on the way  cant be missed youll have about an hour to explore here before heading to the
 seorak cable car  take the first one 0830 its not too busy then and the morning light on the mountains is divine it gets busy later
 ulsanbawi  a series of bare granite peaks towering over the mountain valleys the hike here takes about 4h return it passes through a stunning buddhist hermitage with hanja characters etched on the huge rocks a supremely beautiful sight
 biryong waterfall hike all the way to the towangseong falls viewpoint this scenic trail winds along an intimate deep mountain valley alongside a stream before ascending to a stunningly beautiful viewpoint about 2h round trip

overall i arrived around 0700 and finished it about 1700  in a very leisurely pace  and got to see the area from three high viewpoints  all in a single day

 7 accommodation

hostels are great across korea  
  
nice hostel 4 bed dorms some privates 2000045000krw average 2500030000

i stayed mostly in hostels aiming for a 4 bed dorm in a nice hostel ive sometimes stayed in 6 bed dorms and sometimes in a private roomhanok traditional korean accommodation but 4 bed dorms made up the vast majority hostels in korea are clean comfortable and not terribly expensive accommodation ranged 2000050000 per night with the vast majority between 2600035000

i used bookingcom to book accommodations on previous trips i used hostelworld but its not as prevalent here

 8 transportation

public transport in korea should be a source of worldwide adoration and envy  
  
intracity busmetro 1400 with tmoneycashbee card free40min transfer average 3 rides  4200 intercity bus 800028000 depending on distance and speed ktx fast train 200045000 depending on speed and distance

convenient frequent and inexpensive transport in korea is also very coherent take the train once take the intercity bus once get on a city bus and the metro once and congratulations you can get absolutely anywhere in the country no exceptions

as youve probably heard elsewhere google maps and other western apps are worse than useless here use naver maps my pick or kakao maps its a bit of a learning curve but convenient and fearsomely accurate

 intercity

fear the holidays prebookprebuy or you will face the consequences otherwise just show up and go wherever whenever

i ended up mostly using intercity buses and utilising the ktx for day trips the buses are convenient frequent and fast and go virtually anywhere anytime

x200b

 train

where available trains are usually the best option most of them are fast and you can prebook your tickethttpswwwletskorailcomebizbfebizbfforeignpr16100dogubun1 with a foreign credit card far in advance stations are usually conveniently located and very easy to figure out and navigate

the ktx and srt trains are fastest no discernible difference between them once you slip into the slow train territory buses are almost always the better option

 intercity bus

intercity buses are fast convenient and ubiquitous  they connect the most random places with such high frequency its honestly shocking this was my main method of traveling and i faced little to no difficulty look for the big white screens in every bus depot where you can buy your ticket in english with your foreign card the only major hassle is that you cant prebook tickets with a foreign card and must buy them in person at the bus depot thankfully this was only necessary during the holidays  i bought tickets on the spot with no fuss anywhere

you can also see whether seats are available onlinehttpswwwbustagoorkr  you just cant reserve them

there are two intercity bus networks  the intercity buses and the express buses which leave from different terminals in practice ive only used intercity buses just make sure youre going to the intercity bus terminal and not the express bus terminal and youre golden

x200b

 intracity

get a transport card  tmoneycashbee theyre interchangeable anything else is barbarism available at every convenience store gs257elevencu where you also recharge them sadly cash only works for all buses and metros

 city buses

city buses are quite convenient even in the smaller cities tap on and tap off with your transport card stations usually show when the next bus is coming  theyre fairly accurate but naver is more accurate in a pickle trust naver

english translation on the bus is hitandmiss but still legible if you read hangeul the korean script youre all set

 metro

korean cuisine hanshik is spicy as in  full of spices  not necessarily hot opinionated and always packs a punch as a foodie i was inspired and amazed  a definite highlight of my trip sitting down in random local restaurants eating whatever theyre cooking and chatting with the patrons made for some of my best times hanshik is ubiquitous healthy  and cheap

otherwise theres plenty of fast food places fried chicken some chinese and vietnamese cuisine european restaurants are surprisingly rare

vegans vegetarians  beware you might have a hard time here i eat vegan at home and completely dropped the notion here  its really difficult

eating alone is easy despite whatever youve read  most places seated me before i could even ask i was never refused anywhere on the contrary  i was eagerly welcomed even at peak times

 10 the korean people

the koreans are simply put the best

the koreans werent merely kind hosts  they were active participants in my trip

at every point and turn i was asked about me and my trip given advice gifted food drinks sweets people ran after me in the rain offering umbrellas leapt up from their restaurant seats to help me decipher the menu helped me improve my korean with endless patience greeted me in shy english ive even been randomly hugged in the street  because im traveling alone because im trying to speak korean or because im an israeli

i cannot fathom what inspired these people to show me such overwhelming generosity but ive been brought to tears by the kindness shown to me here i was never maltreated harassed or even given a cold shoulder

my efforts to adhere to the culture and to speak the language were met with eager appreciation i was often complimented on my terrible korean and was treated with great enthusiasm anywhere

youll get stared at sometimes its not malice its curiosity a smile small bow and polite hello melts all tension right away

koreans are outgoing and joyful people here are really passionate theyll exclaim get excited and be really really into whatever is happening right now  a good meal a good view a cool painting whatever its a kind of childlike excitement

koreans dont do small talk  "

gangwon,115 days in seoul and gangwon,"hi i dont have much details to share yet as im in my very preliminary stages of planning but wanted to get some input before i start making my bookings heres what i have right now

 time first half of february 2025
 main goal to play with and take nice photos with and of snow explore
 other goals shopping relaxing and eating eg going to cafes free and easy
 no hiking or very strenuous activity
 couple late 20searly 30s
 we are planning to rent a car i saw suggestions to try sk car rental since its cheaper than lotte and also to avoid third party operators like klook the cheapest quote i got was 660490 krw please let me know if this is reasonableexpensive and any other alternatives i should look at
 thinking of spending half our time in seoul and half in gangwon

places on my list
 jumunjin beach this is the beach im most keen to see but im open to other suggestions if this is too out of the way
 wondaeri birch forest
 eobi ice valley

placesactivities im considering
 stone creek for the ice valley view its either this or eobi and i think the latter looks more impressive
 alpaca world generally great reviews but some people say the animals are mistreated
 garden of morning calm i see this on most lists but im not crazy about the neon lights to be brutally honest they look a bit tacky to me in photos but i imagine they could look a lot more beautiful in person
 skiingsnow activity resorts and parks none in particular yet
 nami island only because ive seen it on a lot of lists im not sure what the main draw is
 pocheon sanjeong lake the activities look cute and fun but this seems out of the way
 strawberry picking

places im skipping
 petite france italian village nothing to do
 lotte world seems most rides will be closed and queues for the remaining ones are insane

in case youre wondering why its all me im the planner in the relationship my partner usually has zero input and requirements except no waking up early no rushing no walking too much food car

based on my very initial research some of the places im looking at are quite far apart so hopefully the car helps a lot but im nervous since weve never driven in snow before i saw a post here saying korean drivers are very rude and impatient and theres no google maps function i have never used naver maps before and always rely on google maps while travelling

since the main draw for us would be snow over anything else food shopping typical city entertainment should i plan for more time in gangwon instead is there anywhere else i should visit are there any hidden gems

what are good and convenient areas to base ourselves in within seoul and gangwon

how easy is it to shop for things in gangwon if needed eg cheap stores like daiso convenience stores supermarkets clothing medicine

tia"
gangwon,the han commanderies issue a controversial and popular topic online used mainly by chinese and japanese nationalist trolls to claim and justify that korea and koreans are a product of the han dynasty and the chinese my two cents,"since ive seen quite a few people koreans and non koreans alike bring up the issue of han commanderies up quite often i firstly recommend you to read my posts that ive made a few years back because ive spent quite a fair bit of time debunking and deconstructing not only gija joseons historicity but also on why the han commanderies subsequently cannot be in pyongyang 

the whole premise that the han commanderies is located in pyongyang is based off of the belief that gija and his successors resided in pyongyang followed by man wiman and his succesors of which there is almost no archaeological evidence that has been verified even by japanese colonial era archaeologists because it has nothing to do with the korean peninsula to begin with

the geobody known as the korean peninsula believe it or not is first mentioned in the sanguozhi weizhi dongyizhuan from the book of wei one of the texts from the collection of the 24 histories of china in the late 3rd century ce by the historian chen shou prior to that its even doubtful that the han dynasty inhabitants let alone court even knew the existence of the korean peninsula let alone the japanese islands another point to raise is that wa or wae is quite often conflated with japan during the han dynasty period but that too is quite problematic given the fact that in the book of the later han it states that the xianbei chieftain tanshihuai captured wa people to make them catch fish for his tribal confederation and the fact that wa or wae people referred to being to the east of kuaiji commandery hangzhou zhejiang province in southeastern china its only in the book of wei that wae refers to the people residing in kyushu island notably himiko 

the han commanderies were in western liaoning and eastern hebei provinces not in pyongan hwanghae hamgyeong gangwon and gyeonggi provinces that has become consensus since the japanese colonial period in the 1910s 

firstly when lelang commandery which was allegedly claimed to be in pyongyang since the 15th to 16th century ce by joseon literati like han baek gyeom and later on by jeong yak yong who believed in the historicity of gija coming to the korean peninsula that was the fundamental basis of the invented historical tradition that gave the justification for neo confucian ideology in medieval korea lelang commandery is in fact described in much earlier chinese geography texts most notably the shujing sugyeong from the han dynasty period 206 bce  220 ce to be where the jieshi mountain the eastern end of the great wall and the pae pei river meet at one point 

li tao yuan a 6th century ce geographer of the northern wei conflated goguryeos pyongyang which was in liaoyang liaoning province with the han commandery of lelang which was why in his shujingzhu sugyeongju he claimed that the pei river flowed in a southwesterly direction into the sea which again was not based on an independent survey of the geography of that area but asking questions and extrapolating based on his brief interview with a goguryeo envoy that visited the northern wei court at the time

  
if pyongyang is where lelang commandery was well clearly jieshi mountain is supposed to be all over the way in north korea which means qin shi huangdi han wudi cao cao sui yangdi and tang taizong all went up a mountain in northwest korea and left their poetry and writing inscribed on the slopes of the mountains unfortunately for both japanese imperialists and chinese revisionists jieshi mountain is all over way thousands of kilometers to the west in qinhuangdao city to the east of beijing

since about 1987 you begin to see geography texts from the peoples republic of china by a chinese geographer tan qixiang showing the eastern end of the great wall going beyond shanhaiguan pass in qinhuangdao firstly to dandong liaoning province then all the way to mudanjiang heilongjiang province and other times all the way to the south of pyongyang pyongan province this is based on the fact that imanishi ryu and tsuda soukichi claimed that the eastern end of the great wall reached pyongyang or south of that so that it would satisfy the conditions of pyongyang being where lelang commandery is obviously they have found and have not yet validated any remains of the great wall stretching into the korean peninsula so far which is why the chinese great wall claims are bogus

  
additionally the pei river according to other earlier han dynasty texts from the 1st century ce such as the shuowen jiezi seolmoon haeja which is said to flow in a southeasterly direction into the sea all the rivers on the western side of the korean peninsula flow either in a westerly direction or southwesterly direction into the yellow sea the only rivers that flow in a southeasterly direction are in the eastern coast of the korean peninsula but unfortunately you find no lelang artefacts or evidence of han dynasty settlements in the eastern part of the korean peninsula more so than the western part thats why the pei river cannot be in pyongan hwanghae gyeonggi let alone even liaoning province the only closest rivers that flow in a southeasterly direction are in hebei province such as the daling river luan river hai river or chaobai river thats why the pei river is not the taedong river or chongchon river as tsuda or imanishi claimed over 100 years ago

  
thirdly there have been recently translated excerpts of the diaries of sekino tadashi and other japanese officials in the chosen colonial government at the time from the 1910s to 1920s by the inha university gojoseon research institute and it actually talks about them visiting the antiques market in beijing to purchase han dynasty artefacts for the lelang display museum in pyongyang dr moon seong jae who was formerly at inha university gojoseon research institute has done quite an extensive job translating and discussing all these in detail in his 2016 book the han commanderies were in china unfortunately you have some academic at the university of helsinki called andrew miles logie who appears to have conflict of interest with ties to the confucius institute at the university of helsinki trying to argue that anyone who puts forward the argument that the han commanderies were not in the korean peninsula are nationalist pseudohistorians in fact ive never seen him ever deconstruct this evidence despite claiming to diagnose and debunk pseudohistory his phd dissertation as well as his recent publications are unfortunately a bunch of ad hominem and strawman attacks often aimed exclusively against korean heterodox scholarship that never properly grapple with these arguments but try to attack the alleged ethno nationalist character or persona of scholars with opposing views 

  
fourthly jeong in bo who was a historian in colonial era korea during the 1920s to 1940s before disappearing during the korean war refuted japanese claims of having found the jeomjaehyeon stele in the middle of a field in pyongyang and finding hundreds of stamp seals of the governors of various commanderies that were allegedly excavated from lelang tombs the gist of the counterarguments put forward by jeong was that prior to the 4th and 5th centuries ce there were no steles erected but rather inscriptions were etched into the side of mountains such as what qin shi huangdi and han wudi did when they went up mt jieshi in hebei province some 2100 to 2200 years ago the fact that a 1st century bce stele would exist and be found in the middle of a field that was coincidentally found by sekino tadashi is not only suspicious because its an anachronistic find 

moreover the reason why jeong cast high doubt on the seals of the governors was not only the sheer number that they found which you dont even find in major cities such as luoyang and xian that were han dynasty capitals as well as satellite cities within the han empire at the time but also because there are anachronistic titles that simply did not exist a good example is that the governor of lelang commandery during the han dynasty was called lelang taishou whereas during the shortlived xin dynasty during wang mangs reign in the 1st century ce lelang was changed to lexian and a taishou governor was called a dayun some of the seals excavated say lelang dayun and lexian taishou which clearly shows that it is a forgery whilst if they only found lelang taishou and lexian dayun exclusively it would hold more credibility 

its also bizarre that they find very little ban liang or wu zhu cash currency that was used by the qin han cao wei and western jin dynasties in north korea even though a major epicentre of han commerce and settlement was in pyongyang you can find hordes of roman coins in england france spain portugal switzerland romania greece turkey egypt algeria morocco libya israel palestine syria lebanon and elsewhere that were formerly roman empire territories but you hardly find anything of similar quantity in north korea you have to wonder why when you do in guangdong fujian jiangxi anhui hubei hunan jiangsu zhejiang shaanxi shanxi shandong hebei and henan provinces

fifthly in 1993 in jinzhou city western liaoning province a farmer found the seal of the lintun commandery easternmost of the four han commanderies governor in a vineyard which was reported to the archaeological teams at liaoning and jilin universities at the time professor bok gi dae at inha university gojoseon research institute was a phd student at the time when he actually visited that place and this appeared in a news report in mbc way back in 1997 he published this finding in a korean archaeological journal but korean historians or archaeologists did not respond to it because they too blindly hold onto the preestablished consensus for the past 100 or so years some people have spent decades building a career based on this japanese colonial archaeologicalhistorical framework that they have too much to lose if they overturn this which is why quite often they attack people who deviate from the status quo 

sixthly in 2014 they found the tomb of a lelang commandery inhabitant han hyeon do in a district in beijing that was being renovated to build a new set of apartment buildings from the 5th to 6th centuries ce this stirred a lot of controversy both in china and korea because according to the status quo historical narrative the han commandery of lelang was supposedly destroyed in 313 ce by goguryeo during micheon of goguryeos reign this is incorrect micheon of goguryeo never destroyed lelang commandery if you read the samguk sagi or the 24 histories of china in fact lelang commandery was only extinguished in the mid 5th century ce after the northern wei and goguryeo that were in a marriage alliance divided the northern yan state that was ruled by the feng family which happens to be in an area spanning western liaoning and eastern hebei province 

subsequently you would have people raise the lelang commandery transfer theory from pyongyang to qinhuangdao which is quite a popular claim that was first coined by imanishi ryu to claim that lelang commandery was in pyongyang from 108 bce to 313 ce before being moved all the way to qinhuangdao when zhang tong a chieftain of the lelang inhabitants took 2000 residents all the way to pyongyang and then defected to the murong xianbei ruled northern yan state in qinhuangdao hebei province where a replacement lelang commandery was established across a span of 2000 to 3000 kilometres mind you even in the 17th century ce when park ji won a joseon era diplomat set out from seoul to beijing it took them 6 months to travel that distance when roads were better developed than 1300 years earlier during the western jin dynasty goguryeo would have surely intercepted zhang tong before he escaped to qinhuangdao from pyongyang if lelang was really in pyongyang but they did not you have to wonder why well the answer is simple because lelang commandery was not in the korean peninsula and the murong xianbei northern yan state never controlled any part of the korean peninsula as we all know these events all happened in hebei province which is why zhang tong and the escape of 2000 inhabitants from lelang which was a border facing region between goguryeo and the northern yan was feasible and without difficulty or being captured

its quite ironic but chinese often complain about japanese imperialism but are more than ready to use japanese colonial imperialist historiography when it suits their agenda thats why chinese complaints about japanese imperialism come across as disingenuous in my eyes considering their new revisionist historiography vis a vis korea is not only based on sinocentrism chinese chauvinism but also japanese imperialist historiography"

gangwon,exploring gangwon do ,"hello
i am from australia and i will be travelling to south korea soon 
i would like to explore gangwon do after busan seoul to jeju island to busan to gangwon do  anywhere else i must visit 

i am just wondering if a car is needed to explore gangwon do whats the best way to get there from busan and where should i look for accommodation in gangwon do what little town areas would be best to stay in 

all advice and recommendations are appreciated "
gangwon,how feasible is having a team in chuncheon,"two years ago i asked on this sub why there was no baseball team in jejuhttpswwwredditcomrkbocommentsv2dukawhyistherenoteaminjejuwillthereeverbe even though it is a fairly popular island with a football club i was told that it is because it is far from the mainland which means plenty of expenses and fatigue incurred by traveling to and from games

and i get it after all there is no npb team in okinawa even though it is a fairly popular group of islands with football and basketball teams for the same reasons

but now i have i realized that there is one place that could use a baseball team chuncheon the capital city of gangwon province it has three things going for it a central position relative to its northerly location a rail link to seoul and an upgradable baseball stadium

should one of the bears and twins decide that they no longer want to play second fiddle to the other at jamsil  then here is a readymade area for them to make fully theirs just look at npbs fighters who finally found their footing after moving to hokkaido from tokyo the same situation could apply here

but what do you think will this eventually happen let me know in the comments"

gangwon,looking for friends,"hii   i moved to korea about 4 months ago and havent made many friends its quite difficult to befriend anyone since i live in gangwon i travel to seoul some weekends so i dont mind hanging out over there  

if anyone is keen to hangout feel free to chat with me"
gangwon,inje county john doe 2003 gangwon south korea,"at 1040am on friday april 18th 2003 a 56 year old man who ran a junk shop  was out repairing a guard rail as a side job with three colleagues on the side of national highway 31 near gwangchiryeong pass in inje county gangwon province south korea when he found three rice bags even though he was there to repair the guard rail and that the bags seemed suspicious the man thought that they could possibly have some scrap metal from the surrounding farms in the area that had been abandoned his main job being a junk collector he decided to search the bags however when he reached a hand inside he quickly recoiled in shock when he realized he had not felt metal but that he had touched a human leg the man immediately contacted the local police and upon their arrival an investigation began that is after they reformed their murder investigation group that they had actually disbanded just the morning before april 18th

police arrived and were immediately shocked to find that all three of the rice bags contained the dismembered remains of an adult male one bag held the mans neck and chest another held his abdomenthighs and the last bag held his legs the police enlisting the help of military forces searched the surrounding area for the head and hands of the deceased but were unable to locate them an autopsy performed by the nfs national forensics service would find that the mans body along with being cut into three different halves had been stabbed over 20 times these stab wounds were described as deep and that 21 of the knife wounds were located on the chest 7 of those stab wounds had even pierced the decedents heart as well as caused damage to his ribs the decedents body had been drained of its blood leaving investigators unable to estimate a time at which he had died

there were no signs of resistance leading investigators to believe that the decedent was restrained while he was killed even though his hands were never located they also believe that anger or resentment were involved in the ferocity of the violence inflicted upon the deceased police assumed that the decedent had been incapacitated through means of drugs or alcohol but this was dismissed when his blood alcohol content was 005 meaning he was slightly under the influence but still aware of what was going on around him no drugs such as anesthetics were found in his blood either this gave further credence to the restraint theory 

the murder weapon used was believed to have been a sashimi knife a logging chainsaw was believed to have been utilized in the dismemberment of the body investigators also believe that he was killed in the middle of a premeditated assault with the dismemberment occuring after the fact the premeditation factor is supported by the blood being drained from the body to prevent blood spots which settle 3 to 4 hours after death from appearing it is also supported by the decision to cut bones off instead of the joints of the decedent which shows the perpetrator is proficient with a logging chainsaw one peculiar thing to note was that broken parts commonly seen at the ends of felled trees were also visible on the bones of the corpse said inspector kang changkwon of the seoul metropolitan police agencys forensic investigation team this supports their belief that the perpetrator has experience with tree cutting due to the patterns observed in the cut bones being akin to those seen on skillfully cut trees they believe the perpetrator may be a local or from another forested region of south korea due to their knowledge of the lesstraveled area investigators also theorize that the decedent was acquainted with the perpetrator but have never gone into detail about why they believe this 

the decedent was an adult male of a sturdy muscular build who was 180cm 5 9 tall and weighed between 68 kgs 149 lbs and 90 kgs 198 lbs his age was estimated to be between 20 to 40 years old his blood type was found to be type a also of note were signs of a cosmetic procedure that had been performed on the decedents genitals done to enlarge them this procedure has been known to be popular with gangsters and those in the entertainment industry police believe the man was possibly violently murdered by a gang they also believe that there is some sort of grudge involved in the murder due to the violence seen in that the crime being described as overkill without the head or hands of the deceased the police also cannot identify him easily

police created and distributed leaflets in an attempt to find new information about the deceased they mailed information about the deceased to the families of 25000 people reported missing across south korea in 2003 the cost of this mail campaign was 5 million won or just short of 6000 usd today only three replies worth investigating were received and all were proven to not be a match through genetic analysis the entirety of inje county was even searched for six months for any missing man in their 20s to 40s who could be their decedent this search resulted in no new leads

 close attention was paid to the rice bags in which the remains were discovered these bags were found to have been manufactured in china this information led investigators to theorize that the decedent and perpetrator were possibly koreanchinese nationals however due to the high amount of bags of the same brand being in circulation at the time no new leads came from this also the fact that the decedents arms and head were never found lends more credence to the victim being a documented south korean citizen they might have incinerated the head and hands or disposed of them in a body of water to prevent identification via dental or fingerprint records investigators believe that the remains were left on the side of the mountainous road as a warning to others which leads to the possibility of gang involvement this does not mean that he could have also been involved in a business dispute of some kind and was taken out by a rival or an angry employee the perpetrators must have known the area the remains were discovered in well if they went further into the forests in the mountains around the road to dispose of the remains by burial they could never have been found or would have been found a lot later leaving the remains on the roadside gives off the vibe of the perpetrator letting others know that this is what happens when you wrong me

on july 31st of 2015 south koreas national assembly abolished the 25year term limit on 1st degree murder and implemented the taewani act meaning that there is no longer a statute of limitations for murder cases that have happened after august 1 2000 thankfully the cold case team for the provincial police agency in gangwon are still investigating what has come to be known as the inje gwangchiryeong pass incident and due to solving two other longterm cold cases recently they are optimistic that they can solve this one as well they are still tackling new leads and comparing data from missing persons with the decedents available dna however with limited manpower they are still pursuing justice for the victims of violent crimes in the cold cases they investigate until their perpetrators are found

gangwon,thoughts on pd intervention in relationship flow,"ive seen the past two seasons of transit love recently and currently watching the 3rd season i cant help but compare  contrast between these shows since the producers are the same i just cant help but feel that the producers seem to intervene and disrupt more the developing relationships in my siblings romance compared to transit love

in transit love the only interventiondisruption is the prohibition to date the ex until they get to the last date in jeju  they allow relationships to develop naturally and even if a guy and girl keeps choosing each other all the time they dont disrupt them

i just felt that this trip to gangwon province they added rules to not choose someone they dated previously to create interference and keeps things interesting  the relationships just seem too early to be disrupted and not given a chance to grow naturally for example ss said that this date is kind of special since its an overnight trip opportunity to travel with someone  i think she would have chosen jung sub if she wasnt prohibited from choosing him  same with cho a who said she likes getting to know someone at a deeper level than getting to know someone new again

i understand they need to keep things interesting but they also need to show how relationships develop somewhat naturally when the participants find that connection the series is only a few weeks and they dont have the luxury of time to get to know people at a deeper level so if they keep pushing them to meet different people vs get to know more the people they gravitate towards it defeats the purpose 

the siblings are already there to create disruption or bridge for their siblings romance so i wish they will just let them choose naturally than imposing these rules that could disrupt early development of relationships"

12bar2red jeonnam dragons  38  8822  43  69  26  32  relegated to k league 2 

 fc seoul won their playoff against k league 2s busan ipark  
 seongnam fc were promoted from k league 2  
 ulsan won their champions league playoff and are in the group stages

its impossible to write a concise summary of the 2018 season  you can get some of the details from the club guide below  but one of the most interesting stories actually comes from k league 2

for context you need to understand a bit about military service for footballers rather than take 2 years out of their career to serve in the military or do some kind of eg desk job service players can join one of two military football teams that play in the k league in k league 1 there is sangju sangmu and in k league 2 there is asan mugunghwa every player in these two teams is on loan for two years from another club in the k league sangju sangu is affiliated with the normal military whilst asan mugunghwa is affiliated with the police serving in the auxilliary police force is another way to do your service

the korean government recently decided to abolish the auxilliary police force by 2023 the police however decided to already wind down their sports teams putting an immediate halt on recruiting players and disbanding the teams in 2019

now the champions of k league 2 last season were asan mugunghwa they were in line for direct promotion to k league 1 to compete in the k league you need to have at least 20 players but by the time the next season started asan would only have 14 players as the loan deals ran out the league gave asan a deadline in november to submit a recruitment plan which they failed to do and so the promotion spot passed to secondplaced seongnam fc although that deadline and hence promotion was missed asan have how submitted a recruitment plan that would see their 14 serving players be supplemented by new signings that indicates the club will transition to an cityowned club with the help of the asan government

funnily or depressingly this is not the first time police fc won k league 2 and missed out on promotion  in 2016 ansan mugunghwa were crowned champions but at the end of that year moved from ansan to asan in line with the leagues policies they were registered as a brand new club

k league 1 club guide

clubs can have up to three foreign players in their squad plus an extra one from another afc nation although rare a player with north korea citizenship is not considered foreign most of those foreign places are taken by brazilians or players from the former yugoslavia eg k league veteran dejan damjanovic the exception to the foreigner rule is the goalkeeper  korean goalkeepers in the 90s were just so bad that a block on recruiting foreign goalieshttpwwwkleagueunitedcom201703foreigngoalkeepersinfavourofhtml was put in place to help encourage development of domestic talent it seems to have worked with korean goalkeepers often being signed abroad in asia at least

there is also a requirement to have u23 players fielded and on the bench with a failure to meet this impacting the number of substitutes that can be made article 30httpswwwkleaguecomaboutcompetition of the league rules

youll notice some of the clubs have a korean chaebol in their team name and even if its not in the name they may still be owned by a corporation behind the scenes this sounds very odd if youre not familiar with it but it is extremely common in japan china and korea it may just be a symptom of some of the teams being relatively recentlyfounded and perhaps isnt that unusual these days think red bull city group majority shareholders in the west however the number of citizen clubs owned by the local city or provincial government is on the rise  gyeongnam fc is one example

a lot of clubs probably like to think they have a derby with fc seoul because well its seoul but the  biggest and probably considered the national derby is the super match  between fc seoul and suwon samsung bluewings montenegrin damjanovic known simply as dejan formerly of seoul and now playing for suwon is the top scorer in this fixture

heres the clubs by last seasons standing and since crests are a bit unstable on reddit at the moment heres an imgur album of all club crests and corresponding home kits for the 2019 seasonhttpimgurcomaw8dbla5

jeonbuk hyundai motors

jeonbuk are the dominant team in korea and one the of the teams you dont want to face in the champions league whoever you are theyve now won 4 out of the last 5 k league 1 titles and a most recent champions league title in 2016

their rise to power over the last decade has been overseen by long term manager choi kanghee choi left at the end of last season to tianjin quanjintianhai daliang yifang fc in china korea seems to have a thing for portuguese managers these days and his replacement is one jos morais morais was assistant manager to jos mourinho for a period but as manager proper hes been a bit shit he was at two clubs in 2018 which included ushering barnsley into relegation to english league one how jeonbuk will fare after choi remains to be seen

although jeonbuk cruised to the league title it would be difficult to call their season an outright success due to a horrendous 15 mins at the end of the second half in a home match against suwon in the champions league quarterfinal they turned the 3 goal deficit around in the seond leg when they travelled to suwon but went out on penalties 

gyeongnam fc

gyeongnam were only promoted from k league 2 the previous season so coming second in k league 1 is something special top scorer in the league marco played his part with 26 goals

gyeongnam will now feature in the champions league for the first time i thought that seems to have put the brakes on too many of their players departing but captain choi youngjun signed for jeonbuk in the winter transfer window a major loss is marco who was also top scorer in k league 2 in the year they were promoted who appears to have followed the money to china also off to china is key centreback park jisoo so basically the backbone of the team from defence to attack has left

ulsan hyundai

known as the horangi   the tigers  ulsan have had intermittent success in asia winning the champions league for the first and only time in 2012 in an unbeaten run

towards the end of the 2018 season ulsan were battling gyeongnam for the second spot which brings with it direct qualification to the champions league group stages rather than having a playoff they lost out but were widely expected to secure a direct qualification spot anyway when they faced daegu fc in the fa cup final ultimately they finished the season on a low losing 51 on aggregate to daegu in the final 

pohang steelers

one of the few clubs that predates the formation of the k league pohang are another of the historical korean powerhouses they hold the record for the most number of champions league title 3 but their last title came in 2009

finishing fourth in the league they were hoping that ulsan would beat daegu in the fa cup final to pass their champions league spot on down but it didnt happen

jeju united

one of the original members of the k league founded as the yukong elephants in the seoul area as part of the decentralisation program they moved to bucheon kind of and were renamed as bucheon sk the decision to move to jeju in 2006 was an abrupt one and understandably deeply unpopular with the fans teams uprooting and moving elsewhere is a bit of a catalyst for the creation of new teams in korea and the fans formed bucheon fc 1995 in the absence of bucheon sk

the reason given for the relocation was to the address the imbalance in football teams being located around seoulgyeonggido and jeju did not have a pro team at the time but there are suggestions the owners sk group wanted to cut their investment and recoup some costs

there were recent rumours that jeju would move yet again back north to yongin but who knows 

jeju had a pretty mediocre season what more can i say

suwon samsung bluewings

suwons 2018 season was a bit bonkers and especially so in their champions league run

in their champions league group in which they were drawn with eventual winners kashima antlers suwon did not manage a single home win however they had managed to get two away wins and going into the final match they still had their fate in their own hands if they could win against group leaders kashima in japan they won 10 getting three away wins and topping the group

manager seo jungwon at a time when suwon were 4th in the league resigned the day before the first leg of their champions league quarterfinal clash with jeonbuk due to fan protests jeonbuk were apparently completely bamboozled by this event and took a 30 beating at home then in the return leg in suwon jeonbuk fought back to win 30 but suwon were able to scrape through on penalties to face kashima antlers yet again in the semis

in the semifinal fixture suwon went 20 up against kashima antlers inside the first 10 minutes but went on to lose 32 in the first leg
soon after manager seo returned as suddenly as he had departed having been gone for just 6 weeks  
in the second leg suwon went a goal down in the first half but came back with 3 in the second half to be on their way to the final after 60 mins played however kashima antlers fought back to get two more goals and win 65 on aggregate and would go on to win the final if you want to relive a part of that rollercoaster night here you gohttpsyoutuberxy8pagy1aq and heres an idea of the atmosphere that nighthttpstwittercomtheafcclstatus1055055104607285248

at one point it looked like they might qualify for the champions league again for the 2019 season but suwon didnt win any of their final five league matches and dropped to 6th

manager seo left again at the end of the season and will manage japans sagan tosu recently captain kim eunsun was released from the club for drinkdriving the drama just never ends

daegu fc

prior to the world cup daegu were languishing at the bottom of the table but after the return they found some kind of consistent form helped out by world cup hero goalkeeper jo hyeonwoo they really peaked at the right time as daegu made it to the fa cup final and against the odds defeated ulsan hyundai 51 on aggregate meaning for the first time they will feature in the champions league this is no mean feat for team whose best ever finish in the top flight is 7th place if they carry over their momentum into the 2019 season the year could be one of their most successful ever they will also be playing in a new footballspecific stadium this year

gangwon fc

gangwon are a fairly midbottom team i dont really know what to say about them they did have the 2ndhighest top scorer in the 2018 season though bosnian uros deric they also had the worst colour scheme in the league last season their kit is slightly improved this season

incheon united

i always like to imagine that incheon chose their strip so that they could be the inter to fc seouls ac milan they even have a nickname nerazzurri another nickname is the durumi    the cranes

incheon spent most of the 2018 season at the very bottom of table and had the jointleakiest defence in the league they brought in norwegian manager jrn andersen midway through the season to turn their fortunes around but even after that they were on the wrong end or the biggest thrashing of the season 70 against gangwon coming into the end of the season though they were playing really nice attacking football even if they didnt always get the result at the split they were still bottom but won 4 out of 5 games to pull themselves up 3 places

it was in attack that incheon shone montenegrin stefan mugosa was their top scorer in his debut season moon seonmin with the best goal celebration in the league also put in a strong performance but has now signed for champions jeonbuk nam junjae returned in the summer to score some bangers costa rican international aguilar was also impressive but has signed for jeju in the new season

sangju sangmu

the military team where other k league players get loaned to to complete their military service their history goes far back in one sense as various military teams were playing way back to the 50s but they were founded for pro footballers to serve their time only in 1984 although they were for pro players they competed in the semipro national league until 2003 when they joined the k league based in gwangju when gwangju fc were formed they moved to sangju

sangju sangmu do not have any foreign players for obvious reasons and cannot compete in the champions league although the chances of ever finishing in a qualifying spot are fairly slim

fc seoul

fc seoul wow what happened having won the league in 2016 albeit somewhat fortuitously and always finishing in the top half if not competing for the title in the past decade nobody expected seoul to be fighting against relegation although relatively solid defensively they scored the least number of goals in the league season of all teams their star foreign players almost all left before the season started including dejan to rivals suwon and were not replaced with the same quality and for many matches seoul played with an allkorean team one bit of good news for the future is that former captain osmar will return from his loan to cezero osaka for the new season

seoul at least managed to avoid relegation by beating busan ipark over two legs in the playoff helped by a red card in the first leg surprisingly they managed to score 3 goals in the first leg in open play

seoul is probably the most popular club in korea im sure helped by the fact that it is the main club in a city of 10 million people  seoul generally has the highest game attendances although it was much reduced last season because they were so crap

starting out as luckygoldstar ie lg fc in chungcheong province the team was permitted to relocate to seoul at the start of the 90s and were renamed as lg cheetahs during the decentralisation period they moved to anyang modifying their name to anyang lg cheetahs after the world cup the team successfully negotiated a move back to seoul and did away with their cheetahs moniker taking their current name fc seoul their founding and rebirth years are both on their badge  1983 and 2004

seongnam fc

gaining direct promotion due to asan mugunghwas situation seongnam is actually the most decorated team in korea

founded in 1989 in seoul as ilhwa chunma they were forced out of seoul and settled in cheonnan for a period in 2000 they moved to seongnam a satellite city of seoul and appended the city name to the name of the club seongnams title drought started when the head of the owner company that backed seongnam died in 2012 and the board were keen to let go of the club seongnam city government took over ownership of the club for the 2014 season and they were renamed seongnam fc seongnam are now back in k league 1 after a 2 year absence

k league 2 clubs

by last seasons standings

jeonnam dragons

jeonbuks jeolla province rivals they finished the previous season on an awful losing streak and were relegated for the first time

asan mugunghwa

police fc they missed promotion despite winning k league 2 and will probably lose their police affiliation by next year

busan ipark

one of the founding members of the k league and another that effectively predates the k league busan were beaten by k league 1 opposition in the prorel playoff for the second year in a row they were the first korean team to win the asian continental title in the 80s

daejeon citizen

one of the first communitycityowned clubs in korea

suwon fc

the other suwon team they featured in k league 1 briefly in 2016

bucheon fc 1995

formed after the departure of jeju united from the city formed in 2007 1995 refers to the year of the organising of the yukong elephant fan club including 1995 in the name is meant to show its a club for the fans or something

bucheon fc 1995 are also one half of the 032 derby with incheon united because they share the same area code 032

winter transfer window activity

from a monetary point of view korea is the biggest net exporterhttpsenynacokrviewaen20190131006600315sectionsportsindex of players in asia in the transfer market this winter window was no different with what i would say were the two biggest stories involving young homegrown korean talent going abroad

the first is that of jeonbuk and national team star centreback kim minjae nicknamed the monster there were rumours of an offer from english side watford but it wasnt clear if there ever was any offer or negotiations  kim himself said he did not know of any interest from watford it doesnt really matter now  kim signed with chinese side beijing sinobo guoan and will see champions league football with them in the new season being drawn in the same group as jeonbuk

the second is hwang inbeom who has signed for mls side vancouver whitecaps hwang inbeom played in k league 2 last season with asan mugunghwa and daejeon citizen but has impressed as a midfield playmaker and is currently seen as a replacement for ki sungyueng in the national team

for a recognisable name for western readers the best i have is englishman jordon mutch who signed for gyeongnam from crystal palace resulting in this awkward photo ophttpspbstwimgcommediadzg3adzvyaakrkqformatjpgnamemedium another recognisable name is mix diskerud on loan to ulsan from man city but he joined the previous year

k league 1s top scorer marco left gyeongnam for hebei china fortune and his replacement is luc castaignos signed from sporting cp his stats in europe havent been great in recent years but he may fare better in korea

there were of course a few hundred domestic internal transfers and number of other foreign player signings  if you want the full list k league uniteds winter transfer trackerhttpwwwkleagueunitedcom2019012019kleaguewintertransfertrackerhtml has it all



history of club football in korea  establishment of the k league

association football was first introduced to korea in 1882 when british royal navy crew harboured at incheon played a game it wasnt until the 1900s that football began to take hold and the first public match was played in 1905 there was a boom in in the 1910s with a number of football clubs being formed and rivalries began to form between clubs in seoul and pyongyang

the first nationwide competition was the all joseon football tournament joseon being the name for korea at the time founded in 1921 there wasnt actually a champion crowned in 1921 as the tournament was cut short due to complaints over refereeing decisions all this was taking place during japanese occupation of korea during most of the first half of the 20th century

according to the kfahttpswebarchiveorgweb20170606162658httpkfaorkrrecordhistoryasp football was the only tonic that could relieve the the national resentment that had accumlated in the hearts as a colony under the japanese empire and was a sprout that could foster the hope of freedom a tad hyperbolic maybe

one side effect of being a japanese colony is that some korean teams were allowed to participate in the emperors cup japans fa cup and in 1935 kyungsung fc kyungsung was a name for seoul during japanese occupation won the tournament becoming the only nonjapanese team to ever do so

the all joseon football tournament ran until wwii

after wwii came korean independence and shortly thereafter the korean war there was football being played during this period continuously when possible the korean national semiprofessional football league was founded in 1964 and is the predecessor to todays tier 3 national league many of the teams during this period were works teams  employed by a company playing under the name of the company but also having a proper job in the company cha bumkun said by some to be the greatest ever asian footballer rose to fame during this period albeit mainly in the bundesliga starting his senior career at the mighty seoul trust bank fc the most astonishing statistic about cha bumkun is he only received one yellow card in his career

finally we get to the establishment of professional football with the korean super league in 1983 now named the k league initially there were only 5 teams and 2 of those teams dropped out within 2 years the number of clubs in the top flight has varied from the initial 5 to a high of 16 in 2011 in 2013 the k league split into two tiers now k league 1 and k league 2

for the first few years of the k league teams did not have a fixed home stadium that they played in because there was no standard homeaway format that we are so familiar with today instead it was operated as a national tour

the k league in the modern era has its own history but one of the most interesting events was the forced exodus of all three clubs from seoul in 1996 as part of a policy to spread the popularity of football around the country also with an eye on stadium infrastructure for the 2002 world cup two of the clubs didnt move far only just outside the city of seoul each to one of seouls satellite cities yukong elephants only halfleft because the city they moved to didnt have a stadium yet so they continued to play in seoul until a new stadium was built for a number of years the k league was without any seoul representation in 2004 after the need to find someone to fill a great big national football stadium and help pay towards it one of those relocated teams moved back to seoul becoming fc seoul



football pyramid  league format

the current system looks like this


 tier  league  notes 

 1  k league 1 12 teams 1 relegation to k league 2 1 relegation playoff with k league 2
 2  k league 2  10 teams 1 promotion to k league 1 1 promotion playoff with k league 2
 3  national league  8 teams semipro no promotionrelegation
 4  k3 league advanced  12 teams semiproamateur 2 relegations to k3 league basic 1 relegation playoff with k3 league basic 
 5  k3 league basic 11 teams semiproamateur 2 promotions to k3 league advanced 1 promotion playoff with k3 league advanced 
 6 division 5 league 6 regional leagues with 52 teams some relegation to division 6 
 7  division 6 league 26 regional leagues with 174 teams some prorel with divisions 5  7 
 8  division 7 league 160 regional leagues with 960 teams some promotion with division 6 

as you can see the naming is completely screwed up  k3 league occupies tiers 4 and 5 and division 5 is in tier 6 this is probably because the top tier k league only split in two in 2013 with the creation on k league 2 and nobodys been bothered to update their names

the national league sits stubbornly in tier 3 blocking any continuous prorel the powers that be have regularly stated that they want to reform the pyramid to have a continuous route from top to bottom at least to the bottom of k3 league within a few years but for some reason its not happening the winners of the 2006 national league season were offered promotion to the k league but they declined the offer the winners of the 2007 season were also offered promotion but declined again even though they said they would like promotion at the start of the season

one of the more recent additions to the k league bucheon fc 1995 joined from k3 league because they didnt want to pay the higher fees associated with starting out in the national league

outside of this system there is the wk league the womens top tier the wk league has been dominated by incheon red angels no connection to incheon united in recent years theres no womens champions league in asia yet but for a few years in the past the winners of the wk league played the winners of japans nadeshiko league for a little more info on the wk league see this reddit posthttpswwwredditcomrwomenssoccercommentsaqkew5southkoreasroutetotheworldcupthewkleague

also worth a mention is the separate u league for universities and colleges some of the teams from which enter into the korean fa cup the route into a pro team in korea is often direct from high school or university teams something i dont think exists in europe some high school teams are even seen as feeder teams for a particular pro team i wont pretend to understand how the system works but ill leave you with the tidbit that park jisung was first signed to a professional team from a university team almost by accident as the scout had come to see a different player but took home park instead

k league 1

k league 1 consists of 12 teams playing 38 games the format is identical to the scottish premiership  all teams play each other three times and then after the split the top 6 and bottom 6 battle it out among themselves to settle the championship and relegation spots respectively the first tie breaker for teams level on points is goals scored rather than goal difference

the top 3 places offer a chance in the afc champions league the fourth champions league spot going to the winner of the korean fa cup bottom place gets relegated to k league 2 whilst 11th place has a playoff with one of the teams that finished 2nd4th in k league 2

international context

in the current format of the afc champions league the competition is split into a west region think uae saudi arabia qatar iran and an east region the east region is dominated by three nations  korea china and japan australia who decided it wanted to be asian earlier this century has also had a bit of success

this year there will be two debutants from korea  gyeongnam fc and daegu fc its dufficult to predict how well these two will fare but if they can carry some form over to this year they could get out of the group stages at least

determining who has the strongest teams amongst the big three east asian nations is a difficult task and is hugely subjective im almost i say almost because obviously k league is best league of the opinion that theyre as close to equal as makes no difference korea has the most number of titles and the club with the most titles pohang steelers china have the highest coefficient japan has won the past two tournaments

in recent years china and japan have had a number of big star foreigner signings eg paulinho torres which are absent from the k league i believe this is due to japan having cash mainly coming from tv money and china having cash from well being china despite korea lagging financially all three nations have the same limit on foreign players three foreigners plus one from another afc country and so korean teams are still competitive due to the relative strength of their domestic players

while were on the topic of the champions league each of the big three east asian nations get 4 places total  2 or 3 to the group stages and 1 or 2 to the last qualifying playoff round before the group stages this playoff round is massively weighted in the big threes favour as they have to win just one home game when the weather is still genrally freezing cold against a team from a nation with a tropical climate i dont know of a korean club ever losing this playoff match

the afc cup is sometimes said to be the equivalent of uefas europa league but its not really comparable the afc cup is for the weaker asian nations only and korea arent allowed to enter



resources

websites  podcasts

for those of us who are linguistically challenged heres how you can follow k league in english

one of the best websites for news match previews and analysis is k league unitedhttpwwwkleagueunitedcom it covers everything  k league 1  2 fa cup transfer news national team and more it also has a podcast if youre into that sort of thing

a really good resource for uptodate breaking news is an english version of a korean news outlet the sports category of yonhap newshttpsenynacokrsportsindex for example is great although youll be getting other sports news in there such as korean baseball football appears pretty regularly also the team that works on writing the articles dont seem to work weekends

tavern of the taeguk warriorshttpwwwtaegukwarriorscom has a lot of information mainly on the korean national team and tracks the progress of koreans playing in europe but covers the domestic club scene now and then

48 shades of footballhttps48shadesblogcom is a great english language podcast following korean football

the asian gamehttpswwwtheasiangamenet is another great english language podcast that doesnt specifically follow korean football but since they cover asian football theyll sometimes have indepth coverage of the korean clubs competing in the afc champions league as well as the korean national team

for your twitter fix the korea football news korfootballnewshttpstwittercomkorfootballnews and viva la kleague kleagueno1httpstwittercomkleagueno1 twitter feeds are pretty quick with breaking news in english 

there is also the official k league websitehttpwwwkleaguecom which can be viewed in english but i think unless you live in korea its going to be painfully slow to use

then of course theres rkleague with news and discussion and where you can ask questions to the community

highlights  watching live

all highlights from k league 1 matches are uploaded fairly promptly to the spotv youtube channelhttpswwwyoutubecomuserspotv spotv is a korean sports broadcaster they also upload content from the kbo baseball and the v league volleyball so youll have to scroll down until you see something saying k1 it helps if you know how korean letters sound phonetically to understand which teams are playing but you can also see which match a video is from the crests in the thumbnail the commentary will be in korean but each video is really good quality typically about 10 minutes long

if you watch to watch live the good news is that is very easy and basically free i have no idea whether any national broadcasters or streaming services around the world have k league rights but in korea itself essentially every thing is streamed on korean online behemoth navers platform the one caveat is that live streams are region locked so to access them youll need a vpn to get a korean ip address although some other asian countries also seem to have access i wont repeat what others have already written so heres a short guide to getting it workinghttpswwwredditcomrkleaguecomments7a3zpwkleaguetipsfordummies3icantwaittoget which also covers another route via the daum online portal or theres a comment in that thread which covers a more straightforward way by using the naver tv app

e parallels and differences between yi san and the red sleeve 

1 the red sleeve focuses mainly on the love story between yi san and royal noble consort uibin seong 

yi san also focuses mainly on the love story between yi san and royal noble consort uibin seong but because it has 77 episodes it also focuses on 

 the lifelong friendship between yi san daesu and sung songyeon

 songyeons struggles as she desires to rise from just being a damo to becoming a royal artist

 the discipline and training that king yeongjo puts the young crown prince yi san

 yi sans struggles as a crown prince with political intrigues and several assassination attempts against him orchestrated by the noron faction princess hwahan and queen jungsoon 

 yi sans reign as crown prince as regent and as king his political achievements such as establishing the kyujanggjak library and the construction of hwaseong fortress 

 yi sans relationships with politicians such as hong gookyoung and confucian scholars such as jeong yagjong 17601801 

 the persecution of catholics during king jeongjos reign

 the dynamic between songyeon and crown princess later queen hyoeui  between songyeon and lady hyegyeong and between queen hyoeui and lady hyegyeong

2 crown princess later queen hyoeui yi sans wife is a major character in yi san she supports and encourages 
songyeon into becoming yi sans concubine despite the opposition of yi sans mother lady hyegyeong 

in the red sleeve queen hyoeui is not depicted at all being mentioned only twice or thrice as queen kim or simply the queen 

3 in the red sleeve queen jungsoon is depicted as being supportive of yi san whenever it suits her she is primarily in conflict with princess hwawan

in yi san queen jungsoon is depicted as leading the noron faction and princess hwahan in trying to kill yi san or to depose him as crown prince

in the red sleeve conflict arises between yi san and queen jungsoon over her brother kim guijoo he doesnt appear in the drama but is mentioned in passing 

in yi san kim guijoo appears in several episodes starting in ep 23 where hes shown as the mastermind of an assassination attempt against yi san hong gookyoung discovers the attempt and saves yi san with daesus help

4 in the the red sleeve hong deokro aka hong gookyoung is depicted as having been assigned during his childhood by king yeongjo to be yi sans tutor in yi san hong gookyoung first appears in ep 10 as a tutor with the office of the crown prince with a side business of teaching people how to pass the civil service and military exams in ep 14 he meets and talks with yi san for the first time 

5 in ep 14 of the red sleeve yi san does not go to sookchang palace to consummate relations with hong deokros young sister who has become a royal noble consort after creating trouble in the royal observatory he goes back to his quarters where he finds deukim 

in ep 52 of yi san yi san does not go to the bedchambers of royal concubine hong sister of hong gookyoung on their wedding night instead he visits songyeon in the bureau of paintings 

6 in yi san hong gookyoungs sister fakes her pregnancy and later dies hong gookyoung then blames queen hyoeui for her death and attempts to assassinate her by poison leading to his dismissal and exile 

in the red sleeve hong deokro thinks his sister was poisoned by the court ladies upon orders of queen kim and thus he begins to kidnap the court ladies and pressure them to testify against queen kim

7 in the red sleeve deukim saves yi san by decoding the symbols provided by court lady park the double rings of lady hyegyeong and the tattoo on her back she finds out that the document of truth is hidden in the irworobongdo screen behind the kings throne 

in yi san songyeon saves yisan by finding crown prince sados letter hidden in the painting 

8 both the red sleeve and yi san depict in several episodes king yeongjo as he suffers from dementia 

did king yeongjo 16941776 of joseon dynasty korea suffer dementia during the last decade of his reignhttpswwwtandfonlinecomdoiabs1010800964704x20211936079afrjournalcodenjhn20 from journal of the history of the neurosciences basic and clinical perspectives volume 30 2021  issue 4 

king yeongjo the 21st king of joseon 18th century korea reigned during the prime years of the dynasty and was its oldest king despite his many accomplishments debate surrounds his reputed display of the symptoms of dementia during the last years of his life the king showed signs of dementia after 40 years of his regency in 1762 at the age of 69 years including disorientation cognitive impairment amnestic disorder and so on

prior to his death in 1776 25 meaningful dementia symptoms were recorded in the annals across a 10year period however despite indications of dementia the joseon dynasty supported him as a king and helped him retain his dignity until the end

9 in ep 17 of the red sleeve yi san king jeongjo tells his royal bodyguard that hes dissatisfied with the way the royal guards shoot the arrow 

in yi san ep 10 king yeongjo scolds yi san for the poor performance of his royal guards and challenges him to show leadership almost half of the episode shows yi san pressuring his guards to learn how to use the bow and arrow assigning more arrows to be shot each training session his guards resent the hard training so much that one of them burns down their quarters 

f miscellaneous backgrounders 

1 in ep 7 court lady seo is stunned when sees through a peep hole that deokim is changing her clothes in the room where yi san is taking a bath we know that shes thinking that deokim and yi san had sex after deokim leaves the room she holds her by the shoulders looks at her and then looks down after turning her eyes again at deokim she asks her if everythings all righthttpsimgurcom4dgrigu 

why did court lady seo look downwards before questioning deokim well she could just simply be checking if deokim is really all right imo however court lady seo looks downwards to see if deokim has flipped her skirt a sign that she had received yi sans grace in simple terms they had sex

in ep 7 3858 mark of jang ok jung live in love a 2013 historical drama starring kim taehee and yoo ahin jang ok jung overhears two court maids gossiping about a court maid who received the kings grace the night before they say that a court maid flips her skirt as a sign that she received the kings grace

2 i am the son of crown prince sado 

in ep 45 of yi san yi san is now king jeongjo he strikes fear among the court ministers who plotted against him when upon sitting on the throne for the first time he exclaims i am the son of crown prince sado these words are supposedly recorded in the annals of the joseon dynasty 

i was disappointed when the red sleeve didnt have this iconic scene when yi san became king in ep 13 i was thus pleasantly surprised by ep 16 when yi san exclaimed these words after royal noble consort hwabin insisted to queen dowager jungsoon that since crown prince sado was a traitor deokims father was by association also a traitor 

relevant resource about crown prince sado fiction vs history crown prince sados difficult history while the throne is accurate it misses complexities of a complicated relationshiphttpskoreajoongangdailyjoinscom20190210etcfictionvshistorycrownprincesadosdifficulthistorywhilethethroneisaccurateitmissescomplexitiesofacomplicatedrelationship3059182html korean joongang daily 

3 in ep 3 when deokim wants to know if king yeongjos mood is good or bad bokyeon tells her that hes in a bad mood because he washed his ears the 2015 movie the throne starring song kangho and yoo ahin explains at the 2242 mark what it means for the king to wash his ears if he has heard ominous words he rinses out his mouth and washes his ears before going to bed in order to dispel the bad luck 

4 several scenes in the red sleeve  show king yeongjo and king jeongjo yi san wearing eyeglasses in several scenes head court lady jo also wears eyeglasses 

this is historically inaccurate because robert neff a well respected scholar on korean history says in his article ensuring to be seenhttpsmkoreatimescokrpagesarticleaspnewsidx146292 that king jeongjo yi san was the first joseon king to wear eyeglasses

king jeongjo r 17761800 who may have been the first joseon monarch to wear glasses was faced with the dilemma of choosing whether to wear his glasses in front of his council or forego them and basically be unable to read the documents before him he apparently chose to wear them 

neff also says when the american newspaperman frank carpenter had an audience with the king in december 1888 he was gently reminded that if he did not want to appear impertinent before the monarch then he should remove his spectacles as they were seen as an emblem of rank 

5 in several scenes such as in ep 2 of the red sleeve yi san uses a fan so that deokim wont recognize himhttpsimgurcomxqlkd88

if you have seen saimdang lights diaryhttpswwwredditcomrkdramacommentshfmcpwhistoricalpaintingsdepictedinsaimdanglights you will remember that in ep 11 while fighting off hwieumdangs men yigyeom stops the men from continuing to attack him by opening his fan the men recognize that yigyeom is a member of the royal family because of his fanhttpsimgurcomfmtev4v

from traditional fans do more than just help cool off during summerhttpswwwkoreanetnewsfocushonoraryreportersviewarticleid200329 koreanet the number of spokes showed the difference in class of joseon society at the time the highest number of 50 was reserved for fans of the royal family aristocrats had those with a maximum of 40 and the commoners less than that 

6 in ep 3 of the red sleeve yi san gets into trouble with king yeongjo when he and his men hunt down the tiger which has been killing people and which has gone into the palace where the court maids are having their festival this episode may have been inspired by an 1893 incident from the tiger huntershttpsmkoreatimescokrpagesarticleaspnewsidx276925 the korea times 2019 by robert neff 

some of koreas most dangerous and ferocious tigers were those that dwelt on the slopes of inwangsan just outside the seoul city walls these tigers often preyed on woodcutters and firewood merchants traveling to and from goyang city  especially at muakjae pass in 1893 at least one tiger was reported to be prowling about gyeongbok palace  probably hunting the tame little deer kept there there are even claims probably exaggerated of tigers stalking seouls gloomy unlit streets  the silence shattered by the screams of their unwary victims fighting a losing battle for their lives

7 in ep 2 of the red sleeve deokim begins working at the crown princes library there she sees a painting on the wall of a yellow cat playing with a butterfly that painting is based on the famous painting yellow cat romps with a butterfly by kim hongdo 17451806 a famous painter during the joseon dynastyhttpsimgurcomipxklvy his most famous painting is the nineteen taoist immortals 

from finding the meaning in whimsical traditional art korea joongang daily in ancient korea cats represented the age of 70 while butterflies stood for the age of 80 

8 ep 8 of the red sleeve introduces gwanghang palace a secret organization of court ladies led by head court lady jo 

from fans are angry at the red sleeve as it ruined the original novel its original romance genrehttpskbizoomcomfansareangryattheredsleeveasitruinedtheoriginalnovelitsoriginalromancegenre 

 as the series is reaching its second half when the romance between the two main characters lee san who finally realizes his love for seong deokim and decided to pursue her and seong deokim who tries to push him away even though she knows his feelings is supposed to be built up the red sleeve poured cold water on the audience by bringing out the court ladies secret organization gwanghang palace 

this detail was not even in the original novel 

the writer of the red sleeve may have based gwanghang palace on the 2007 movie shadows in the palacehttpsmyoutubecomwatchvx9wa81vbiqu directed by kim meejung the mystery thriller is a fictionalized account of gungnyeo court maids during south koreas joseon era the movie with yoon seah of sky castle in the cast won awards and garnered numerous nominations from blue dragon film awards korean film awards grand bell awards baeksang arts awards etc 

9 persimmons marinated crabs and the musin rebellion against king yeongjo 

in ep 10 of the red sleeve king yeongjo becomes outraged during the banquet when somebody served him persimmons and marinated crabs foods which he supposedly used to poison his brother king gyeongjong in his anger he tries to strike hong hyebin lady hyegyeong with a hot poker 

in 1728 the musin rebellion was launched against king yeongjo with his enemies using as their justification the alleged death by poisoning of king gyeongjong from wikipedia httpsenmwikipediaorgwikimusinrevolt

the unsuccessful seventeenday revolt took place in the third month of 1728 at that time anonymous posters appeared in jeonju and namwon claiming that king gyeongjongs death in early october 1724 was due to poisoning by the man who had become king yeongjo two men sim yuhyeon and bak migwi stole gunpowder from a magazine with the intent of blowing up the honghua and donhua gates the original fomentation of the revolt was concentrated in jeolla province during three weeks of fighting the government lost control of thirteen county seats and the rebels drew great support from people in kynggi north chungchng south chungchng and south kyngsang provinces 

10 in ep 16 of the red sleeve hong dokreo tries to convince deokim to run away with him and visit places such as namra jeju island and mount geumgang 

from wikipedia article citing 100 cultural symbols of korea by yoo myeonngjong 2008 koreans have perceived geumgansan as their muse since well before the middle ages practically every poet and artist who lived during the joseon dynasty 13921910 made a pilgrimage to mt geumgangsan 

wikipedia further describes mount geumgang mount geumgang is a 5374 feethigh mountain located in kangwondo north korea and is about 31 miles from the south korean city of sokcho in gangwondo 

from diamond mountains of north korea by roger shepherd one korea photography kumgangsan has long been a place that stirred the imaginations of many famous korean artists writers and wanderers during the goryeo dynasty 9181392 kumgangsan was seen as the ideal buddhist world which influenced indian monk ji jong sunim to cultivate his mind there in the joseon dynasty kumgangsan received acclaim by numerous kings writers artists and scholars one of those writers was kim yang su 18201882 who wrote travelogues on kumgangsan he strongly believed that kumgangsan was more beautiful than any mountain in china

from special exhibition unveils joseonera ink paintings of major korean scenic spotshttpsmenynacokrviewaen20190723009800315 yonhap news agency at a command of the artloving joseon king jeongjo in 1788 two royal court painters  kim hongdo and kim eunghwan  went on a 50day sightseeing journey that brought the duo from what is now south koreas eastern province of gangwon up to north koreas mount kumgang

in ep 34 of yi san songyeon paints different looks of mount geumgang through the various seasons as her way of getting accepted into the qing ministry of culture

11 wrong costume for queen jungsoon in the silk cocoon ceremony in ep 6 of the red sleeve 

in ep 6 queen jungsoon leads the silk cocoon ceremony notice that shes wearing a red gown but joseons court attire kdrama style part 2httpsthetalkingcupboardcom20130619joseonscourtattirekdramastylepart2 from the talking cupboard states

the queen donning a long yellow robe would encourage the women of the nation to get involved in the silk production as a mean to promote the economy of the nation

12 warming up yi sans bed

in ep 9 court lady seo tells deokim to lie down on yi sans bed so that it could be warm when yi san arrives later on she warns deokim however not to fall asleep but deokim does fall asleep and yi san finds her there

court lady seo told deokim that the temporary royal palaces heating system was broken shes referring to the furnace in the basement which is called ondol or the traditional way of heating houses during the joseon dynasty this system is still used in modernday korea for more information about this heating system thats uniquely korean surf to ondol korean home heating system an ancient heating system lasting millenniahttpswwwantiquealivecomblogsondolkoreanhomeheatingsystemhtml

context

 i dont want to move around too much so probably explore 5ish places for 57 days each
 ive already been to jeongseon  seoraksan but would love to spend more time in gangwondo probably a week maybe renting a car the whole time
 ive already been to busan but only haeundae but loved it and would like to go back
 i visited namhae and enjoyed the calm quiet vibes but probably wont go back this time
 i love hiking and nature and plan to hike hallasan in jeju spend up to a week in jeju and also potentially hike jirisan to complete the big three mountains
 i eat pretty much everything and would love to explore different regional cuisines from what i gather jeolladamdo seems like the food is amazing
 im not crazy about super touristy spots except for ones that are vetted to be worth it
 im a wellness writer so anything in that veinlike health and healing centers spas korean medicinal experiences etc would be great

 982 multaeri cheongpungmyeon jecheonsi chungcheongbukdo

jecheon cheongpungho lake chungjuho lake is a great travel destination to finish in 2023 and in order to feel cheongpungho lake properly it is recommended to take a cable car of cheongpungho lake 

the cheongpungho lake cable car can enjoy a vast view when it departs from multaeri station and reaches bibongsan station

if you take a cable car you can see sobaeksan mountain and wolaksan mountain in the distance and the stem of the namhangang river which has meandered from oksun bridge feels like an inland sea 
bibongsan station has a deck so it is good to walk leisurely and enjoy cheongpungho lake and the surrounding mountains
 bakery cafes herbal forest roads crescent moon and heart photo zones and moment capsules enrich travel it is also convenient to use wheelchairs or infant cars as it was selected as the 2020 star of korean tourism for its efforts for the underprivileged

the jegisan mountain skywalk which debuted in 2018 is 135m long with a 57m section of tempered glass overlooking the blue sea underfoot

 you have to install it at a height of 20m to show off your presence from a distance and wear additional shoes that prevent floor contamination 

thanks to the transparent floor it is confusing whether this road goes into the sea or up in the sky

 in the middle of the skywalk there is a sign saying that one wish must come true

at the end of the skywalk a work depicting a zen tomb nangja turned into a dragon in admiration of ambassador uisang is right 
if you cross the skywalk and the connected cloud bridge chulung bridge you will see hupo geongjisan lighthouse park representative lighthouses from around the world including hupo lighthouse were manufactured and installed as models and the uljin hupori neolithic museum which exhibits prehistoric life and group burial relics excavated from the top of jejeongsan mountain in 1983 also adds attractions

gangwon,foreigners who fall in love with hiking in the mountains of korea,"the mountains in downtown seoul are emerging as a popular destination for foreign tourists visiting seoul 

 the appeal of hiking in seoul which global tourists consider is its excellent accessibility and relatively low level of difficulty  

a car is essential to go hiking in downtown france such as paris but in seoul mountains of various difficulty levels are distributed in the city center and you can get there by public transportation such as subways and buses 


 the mountains in seoul are accessible by public transportations 


to date the cumulative number of people using the center is 11446 of which 5159 are foreigners and 6287 are domestic  

the proportion of foreigners has increased this year  as of the 8th of this month foreign users accounted for 484 an increase of nearly 10 from last years foreign ratio of 397


 among foreigners who visit the mountains there are especially many young people  

1151 foreign users by age 622 people were in their 20s 54 and those in their 30s 351 people were 305 with young participants in their 20s and 30s accounting for 845  by gender there were 357 male users 31 and 794 female users 69


 the nationalities of the visitors varied  

the united states had the largest number with 163 142 followed by singapore with 141 123 china with 94 82 france with 78 68 and the philippines with 50 43


inwangsan mountain 339m above sea level and bukaksan mountain 342m are famous attractions with over 730000 and 200000 visitors per year respectively 

recently due to the influence of the korean wave many foreigners visiting seoul are visiting the two mountains to enjoy the night view of seoul


 another attractive factor is that you can discover unexpectedly unfamiliar scenery in a big city  

seoul has flashy neon signs and skyscrapers but if you visit bukhansan mountain trail you will see a landscape that looks like a river and valley near bongpyeong or sokcho in gangwondo


if the kpop craze led by new jeans has captivated eyes and ears and kfoods such as hot chicken stirfried noodles have whetted the appetite expectations are growing that k mountain will lead foreign tourists to seoul  


to go to overseas tourist attractions you have to travel by car for a considerable amount of time there are few people and wild animals such as pumas live there so it can be dangerous in terms of safety accidents and response to them

on the other hand in seoul the mountain has a variety of contents such as the change of four seasons and various trekking courses and is comparable to a worldclass tourist destination in terms of accessibility and safety to the city and visitor satisfaction is also high 

if the number of foreign tourists visiting the mountains of seoul increases it will help disperse the tourist demand from myeongdong and insadong where tourists are concentrated to the outskirts and revitalize tourism and the local economy in the gangbuk region which is relatively less visited


 in response to these foreign tourists the city of seoul began constructing trails such as inwangsan mountain and bukaksan mountain  by early december lighting will be maintained around the trail and old wood stone steps fences etc will be replaced

gangwon,south korea 6 weeks itinerary  advice appreciated,"hello solo travelers

i am incredibly excited to embark on my third solo trip  to south korea
i will be in korea from september 1st to october 13th

ive crafted an extremely thourough itinerary and i would be thrilled if any of you whove traveled in south korea share your advice and experience so i can improve it 

here are the regions i plan to visit as well as the principal places ill stay in random order

 seoul day trips to dmz suwon  1 week to 10 days  probably in two stops
 gangwondo  principally for seoraksan via  gangneung might visit chuncheon sokcho  35 days
 gyeonsangbukdo gyeongju daegu  46 days
busan with jinju and jirisan national park  1 week  9 days
 jeollanamdo gwangju suncheon mokpo  5 days
 jeollabukdo jeonju  35 days
 jejudo jejusi perhaps sogwipo  57 days
ive figured out some sort of route to all these places

seoul  daegu  busan gyeongju  jeju via flight return  jinju  jirisan  suncheon  mokpo   gwangju  jeonju  seoul  gangneung sokcho seoraksan

which i can also flip

seoul  jeonju  gwangju  mokpo  jeju via ferry one way  suncheon return to yeosu from jeju  jinju jirisan  busan gyeongju  daegu  seoul  gangneung sokcho seoraksan

i could also postpone seoul and head off directly to jeonju daegu or gangneung

these routes stick to rail as much as possible and use intercity buses only as links where theyre faster

i also have some general questions

 ive come to understand september is significantly less crowded than october  and so that it would be wiser to prioritise busier places seoul busan jeju seoraksan in september have any of you travelled in these months what was your experience like

 ive read about the temple stays program have any of you tried it what was it like
is it worthwhile taking the ferry to jejudo instead of flying though less convenient it fits into my route nicely and i hate airports with a passion 

 have any of you used the intercity buses while in korea how hectic are they the routes look great on paper but id love to hear what its like on the ground

 ive noticed a lot of smaller national and provincial parks odaesan taebaek seeing as im visiting the most well known parks in the country are these worthwhile stops as well

about me
im 25 years old from israel ive a fair bit of solo travel experience under my belt from my two previous journeys  the first to new zealand 3 months australia 1 month and japan 10 days just before covid and the second last summer to italy sicilyhttpswwwredditcomrsolotravelcommentsva73v2tripreport2weeksinsicily and the mainlandhttpswwwredditcomrsolotravelcommentsw3gbn4tripreport1monthofitalianhighlights  6 weeks and francehttpsredditcomrsolotravelcommentsx1i67ptripreport6weeksinfrance 6 weeks

my principal goal in this trip just like the previous ones is to immerse myself in the places and cultures im visiting im a very slow traveller and im much more concerned with experiencing the vibe of each place i visit than seeing all the tourist attractions

i strongly prefer public transportation but am willing to rent a car if absolutely necessary

ive started learning korean about three weeks ago and im hoping i can hold a basic conversation in korean by the time i make it to seoul ive learned hangeul and read it ok
i love hiking though day hikes and overnighters are enough to satisfy me history art food everything goes photography and philosophy im currenty doing my undergrad philosophy so  

ive estimated the cost of this trip between 4900000  7650000 krw but i can comfortably spend as much as 9100000 krw if necessary this leaves me with a daily budget of 75000135000 krw

thats all i can tell you about me and my plan i know this is a lot but any and all advice comments and criticisms would be greatly appreciated

and of course ill be sure to post the full trip report here

thanks"
gangwon,how would you change my plan first trip to south korea,"places where i will stay in chronological order 

seoul  11 nights unchangeable since i have already booked an airbnb 

sokcho  2 nights

gangneung and a trip to donghae  2 nights

pohang and trips to gyeongju  3 nights

daegu and day trips to andong and haeinsa temple  4 nights

busan  4 nights

jeonju  3 nights

gwangju  3 nights 

jeju  4 nights 

seoul or incheon  1 night just to not be stressed about missing flight home 


im kinda not satisfied with this plan i wanted to visit waaay more cities like yeosu suncheon namwon etc

i gave up on them since my plan is already packed with places where im not spending as much time as i would want to ex jeju daegu busan or even seoul 

also im not sure if i picked good base city for my day trip to andong the location feels kinda awkward to be honest best scenario would be to stay in andong but i dont have a place for it 

im not sure about staying in sokcho too at first i wanted to just stay longer in gangneung and do trips to sokcho and donghae but i wanna go hiking at seoraksan so i thought that it would be smarter to stay in sokcho too

honestly im not too sure about any city in gangwon i really wanna see those cities but i feel like i should sacrifice them too and put those days in other places that are more essential like busan or jeju and just visit them next year or something

im flying to jeju from gwangju i know most people fly there from busan but i feel like this would not work for my plan since i wanna put jeju at the end of my trip 

im going to be fully travelling by public transport maybe i will rent a car at jeju for a day or two"
gangwon,coastal towns korea,hi does anyone have some recommendations for interesting coastal towns in gangwondo or on the westcoast im looking mostly for daytrips to do from seoul or maybe smth for a 2night stay i wouldnt mind traveling there for a few hours rn i have gangneung sokcho and yangyang on my list
gangwon,gangwon 1day trip itinerary,"hi me and my 3 friends uni exchange students are planning a 1 day gangwon do day trip in early jan and we are unsure how that can happen as it is our first time in korea
we plan to visit nami island and perhaps explore the province specifically the beach and nature parks but this is flexible we stay in seoul near anam station we plan to start our day at about 9am and perhaps leave by 5pm 

does anyone have any recommendations on the order and route to minimise travelling time and save cost at the same time if its possible please include the bustrain to take from each point to another and the time it will take also please let us know if theres any other things we can do there  any help is very much appreciated thank u "
gangwon,general discussionmeetup thread  week of august 03,"please use this thread as a place to chat and discuss anything you dont think is worthy of a thread of its own shoot the shit and keep it relatively civil

special thanks to ujtothelew for getting these started

gangwon,best casual cycling destinations outside of seoul,"hey everyone

my wife and i recently purchased some touring bikes for the last however many years we have been doing around 100 km or so on weekends using the seoul city bikes and finally decided to upgrade to something more personal were planning on following the seoul to busan path sometime this autumn but in the meantime im trying to figure out some cities outside of seoul that would be fun places to go and cycle around over the occasional weekend

our plan is to just toss our bikes on the earliest bus heading out towards whatever our destination would be and then bike around after arriving and just explore and soak in the sights likely would ride around 3040 km a day over 12 days

ive traveled outside of seoul a bit jeollado gangwondo jeonju nearby daejon but i cannot immediately think of some ideal locations to cycle around all day that have pretty trails and small stops  restaurants cafes and the like  along the way beyond that those are some large regions and i dont know them well enough to pin down smaller townsneighborhoods to focus on for such a trip

i cant find any good resources for the answers im seeking as most of the english resources i came across just discuss the larger wellknown and wellworn trails and bike paths so i thought id turn to the community living here and see if anyone has any suggestions theyd like to share

my wife prefers to avoid riding along larger roads and both of us would like somewhere that isnt too heavy with traffic smaller towns are fine even better would be an area where we can hop between townsneighborhoods and get some country riding in were really doing this to just get out and explore some pretty areas that wed normally not visit and combining that with riding around as the weather cools a bit sounds pretty idyllic

anyway understand this may be a bit of a specific request but if anyone out there has something that comes to mind or a place theyve gone out to for a similar experience id really appreciate the information

hope you are all doing well out there and thanks in advance"
gangwon,3 nights in gangwon,"im heading to seoul in a few weeks but want to get out of the city and explore nature for a bit im planning on renting a car and doing 3 nights in gangwon  hoping to find recommendations for what to do best moderate hikes in seoraksan mustvisit places to eat best attractions on the beach are nami island and petite france worth visiting etc plus any other insights are 3 nights enoughtoo much

for reference im a solo female traveler looking for calm laid back vibes and natural beauty thanks"
gangwon,rsoccer world tour 1  south korea  k league,"welcome to the first in what is hopefully a long series of posts where we visit as much of the world as possible details at the bottom on how to contribute if youre willing



rsoccer world tour 1  south korea  k league

 brief history
 main rivalries
 key moments of the past 10 years  final day deciders
 current season

brief history

south koreas k league is one of asias oldest professional leagues formed in 1983 club football was of course around prior to this with the first nationwide tournament having been played in 1921 although between japanese occupation and the aftermath of the korean war it wasnt always smooth sailing before 1983 the top tier was a semiprofessional league formed in 1964 which is presently effectively the 3rd and 4th divisions

the winners of the very first k league was won by koreas first professional club hallelujah fc whose purpose was promoting football and christian missionary work hallelujahs reign at the top was shortlived as they shortly after turned amateur to focus on their missionary work and embarked on a troubled history which included being driven out of town by protesting won buddhists

one of the more significant moments in the leagues history involved the stupid in my opinion decentralisation policy that forced 3 clubs out of seoul dismantling the dongdaemun derby all 3 clubs played in the same stadium one of those clubs would eventually move way down south to jeju island to become jeju united  a hugely unpopular move that earned them plenty of hate that still exists to this day another of those clubs would eventually be allowed to return to the capital to become fc seoul  also an unpopular move at the time

in recent years jeonbuk has been the dominant force rising to the top under the care of longterm manager choi kanghee who oversaw 2 champions league titles and multiple league titles some healthy financial backing probably also helped but since manager choi has left and jeonbuks best players are continually scavanged by those higher up in the global food chain it looks like the sun may be beginning to set on jeonbuks dynasty

speaking of the champions league south korea is the most successful nation in asia in terms of titles although you might not know it from some recent performances with 6 different clubs having won it pohang steelers are also the jointmost successful club having won it 3 timeshttpsiimgurcom2pc1ws2jpg

main rivalries

pohang steelers vs ulsan hyundai    the east coast derby

there are quite a few clubs on the east coast in the southern corner of the countryhttpsiimgurcomwr635kijpg but the match between pohang steelers and ulsan hyundai is the east coast derby along with the super match see below the east coast derby is one of the biggest derbies in korea and although the super match now draws bigger crowds the east coast derby goes back further

pohang have their origins way back in the 50s as a steelworkers club and ulsan are still relatively old having joined the k league soon after its founding

in the late 90s the rivalry revolved around a goalkeeper called kim byungji who i believe is still rocking a mullet to this day in a championship semifinal between the two kim scored a lastminute header to level the tie and delivered the win for ulsan in the subsequent penalty shootout shortly after kim came into conflict with ulsan over a move to europe and then transferred directly to pohang for a record fee following the transfer ulsan struggled against their rivals calling it the curse of kim byungji

in the past decade pohang have twice denied ulsan the league title on the final day of the season once taking the title for themselves once simply beating them despite not really having anything to play for beyond causing some ptsd for details on these read on below in the key moments section

this season ulsan have been fairly convincing so far and won their two games against pohang with an aggregate scoreline of 60 lets just hope the k league dont schedule ulsans last game of the season to be against pohang again or at least that ulsan will have wrapped up the title by then

fc seoul vs suwon samsung bluewings   the super match

seoul is a denselypopulated city population 10 million like all huge cities it sprawls well beyond the city boundary the seoul metropolitan area makes up 12 of the country by area but it is home to 50 of koreas population within this area are a few satellite cities which include the likes of incheon and suwon

out of the 22 teams in the top two divisions 9 are found within the seoul metropolitan area

in 1996 as part of the k leagues decentralisation policy to spread the popularity of football around the country also with an eye on stadium infrastructure for the 2002 world cup the club that would come to be known as fc seoul was forced out of seoul city settling in the satellite city of anyang it was during this period that the rivalry with suwon grew  from geographic proximity the crossing of sides by players and coaching staff results on the field and possibly some kind of lg vs samsung rivalry the respective club owners at the time

after the world cup was finished there was a great big football stadium that needed to be filled and fc seoul successfully applied to move back to seoul maphttpsiimgurcomvlbrgdyjpg fc seoul now play in the northwest of seoul

some thought that the rivalry developed with suwon would fizzle out after the move from anyang but instead it has grown and it is always the super match that boasts the highest attendances in the league

the derby is also known to suwon fans as   expedition to conquer the north seoul is less than 20 miles north of suwon and to seoul supporters as    chickencatching day some say suwons mascot looks like a chicken and also something to do with the bluewings bird thing  suwons stadium has the nickname big bird

in 2016 suwon and fc seoul were to face each other in the fa cup final and this instance was termed the super final the final was a twolegged affair in the first leg suwon won 21 at home the linked video is for the second leg in seoulhttpsyoutubeaapcrbotmnc and this return leg is the match to watch as it just has more urgency to it this one went to penalties  usually i dont enjoy a penalty shootout but this one was quite fun as it went down to the goalkeepers taking the penalties to decide it each team was down to 10 men after red cards suwon edged the victory but this final also marked the last time that suwon have beaten their rivals

referred to by fans this season as the  the miserable match due to both teams being generally terrible ironically it produced a game worthy of the name super match ending in a 33 draw with the woodwork being struck twice in the final minute of play highlightshttpsyoutubeap7grzmhxq a win over fc seoul for the first time since 2016 escaped suwon yet again although they may feel hard done by as the free kick that led to seouls equaliser was deemed not a foul by a refereeing review after the match

both teams are still pretty miserable this season both sacking their managers after lingering in the bottom half of the table fc seoul are maybe more hopeful due to the recent return of ki sungyueng after about a decade away travelling europe the next super match is this coming weekend

key moments

winning or maybe more accurately losing the league title on the final day of the season has become something of a tradition recently heres a few from the past decade

2013

heading into the final round of the 2013 season this is how the top of the table was looking

2bar2greenpohang steelers372471
3bar2limejeonbuk371262

the last fixture of the season was ulsan hyundai vs pohang steelers held in ulsan a draw would be enough to see ulsan crowned champions pohang needed a win the first half was very scrappy the second half slightly more like a normal game of football there was exactly one goal scored in this match and it was just so absolutely perfecthttpsyoutuberttj8onvk4t4m30s

leading up to the goal one of ulsans star strikers kim shinwook who had to watch the game from the stands had pulled on his ulsan shirt and slowly made his way down to the touchline to join in for the imminent celebrations pohang had a free kick and a pohang player had just kicked an opposing player in the box for no apparent reason but it went unseen by the time it was taken it was already into the 5th minute of stoppage time sheer desperation got the ball across the line  celebrations and tears in the crowd kim shinwook quietly took his shirt off again

result ulsan 01 pohang pohang win the league

2016

heading into the final round of the 2016 season this is how the top of the table was looking

teampldgfpts

1bar2greenjeonbuk377167
2bar2greenfc seoul376667
3bar2limejeju united376856

the table doesnt quite tell the full story  jeonbuk had in fact been deducted 9 points after one of their scouts had been found guilty of attempting to bribe referees in 2013 so under normal circumstances jeonbuk would have wrapped up the league title by now as an aside this was the year jeonbuk won the champions league but due to the scandal they were not entered into the 2017 edition of the cl

however the reality was that jeonbuk and seoul were level on points with jeonbuks goal stat putting them on top and the last fixture for these teams jeonbuk vs seoul at jeonbuk jeonbuk had already beaten fc seoul 3 times in the league this season and had also knocked them out in the semifinals of the champions league

arsenal legend park chuyoung came off the bench for fc seoul to score the only goal of the gamehttpsyoutube6zooll3ohbgt6m50s and once again show that you shouldnt head into the final game of the season only needing a draw this game had some other odd coincidences with the 2013 game  kim shinwook was once again on the losing team although on the field this time and fc seouls manager hwang sunhong was also pohangs manager back in 2013

result jeonbuk 01 fc seoul fc seoul win the league

2019

heading into the final round of the 2019 season this is how the top of the table was looking

teampldgfpts

1bar2greenulsan377079
2bar2greenjeonbuk377176
3bar2limefc seoul375355

final game of the season ulsan led jeonbuk by 3 points they only needed a draw against pohang to win the league however this game was so much more than that being almost an exact rematch of the final game of the 2013 season it even took place on the same day of the year  this was a chance for ulsan to put that dark day behind them or to double down on the trauma although most of the players were different in 2019 the man between the sticks for ulsan was the same at least as kim seunggyu had returned midseason after a few years in japan

what happened is that ulsan crumbled and lost 41 unfortunately for kim seunggyu he provided the mostrewatched moment of this match it is now the most famous throwin in k league history and possibly a truly unique moment one of the strangest ways to concede a goal ive ever seen in the 88th minute as ulsan were chasing an equaliser the ulsan goalkeeper takes the throwin to get the ball back in play quicklyhttpsyoutubedjkrbagf7mqt9m42s and throws it straight to an opposition player who puts it into an empty net you can see the manager entering his safe space that pretty much shut the door on ulsan and when pohang score their fourth 7 minutes into injury time you can see the goalkeeper was a broken man  
in hindsight maybe ulsans loss wasnt that unexpected pohang had already beaten ulsan twice this season prior to the game and pohang generally had a very strong end to the season

jeonbuk did their part by beating 6thplaced gangwon 10 topping the table on the tiebreaker of a single goal scored  
ulsan were now 14 years without a league title although they have come runnersup three times in that period and won a champions league title

result ulsan 14 pohang jeonbuk win the league

current season

this season is something of a repeat of the 2019 season with regards to the title race  ulsan and jeonbuk have pulled clear of the rest ulsan currently 5 points ahead of jeonbuk however ulsan still has to play jeonbuk twice and they have a history of underperforming in the important games they played jeonbuk once already earlier this season it finished 20 to jeonbuk although an early red card for ulsan did throw the game somewhat that game was ulsans only loss of the season so far

at the other end of the table its a familiar story for incheon  this is the third year in a row theyve been bottom of the table at this stage in the season but there is a feeling that this might finally be the year incheon goes down  it wasnt until round 16 that they recorded their first win of the season

one slight major oddity this season is that the relegation of sangju sangmu currently in 3rd place was already confirmed before the start of the season this season is looking to be their highest ever league finish but they can no longer use sangju stadium and will move south to the city of gimcheon from next year in the eyes of the k league they will be reforming as a brand new team and so will have to start out from the bottom again

current standings at round 19 out of a shortened 27game season

gangwon,how do northern gangwon province rok tourism demographics wildlife and the economy look like if south korea republic of korea secured the mount geumgang kumgang region,"i would like to know your opinion perspective if rok and un hadnt lost the control of mount geumgang region in the pod point of divergence alternate scenario allied came up with better strategies to withdraw 5070 of us army regiments to mt geumgang region in early december 1950 so the north korea and chinese pva dont fully occupy mt geumgang region by the end of the korean war macarthur resigned on november 15 1949 over faulty intelligence on chinese pva movement and matthew ridgway ordered some us forces to withdraw to mt geumgang region to test the assessment by impeding aggressive chinese pva advance the chinese forces unsuccessfully dislodged the us soldiers and rok soldiers at the northern section of mt geumgang for several weeks after christmas 1950 and by late january 1950 the enemy took control of mt geumgang for several months ultimately allied forces regain mt geumgang region in late spring of 1950 thanks to military technological superiority the chinese pva and north korean forces failed to capture seoul during battle of imjin river its the hotbed critical battle zone for rok to impedeprevent the relentless enemy forces recapturing mt geumgang as a bargaining chip for earlier armistice changdoup lake pyonggang imjin river at north of 38th parallel yeoncheon and kaesong remained under dprk territory after the armistice alternatively zhou enlai and peng duhuai agreed to cease the hotbed battlezone dispute of mt geumgang in late 1952 if preferable to an earlier armistice around february 1953 sygman rhee pleaded with the allied to retake gaeseong but ridgway rejected as un forces do not have sufficient supplies to retake gaeseong with the significant result of battle of mount geumgang the rok held on the coastal town of jangjon changjon

if mt geumgang region remained under rok jurisdiction late dictatorial president park chunghee until 1979 when assassinated by kim jaegyu demonstrated the construction of mt geumgang vibrant resort to attract tens of thousands of gyeonggi and seoul tourists with marvelous skiing and mountain trail possibly seoraksan might not be a popular attraction so i consider geumgang a designated national park of northernmost south korea in 1975 president park presented the grand opening of the national park of mt geumgang despite critical tension between north and south korea near the border of both gangwonkangwon province

present day

today mount geumgang np spent almost tens of millions of us dollars on touristic income like you said getting a cable car improvised the deal on geumgang near the dmz border with mount geumgang under south korean jurisdiction rather than north korean side the souths side ameliorated the road pavement with iron out the surface unfortunately in north korean side pyongyang authority forbidden north korean impoverished tourists from travelling to souths side mount kumgang thats sad news for communist north korea side

nevertheless we could imagine the korean tourists endured the journey to take a mountain trail without military interference these tourists thrilled to reach higher altitude while walking at the trail in early 2010s 201114 gangwon provincial governor implemented the project for resort houses near the river inside mt geumgang"

trivia this is based off of machine translations as theres precious little about them on the englishspeaking internet the group writes and composes their own songs and lyrics and goes for an accessible pop punk sound after their leader tried a more hardcore sound previously and it didnt catch on  the name fishing girls is lighthearted and means to catch the audience  naver is also translating the group leaders name as vienna finger but i dont think thats her stage name but it could be  they like to drink

gangwon,studying conversational korean during covid,"hey guys 

coming up on my first year of teaching in korea and its been an interesting ride i know that my life here in korea would be considerably less difficult if i could actually speak to people ttmik is great and all if you have the schedule to study which honestly sometimes i dont teaching at 3 schools 

i studied korean for about a year and some change back in the states but had to take time off because of my last job i know the alphabet and a handful of phrases random vocab and my listening is better than my speaking

now that i live here i want to get back into it because im tired of feeling like an idiot every time someone speaks to me so im looking for a tutor or language academy that can accommodate my work schedule i live out in gangwon and am willing to travel 

any suggestions how did you get better conversationally i have one solid korean friend who has volunteered to teach me but they want me to generate my own curriculum and im not sure how that would work because i dont always know what i need to be taught 

help thanks in advance"

12bar2red jeonnam dragons  38  8822  43  69  26  32  relegated to k league 2 

 fc seoul won their playoff against k league 2s busan ipark  
 seongnam fc were promoted from k league 2  
 ulsan won their champions league playoff and are in the group stages

its impossible to write a concise summary of the 2018 season  you can get some of the details from the club guide below  but one of the most interesting stories actually comes from k league 2

for context you need to understand a bit about military service for footballers rather than take 2 years out of their career to serve in the military or do some kind of eg desk job service players can join one of two military football teams that play in the k league in k league 1 there is sangju sangmu and in k league 2 there is asan mugunghwa every player in these two teams is on loan for two years from another club in the k league sangju sangu is affiliated with the normal military whilst asan mugunghwa is affiliated with the police serving in the auxilliary police force is another way to do your service

the korean government recently decided to abolish the auxilliary police force by 2023 the police however decided to already wind down their sports teams putting an immediate halt on recruiting players and disbanding the teams in 2019

now the champions of k league 2 last season were asan mugunghwa they were in line for direct promotion to k league 1 to compete in the k league you need to have at least 20 players but by the time the next season started asan would only have 14 players as the loan deals ran out the league gave asan a deadline in november to submit a recruitment plan which they failed to do and so the promotion spot passed to secondplaced seongnam fc although that deadline and hence promotion was missed asan have how submitted a recruitment plan that would see their 14 serving players be supplemented by new signings that indicates the club will transition to an cityowned club with the help of the asan government

funnily or depressingly this is not the first time police fc won k league 2 and missed out on promotion  in 2016 ansan mugunghwa were crowned champions but at the end of that year moved from ansan to asan in line with the leagues policies they were registered as a brand new club

k league 1 club guide

clubs can have up to three foreign players in their squad plus an extra one from another afc nation although rare a player with north korea citizenship is not considered foreign most of those foreign places are taken by brazilians or players from the former yugoslavia eg k league veteran dejan damjanovic the exception to the foreigner rule is the goalkeeper  korean goalkeepers in the 90s were just so bad that a block on recruiting foreign goalieshttpwwwkleagueunitedcom201703foreigngoalkeepersinfavourofhtml was put in place to help encourage development of domestic talent it seems to have worked with korean goalkeepers often being signed abroad in asia at least

there is also a requirement to have u23 players fielded and on the bench with a failure to meet this impacting the number of substitutes that can be made article 30httpswwwkleaguecomaboutcompetition of the league rules

youll notice some of the clubs have a korean chaebol in their team name and even if its not in the name they may still be owned by a corporation behind the scenes this sounds very odd if youre not familiar with it but it is extremely common in japan china and korea it may just be a symptom of some of the teams being relatively recentlyfounded and perhaps isnt that unusual these days think red bull city group majority shareholders in the west however the number of citizen clubs owned by the local city or provincial government is on the rise  gyeongnam fc is one example

a lot of clubs probably like to think they have a derby with fc seoul because well its seoul but the  biggest and probably considered the national derby is the super match  between fc seoul and suwon samsung bluewings montenegrin damjanovic known simply as dejan formerly of seoul and now playing for suwon is the top scorer in this fixture

heres the clubs by last seasons standing and since crests are a bit unstable on reddit at the moment heres an imgur album of all club crests and corresponding home kits for the 2019 seasonhttpimgurcomaw8dbla5

jeonbuk hyundai motors

jeonbuk are the dominant team in korea and one the of the teams you dont want to face in the champions league whoever you are theyve now won 4 out of the last 5 k league 1 titles and a most recent champions league title in 2016

their rise to power over the last decade has been overseen by long term manager choi kanghee choi left at the end of last season to tianjin quanjintianhai daliang yifang fc in china korea seems to have a thing for portuguese managers these days and his replacement is one jos morais morais was assistant manager to jos mourinho for a period but as manager proper hes been a bit shit he was at two clubs in 2018 which included ushering barnsley into relegation to english league one how jeonbuk will fare after choi remains to be seen

although jeonbuk cruised to the league title it would be difficult to call their season an outright success due to a horrendous 15 mins at the end of the second half in a home match against suwon in the champions league quarterfinal they turned the 3 goal deficit around in the seond leg when they travelled to suwon but went out on penalties 

gyeongnam fc

gyeongnam were only promoted from k league 2 the previous season so coming second in k league 1 is something special top scorer in the league marco played his part with 26 goals

gyeongnam will now feature in the champions league for the first time i thought that seems to have put the brakes on too many of their players departing but captain choi youngjun signed for jeonbuk in the winter transfer window a major loss is marco who was also top scorer in k league 2 in the year they were promoted who appears to have followed the money to china also off to china is key centreback park jisoo so basically the backbone of the team from defence to attack has left

ulsan hyundai

known as the horangi   the tigers  ulsan have had intermittent success in asia winning the champions league for the first and only time in 2012 in an unbeaten run

towards the end of the 2018 season ulsan were battling gyeongnam for the second spot which brings with it direct qualification to the champions league group stages rather than having a playoff they lost out but were widely expected to secure a direct qualification spot anyway when they faced daegu fc in the fa cup final ultimately they finished the season on a low losing 51 on aggregate to daegu in the final 

pohang steelers

one of the few clubs that predates the formation of the k league pohang are another of the historical korean powerhouses they hold the record for the most number of champions league title 3 but their last title came in 2009

finishing fourth in the league they were hoping that ulsan would beat daegu in the fa cup final to pass their champions league spot on down but it didnt happen

jeju united

one of the original members of the k league founded as the yukong elephants in the seoul area as part of the decentralisation program they moved to bucheon kind of and were renamed as bucheon sk the decision to move to jeju in 2006 was an abrupt one and understandably deeply unpopular with the fans teams uprooting and moving elsewhere is a bit of a catalyst for the creation of new teams in korea and the fans formed bucheon fc 1995 in the absence of bucheon sk

the reason given for the relocation was to the address the imbalance in football teams being located around seoulgyeonggido and jeju did not have a pro team at the time but there are suggestions the owners sk group wanted to cut their investment and recoup some costs

there were recent rumours that jeju would move yet again back north to yongin but who knows 

jeju had a pretty mediocre season what more can i say

suwon samsung bluewings

suwons 2018 season was a bit bonkers and especially so in their champions league run

in their champions league group in which they were drawn with eventual winners kashima antlers suwon did not manage a single home win however they had managed to get two away wins and going into the final match they still had their fate in their own hands if they could win against group leaders kashima in japan they won 10 getting three away wins and topping the group

manager seo jungwon at a time when suwon were 4th in the league resigned the day before the first leg of their champions league quarterfinal clash with jeonbuk due to fan protests jeonbuk were apparently completely bamboozled by this event and took a 30 beating at home then in the return leg in suwon jeonbuk fought back to win 30 but suwon were able to scrape through on penalties to face kashima antlers yet again in the semis

in the semifinal fixture suwon went 20 up against kashima antlers inside the first 10 minutes but went on to lose 32 in the first leg
soon after manager seo returned as suddenly as he had departed having been gone for just 6 weeks  
in the second leg suwon went a goal down in the first half but came back with 3 in the second half to be on their way to the final after 60 mins played however kashima antlers fought back to get two more goals and win 65 on aggregate and would go on to win the final if you want to relive a part of that rollercoaster night here you gohttpsyoutuberxy8pagy1aq and heres an idea of the atmosphere that nighthttpstwittercomtheafcclstatus1055055104607285248

at one point it looked like they might qualify for the champions league again for the 2019 season but suwon didnt win any of their final five league matches and dropped to 6th

manager seo left again at the end of the season and will manage japans sagan tosu recently captain kim eunsun was released from the club for drinkdriving the drama just never ends

daegu fc

prior to the world cup daegu were languishing at the bottom of the table but after the return they found some kind of consistent form helped out by world cup hero goalkeeper jo hyeonwoo they really peaked at the right time as daegu made it to the fa cup final and against the odds defeated ulsan hyundai 51 on aggregate meaning for the first time they will feature in the champions league this is no mean feat for team whose best ever finish in the top flight is 7th place if they carry over their momentum into the 2019 season the year could be one of their most successful ever they will also be playing in a new footballspecific stadium this year

gangwon fc

gangwon are a fairly midbottom team i dont really know what to say about them they did have the 2ndhighest top scorer in the 2018 season though bosnian uros deric they also had the worst colour scheme in the league last season their kit is slightly improved this season

incheon united

i always like to imagine that incheon chose their strip so that they could be the inter to fc seouls ac milan they even have a nickname nerazzurri another nickname is the durumi    the cranes

incheon spent most of the 2018 season at the very bottom of table and had the jointleakiest defence in the league they brought in norwegian manager jrn andersen midway through the season to turn their fortunes around but even after that they were on the wrong end or the biggest thrashing of the season 70 against gangwon coming into the end of the season though they were playing really nice attacking football even if they didnt always get the result at the split they were still bottom but won 4 out of 5 games to pull themselves up 3 places

it was in attack that incheon shone montenegrin stefan mugosa was their top scorer in his debut season moon seonmin with the best goal celebration in the league also put in a strong performance but has now signed for champions jeonbuk nam junjae returned in the summer to score some bangers costa rican international aguilar was also impressive but has signed for jeju in the new season

sangju sangmu

the military team where other k league players get loaned to to complete their military service their history goes far back in one sense as various military teams were playing way back to the 50s but they were founded for pro footballers to serve their time only in 1984 although they were for pro players they competed in the semipro national league until 2003 when they joined the k league based in gwangju when gwangju fc were formed they moved to sangju

sangju sangmu do not have any foreign players for obvious reasons and cannot compete in the champions league although the chances of ever finishing in a qualifying spot are fairly slim

fc seoul

fc seoul wow what happened having won the league in 2016 albeit somewhat fortuitously and always finishing in the top half if not competing for the title in the past decade nobody expected seoul to be fighting against relegation although relatively solid defensively they scored the least number of goals in the league season of all teams their star foreign players almost all left before the season started including dejan to rivals suwon and were not replaced with the same quality and for many matches seoul played with an allkorean team one bit of good news for the future is that former captain osmar will return from his loan to cezero osaka for the new season

seoul at least managed to avoid relegation by beating busan ipark over two legs in the playoff helped by a red card in the first leg surprisingly they managed to score 3 goals in the first leg in open play

seoul is probably the most popular club in korea im sure helped by the fact that it is the main club in a city of 10 million people  seoul generally has the highest game attendances although it was much reduced last season because they were so crap

starting out as luckygoldstar ie lg fc in chungcheong province the team was permitted to relocate to seoul at the start of the 90s and were renamed as lg cheetahs during the decentralisation period they moved to anyang modifying their name to anyang lg cheetahs after the world cup the team successfully negotiated a move back to seoul and did away with their cheetahs moniker taking their current name fc seoul their founding and rebirth years are both on their badge  1983 and 2004

seongnam fc

gaining direct promotion due to asan mugunghwas situation seongnam is actually the most decorated team in korea

founded in 1989 in seoul as ilhwa chunma they were forced out of seoul and settled in cheonnan for a period in 2000 they moved to seongnam a satellite city of seoul and appended the city name to the name of the club seongnams title drought started when the head of the owner company that backed seongnam died in 2012 and the board were keen to let go of the club seongnam city government took over ownership of the club for the 2014 season and they were renamed seongnam fc seongnam are now back in k league 1 after a 2 year absence

k league 2 clubs

by last seasons standings

jeonnam dragons

jeonbuks jeolla province rivals they finished the previous season on an awful losing streak and were relegated for the first time

asan mugunghwa

police fc they missed promotion despite winning k league 2 and will probably lose their police affiliation by next year

busan ipark

one of the founding members of the k league and another that effectively predates the k league busan were beaten by k league 1 opposition in the prorel playoff for the second year in a row they were the first korean team to win the asian continental title in the 80s

daejeon citizen

one of the first communitycityowned clubs in korea

gwangju fc

relegated in the 2017 season despite finishing 5th in 2018 they still got to participate in the playoffs due to asan mugunghwas situation

fc anyang

founded in 2013 finally filling the void left by the departure of fc seoul from the city

suwon fc

the other suwon team they featured in k league 1 briefly in 2016

bucheon fc 1995

formed after the departure of jeju united from the city formed in 2007 1995 refers to the year of the organising of the yukong elephant fan club including 1995 in the name is meant to show its a club for the fans or something

bucheon fc 1995 are also one half of the 032 derby with incheon united because they share the same area code 032

ansan greeners fc

formed only in 2017 theyve had two 9thposition finishes

seoul eland fc

the other seoul team their debut season was in 2015 they didnt do very well last season although it was very tight at the bottom of the table

winter transfer window activity

from a monetary point of view korea is the biggest net exporterhttpsenynacokrviewaen20190131006600315sectionsportsindex of players in asia in the transfer market this winter window was no different with what i would say were the two biggest stories involving young homegrown korean talent going abroad

the first is that of jeonbuk and national team star centreback kim minjae nicknamed the monster there were rumours of an offer from english side watford but it wasnt clear if there ever was any offer or negotiations  kim himself said he did not know of any interest from watford it doesnt really matter now  kim signed with chinese side beijing sinobo guoan and will see champions league football with them in the new season being drawn in the same group as jeonbuk

the second is hwang inbeom who has signed for mls side vancouver whitecaps hwang inbeom played in k league 2 last season with asan mugunghwa and daejeon citizen but has impressed as a midfield playmaker and is currently seen as a replacement for ki sungyueng in the national team

for a recognisable name for western readers the best i have is englishman jordon mutch who signed for gyeongnam from crystal palace resulting in this awkward photo ophttpspbstwimgcommediadzg3adzvyaakrkqformatjpgnamemedium another recognisable name is mix diskerud on loan to ulsan from man city but he joined the previous year

k league 1s top scorer marco left gyeongnam for hebei china fortune and his replacement is luc castaignos signed from sporting cp his stats in europe havent been great in recent years but he may fare better in korea

there were of course a few hundred domestic internal transfers and number of other foreign player signings  if you want the full list k league uniteds winter transfer trackerhttpwwwkleagueunitedcom2019012019kleaguewintertransfertrackerhtml has it all



history of club football in korea  establishment of the k league

association football was first introduced to korea in 1882 when british royal navy crew harboured at incheon played a game it wasnt until the 1900s that football began to take hold and the first public match was played in 1905 there was a boom in in the 1910s with a number of football clubs being formed and rivalries began to form between clubs in seoul and pyongyang

the first nationwide competition was the all joseon football tournament joseon being the name for korea at the time founded in 1921 there wasnt actually a champion crowned in 1921 as the tournament was cut short due to complaints over refereeing decisions all this was taking place during japanese occupation of korea during most of the first half of the 20th century

according to the kfahttpswebarchiveorgweb20170606162658httpkfaorkrrecordhistoryasp football was the only tonic that could relieve the the national resentment that had accumlated in the hearts as a colony under the japanese empire and was a sprout that could foster the hope of freedom a tad hyperbolic maybe

one side effect of being a japanese colony is that some korean teams were allowed to participate in the emperors cup japans fa cup and in 1935 kyungsung fc kyungsung was a name for seoul during japanese occupation won the tournament becoming the only nonjapanese team to ever do so

the all joseon football tournament ran until wwii

after wwii came korean independence and shortly thereafter the korean war there was football being played during this period continuously when possible the korean national semiprofessional football league was founded in 1964 and is the predecessor to todays tier 3 national league many of the teams during this period were works teams  employed by a company playing under the name of the company but also having a proper job in the company cha bumkun said by some to be the greatest ever asian footballer rose to fame during this period albeit mainly in the bundesliga starting his senior career at the mighty seoul trust bank fc the most astonishing statistic about cha bumkun is he only received one yellow card in his career

finally we get to the establishment of professional football with the korean super league in 1983 now named the k league initially there were only 5 teams and 2 of those teams dropped out within 2 years the number of clubs in the top flight has varied from the initial 5 to a high of 16 in 2011 in 2013 the k league split into two tiers now k league 1 and k league 2

for the first few years of the k league teams did not have a fixed home stadium that they played in because there was no standard homeaway format that we are so familiar with today instead it was operated as a national tour

the k league in the modern era has its own history but one of the most interesting events was the forced exodus of all three clubs from seoul in 1996 as part of a policy to spread the popularity of football around the country also with an eye on stadium infrastructure for the 2002 world cup two of the clubs didnt move far only just outside the city of seoul each to one of seouls satellite cities yukong elephants only halfleft because the city they moved to didnt have a stadium yet so they continued to play in seoul until a new stadium was built for a number of years the k league was without any seoul representation in 2004 after the need to find someone to fill a great big national football stadium and help pay towards it one of those relocated teams moved back to seoul becoming fc seoul



football pyramid  league format

the current system looks like this


 tier  league  notes 

 1  k league 1 12 teams 1 relegation to k league 2 1 relegation playoff with k league 2
 2  k league 2  10 teams 1 promotion to k league 1 1 promotion playoff with k league 2
 3  national league  8 teams semipro no promotionrelegation
 4  k3 league advanced  12 teams semiproamateur 2 relegations to k3 league basic 1 relegation playoff with k3 league basic 
 5  k3 league basic 11 teams semiproamateur 2 promotions to k3 league advanced 1 promotion playoff with k3 league advanced 
 6 division 5 league 6 regional leagues with 52 teams some relegation to division 6 
 7  division 6 league 26 regional leagues with 174 teams some prorel with divisions 5  7 
 8  division 7 league 160 regional leagues with 960 teams some promotion with division 6 

as you can see the naming is completely screwed up  k3 league occupies tiers 4 and 5 and division 5 is in tier 6 this is probably because the top tier k league only split in two in 2013 with the creation on k league 2 and nobodys been bothered to update their names

the national league sits stubbornly in tier 3 blocking any continuous prorel the powers that be have regularly stated that they want to reform the pyramid to have a continuous route from top to bottom at least to the bottom of k3 league within a few years but for some reason its not happening the winners of the 2006 national league season were offered promotion to the k league but they declined the offer the winners of the 2007 season were also offered promotion but declined again even though they said they would like promotion at the start of the season

one of the more recent additions to the k league bucheon fc 1995 joined from k3 league because they didnt want to pay the higher fees associated with starting out in the national league

outside of this system there is the wk league the womens top tier the wk league has been dominated by incheon red angels no connection to incheon united in recent years theres no womens champions league in asia yet but for a few years in the past the winners of the wk league played the winners of japans nadeshiko league for a little more info on the wk league see this reddit posthttpswwwredditcomrwomenssoccercommentsaqkew5southkoreasroutetotheworldcupthewkleague

also worth a mention is the separate u league for universities and colleges some of the teams from which enter into the korean fa cup the route into a pro team in korea is often direct from high school or university teams something i dont think exists in europe some high school teams are even seen as feeder teams for a particular pro team i wont pretend to understand how the system works but ill leave you with the tidbit that park jisung was first signed to a professional team from a university team almost by accident as the scout had come to see a different player but took home park instead

k league 1

k league 1 consists of 12 teams playing 38 games the format is identical to the scottish premiership  all teams play each other three times and then after the split the top 6 and bottom 6 battle it out among themselves to settle the championship and relegation spots respectively the first tie breaker for teams level on points is goals scored rather than goal difference

the top 3 places offer a chance in the afc champions league the fourth champions league spot going to the winner of the korean fa cup bottom place gets relegated to k league 2 whilst 11th place has a playoff with one of the teams that finished 2nd4th in k league 2

international context

in the current format of the afc champions league the competition is split into a west region think uae saudi arabia qatar iran and an east region the east region is dominated by three nations  korea china and japan australia who decided it wanted to be asian earlier this century has also had a bit of success

this year there will be two debutants from korea  gyeongnam fc and daegu fc its dufficult to predict how well these two will fare but if they can carry some form over to this year they could get out of the group stages at least

determining who has the strongest teams amongst the big three east asian nations is a difficult task and is hugely subjective im almost i say almost because obviously k league is best league of the opinion that theyre as close to equal as makes no difference korea has the most number of titles and the club with the most titles pohang steelers china have the highest coefficient japan has won the past two tournaments

in recent years china and japan have had a number of big star foreigner signings eg paulinho torres which are absent from the k league i believe this is due to japan having cash mainly coming from tv money and china having cash from well being china despite korea lagging financially all three nations have the same limit on foreign players three foreigners plus one from another afc country and so korean teams are still competitive due to the relative strength of their domestic players

while were on the topic of the champions league each of the big three east asian nations get 4 places total  2 or 3 to the group stages and 1 or 2 to the last qualifying playoff round before the group stages this playoff round is massively weighted in the big threes favour as they have to win just one home game when the weather is still genrally freezing cold against a team from a nation with a tropical climate i dont know of a korean club ever losing this playoff match

the afc cup is sometimes said to be the equivalent of uefas europa league but its not really comparable the afc cup is for the weaker asian nations only and korea arent allowed to enter



resources

websites  podcasts

for those of us who are linguistically challenged heres how you can follow k league in english

one of the best websites for news match previews and analysis is k league unitedhttpwwwkleagueunitedcom it covers everything  k league 1  2 fa cup transfer news national team and more it also has a podcast if youre into that sort of thing

a really good resource for uptodate breaking news is an english version of a korean news outlet the sports category of yonhap newshttpsenynacokrsportsindex for example is great although youll be getting other sports news in there such as korean baseball football appears pretty regularly also the team that works on writing the articles dont seem to work weekends

tavern of the taeguk warriorshttpwwwtaegukwarriorscom has a lot of information mainly on the korean national team and tracks the progress of koreans playing in europe but covers the domestic club scene now and then

48 shades of footballhttps48shadesblogcom is a great english language podcast following korean football

the asian gamehttpswwwtheasiangamenet is another great english language podcast that doesnt specifically follow korean football but since they cover asian football theyll sometimes have indepth coverage of the korean clubs competing in the afc champions league as well as the korean national team

for your twitter fix the korea football news korfootballnewshttpstwittercomkorfootballnews and viva la kleague kleagueno1httpstwittercomkleagueno1 twitter feeds are pretty quick with breaking news in english 

there is also the official k league websitehttpwwwkleaguecom which can be viewed in english but i think unless you live in korea its going to be painfully slow to use

then of course theres rkleague with news and discussion and where you can ask questions to the community

highlights  watching live

all highlights from k league 1 matches are uploaded fairly promptly to the spotv youtube channelhttpswwwyoutubecomuserspotv spotv is a korean sports broadcaster they also upload content from the kbo baseball and the v league volleyball so youll have to scroll down until you see something saying k1 it helps if you know how korean letters sound phonetically to understand which teams are playing but you can also see which match a video is from the crests in the thumbnail the commentary will be in korean but each video is really good quality typically about 10 minutes long

if you watch to watch live the good news is that is very easy and basically free i have no idea whether any national broadcasters or streaming services around the world have k league rights but in korea itself essentia"

gangwon,gangwon province,"was wondering if anyone had any insight on teaching with epik in gangwon i know its huge and the placements within the province themselves vary greatly mostly ruraltown placements thought if anyone who is a current teacher there has something to offer that would be great theres not alot out there in terms of research to be done on this topic and ive already read everything i could findwatched all the videos i could about it 

i know people say that first timers get put in the boonies because the current teachers all transfer to the bigger cities within the province how much does that hold up

thanks for the help"

gangwon,south koreas capital scraps testing mandate on foreigners,"this is the best tldr i could make originalhttpsabcnewsgocomhealthwirestorysouthkoreascapitalscrapstestingmandateforeigners76553271cidsocialtwitterabcn reduced by 57 im a bot

 the city will still recommend tests for foreigners employed at workplaces that are at risk of spreading infections such as bars and small factories said lee haeseon an official from the seoul metropolitan government

 the city of incheon and the provinces of gangwon south jeolla and north gyeongsang  areas that rely on lowwage migrant labor to sustain factories and farms  didn039t announce changes to their mandated tests on foreign workers

 quotthe point is that we are now recommending tests and no longer mandating themquot said lee the seoul official assuring that no foreigner worker will be fined for failing to get tested

 lone lines had snaked around designated testing stations in seoul after the city on wednesday began necessitating tests for all foreign nationals employed in the city regardless of their visa status or recent travel history

 seoul had around 240000 registered foreigners at the end of 2020 but city officials had no estimate of how many were under the test mandate

 on thursday british ambassador simon smith said his embassy told south korea039s national government the tests quotare not fair they039re not proportionate nor are they likely to be effectivequot he still advised british nationals in the area to be tested to avoid fines

gangwon,travelling around korea for 34 weeks in aprilmay any suggestions,"im travelling with a friend for 12 weeks initially well be around the seoul area northern region in general the only thing on our itinerary right now is going on the hangang cycling route and hanging around seoul talking to locals and other travellers that sort of thing 

after that i will be off on my own and i intend to go around as many less touristy areas as possible i would say i like nature so any place with national parks or mountainous areas are good the general areas im looking at are gyeonggi gangwon north chungcheong south gyeongsang south jeolla i would like to go to the larger cities too so on my list right now theres seoul daejeon daegu gyeongju gwangju and busan plus the jirisan and seoraksan national parks i might want to go hiking at some point too and am looking at either the national parks andor the mountainseaside region near busan 

which would be the best way to travel around  bus rail or both also what are couchsurfing prospects like in places outside of seoul any suggestions for itinerary id prefer places that are off the usual beaten path for tourists someone has suggested daejeon for instance and places with natural scenery im not that interested in the cultural aspect but if theres a place thats very much worth visiting id love to find out more thanks"

 the blade returns in a straight line

 the blade flies directly back towards dmon dealing 30 damage to enemies it passes through including the initial target of throw blade

backstory 

yuna lee came from a family of farmers in a small village in the gangwon province in northern south korea during a school trip to seoul when she was 16 yuna visited an arcade to her own surprise she found that she was able to easily master the fighters of the storm cabinet and on a whim decided to join an amateur tournament being held that night 

yuna easily won trumping the competition and drawing the interest of an investor who was putting a team together that was the start of yunas career in esports as she rose through the ranks eventually joining the prestigious team d known for hiring the best players in south korea 

it was with team d that she met hana song better known as dva and the two soon formed a strong friendship with yuna acting like an older sister and mentor to dva however their time in team d would not last long as yuna and hana were recruited for a secret military program known as meka the two were trained in combat and taught to pilot uniquely designed mechs designed to highlight their individual strengths 

yuna doesnt mind that hana was picked as the public image of meka she prefers to avoid the limelight focusing on her practice and a close knit group of friends

knightrider dmons mech is turned to silver steel with an armoured look and golden trims her shield becomes a kite shield and her sword a more traditional longsword she also has a banner hanging from the back of her mech

knightmare alternate colour pallet for knightrider with a black and red colour scheme

notes 
thought id try another kit for a predefined but unexplored character and settled on dmon from the new short i took inspiration from thishttpswwwredditcomroverwatchcomments99njo6somethoughtsandspeculationaboutthenewmeka post while adding my own twist to it i decided dmons mech should be based more on fighting game characters as can be seen from the very unsubtle hadouken reference id also had an idea for a while of a character who changed roles when changing weapons but hadnt really found anywhere it could work until now 

i think shes pretty balanced with her strengths and flexibility being counteracted by short range but any critique is more than welcome i gave her a mixture of sustained area damage and burst solo damage to give her more tactical choices


as always im open to suggestions or possible improvements to the character

also check out my other characters if youre interested

gangwon,korea tour card vs tmoney card,"hi ill be traveling across the country seoul gangwondo jeonju busan jeju jeonju gyeonggido with my family of four for a month we are going to rely 100 on public transport and taxis

x200b

would you recommend getting the tmoney card or the korea tour card 

x200b

tmoney card is 2500 won and korea tour card is 4000 won the key difference is that korea tour card has added benefits httpkoreatourcardkrbbsboardphpbotablecardbenefitinfobenefitmecode30num2langenhttpkoreatourcardkrbbsboardphpbotablecardbenefitinfobenefitmecode30num2langen 

x200b

the biggest pro for my family are the discounts at dutyfree malls 30 off at fantavr and 1020 discount at hanbok rentals

x200b

but are these foreigner discounts something i can get without a korea tour card    


thanks for all your help

gangwon,k league  game week 31 summary,"inspired by urojoyourboat s j league weekly roundups i wanted to do a quick coverage of south koreas top flight league

i am vastly unqualified to write this but i hope that someone better than myself will be so offended by my writeup that theyll be driven to write their own



a k league primer

the 2018 k league 1 runs from march to the end of the year the league consists of 12 teams playing 38 matches each team plays each other 3 times and after 33 games the table splits into two for a further 5 games if youre familiar with your scottish premierships this will make perfect sense otherwise it sounds ridiculous

similar to other asian leagues there is a limit to the number of foreign players allowed in each club  in the k league it is 3 foreign players plus 1 more from another asian country australia has ditched oceania for the afc so its now in asia brazilians take most of these slots

there are three afc champions league spots up for grabs south korea is in fact the most successful country in the champions league and the pohang steelers the most successful club



highlights

the k league website has high quality highlightshttpwwwkleaguecomcontentsvideo but i find that i have to wait a bit too long for the video to buffer all the way from seoul  your mileage may vary

usually highlights can be found on youtube though  see herehttpsyoutubecomwatchvtnlflfizuvg for example that shows all goals from round 31 the first few games in particular have some bangers and the last few have some awful goalkeeping



round 31 results and table

gangwon,battle the uncivil korean war 2 electric boogaloo now with a free migraine exam featuring neon seinfeild evangellion,"get ready for war battle to the floor aint got no code of honour that im fighting for uncivil warhttpsyoutubexirlifl9obot1m8s
 

 
the second korean war has erupted between the kingdom of baekje and its civil war counterpart the new korean state after failed negotiations war has erupted and now there is war once again but wait theres more
 
after a shock a coalition of russia china columia the tenasserim federation and japan not japan it turns out they kinda left an intern in the embassy and he got mistaken for an official have teamed up and have set about fighting and supporting the new korean state referred to from now on as the nks
 
 
opening phases
 
the intervening coalition had made a significant arrangement beforehand with surveillance intelligence gathering and other such acts as such they were able to use the pull of information gathering to have an advantage over baekje in terms of situational and operational awareness which in turn allowed for a more capable and destructive sead campaign to be plotted out 
 
in the weeks leading up to the intervention all involved forces reached their jump off point and awaited the order to begin operations it was at this time japan withdrew from fighting in the conflict however they elected to allow columbian air and naval assets to use japanese military ports and airbases for this conflict as such a vast naval naval air and ground force will be operating in and around the korean peninsula including a formal naval blockade no fly zone and obvious restrictions on movement in the warzone 
 
map of nks held territory inside the red outlines indicates definite positions while the red area outside is contestedhttpsiimgurcomnav0adbpng 
 

 
first strike
 
as the day was still far from dawning the attack began with a number of union state mil mi44k havoc ew tiltrotors supported by mi62u c4isr tiltrotors and several different ew module attached union state submarines approached baekje held territory and began operating in a large electronic warfare and cyber warfare attack the suddenness and brute strength of the operating plan assisted with ground level intelligence assets causing a significant amount of damage and masking the coming first strike operations 
 
the first strike began in earnest as the coalition unleashed a mass of guided missiles from naval and air units with weapons ranging from the thors hammerhttpswwwredditcomrworldpowerscomments5v19cftechfurthermissiledevelopmentaswellasemp emp cruise missile to the brahmos iv anti ship missiles along with the intervening states mass of conventional cruise missiles carefully plotted to hit vital targets the baekje naval presence feeling the worst hits as the massed brahmos anti ship missiles along with their foreign counterparts smashed their way into those baekje ships in port
 
 in the air columbian and union state air assets from the union state and from the columbian fleet assets in the chaos of the ew attack most anti air systems were unable to respond to the assets breaching baekje airspace with only a few baekje fighters making it into the air to meet the approaching force relatively unharassed the tu2000 bombers began their interdiction missions conducting large scale runway infrastructure destruction heavily damaging several major air bases and their associated hangers and maintenance infrastructure with the columbian air units conducting further seaddead operations alongside normal attack missions 
 
the ground operations of the nks and coalition began after the completion of the coalitions initial naval and air strikes with 37 russian brigade combat groups and 10 chinese field divisions spearheading an advance into baekje held territory with the nks in toe supported by local nks groups the coalition ground forces in the north pushing forward rapidly into the territory of the off guard defenders by the end of the initial assault operation a rough line through existing highways reaching as far as gangwon province with several loyalist pockets being caught in the mountains however there was also a number of localised counter attacks in the rear areas stemming from an extensive tunnel network created by the regime existing positions and batteries employed by the state also suffered from coalition close air support disrupting and suppressing artillery stations and supply depots 
 
in the incheon region a large landing by russian and columbian marines stormed the beaches in a repeat of the korean war with the coalition striking out into incheon city however further advances were stalled by the transfer of several baekje units from seoul to the incheon area with those traveling by land often being intercepted highway of death style from union state and columbian aircraft and naval assets however a large portion traveling through existing tunnel infrastructure were able to arrive in incheon and its surroundings to put up a spirited defense stalling the marines in incheon and the incheon area 
 
in daequ a large airborne assault of 3 brigades parachuted into the region with the intent to capture the airfields in the area which they were able to do so soon after the initial ew and attack securing the city and one of the airstrips the forces have been able to dig in a little as heavier equipment has been brought in through the airstrip via il77s 
 
in nks held busan another contingent of russian marines landed followed by a russian heavy brigade and a russian urban combat brigade landing not too long afterwards to support the push from busan to daequ where their vdv comrades are waiting 
all over baekje troops have been fighting nks troops to further success than against the intervening forces tallying a massive toll on themselves along with the nks these attacks were mainly carried out by the moe homeguard and maiden army while the army mainly fought against the intervening forces the result for the melee grind is a severe toll upon the maid outfit equipped moe homeguard along with the nks m especially how theyre equipped with melee weapons
 

 
other events
 
baekje during the first days of the conflict accidentally broadcasted orders to infect agents with a modified version of cholera and send them into refugee camps to try and spread the contagion to the chineese and russian publics this has spectacularly backfired and there is now not only public knowledge of the baekje regime being happily willing to use bio weapons confirmed with the infected agents being caught and put into containment but also a major cholera outbreak in baekje territory which is set out to kill a large number of people baekje agents infected with weaponised smallpox were also caught trying to infect the refugee population and as a result caught and put into containment visible only to the coalition with the failure for operational security around the bio weapons the coalition now knows the rough area where the biological weapons are being developed
 
after a few days of the no fly zone being put into effect several dozen civilian airliners took off from baekje held airports claiming to be full of civilians as per the no fly zone these were shot down however russian satellite images show no signs of any passengers 
 
a number of korean merchant ships were intercepted by the blockading fleets or submarine wolf packs upon boarding and searching it was found that all of them were carrying nuclear weapons from the north korean era with the foolish intent to fly them over the capitals of those coalition members with weather balloons before detonating them ignoring the fact that the weather balloons cant carry the weight those nuclear devices 16 that were captured were defused as they appeared to be on a time fuze while those on the ships that were sunk unknowingly holding the nukes to the submarines detonated a few days later nearly 100 miles off shore finally one ship that slipped interception exploded near hawaii as the timer mechanism failed on one of the nukes and detonated nearly destroying a nearby airliner

"
gangwon,eventthe napryazheniye initiative,"from the ministry of internal affairs 

 the napryazheniye initiative will see the expansion of several frontiers of the russian economt over the next two years notably it will finalize the natural gas and oil exportation to east asia and put it into full productivity nations of interest will be the peoples republic of china the current state of the dprk and the republic of korea by fully fleshing out russian trade with east asia the russian federation will be able to put a decline to its economic partnerships with the european union additional plans will entail advancing the arctic trade routes for ships traveling through with adding outposts to the region for emergency situations and navigation for ships traveling through 

 the beginning of the plan will see the construction of a set of pipelines in west mongolia to entail exportation to west china this set of pipelines will entail a total of three pipelines running through the region connected to natural gas and petroleum sites within siberia most notably the yamalonenets autonomus okrug where the majority of the russian federations natural gas lies these pipelines will have periodic compressor stations every 40100 miles and will travel through mongolia to the chinese city of urumqi and the provinces of gansu and ningxia this initiative will cost 3 billion dollars to complete and be one of the largest projects yet at 140 million cubic meters per year being exported on this set of pipelines mainly gansu and ningxia will be areas of export this will take one to two years

 the next part of the initiative will be constructing a pipeline extending from vladivostok to gangwon south korea this pipeline will then meet a large junction and compressor station within south korea where the pipeline will split to two pipelines servicing seoul and south jeolla the compressor and junction station will employ an estimated 1600 people the pipeline will be able to export a total of forty million cubic meters per year this project will cost another 5 billion dollars and take an estimated one to two years 

 the next project will entail the construction of outposts in the russian eez within the arctic to protect merchant ships traveling through the now opened route several outposts manned by the ministry of interior will provide emergency services of any ships using the route in addition the ministry of interior will construct an array of communication towers to provide a degree of geographic guidance to ships traveling through the area this will cost an estimated 3 billion dollars and take three years to complete due to the harshness of the north 

 we recommend that japan south korea and china all look to using the arctic route for trade as it is significantly shorter than the current suez route to europe thank you for your time"

gangwon,where to teach english by the nature in asia  how to avoid crowds and pollution,"thinking of teaching english in asiahttpswwwredditcomreslinsidercomments7asarkteachingenglishinasiahowwherewhatyouneed a lot of it is going to look like this

at least on the weekends

haeundae beach busan peak seasonhttpspreviewredditr4jykw97uu531pngwidth600formatpngautowebps48a062256d9318b054420ae271d6fa780eb7a9bc

id say most people who teach english in asia are going to end up in a big city and have to deal with crowdshttpwwweslinsidercomblogcrowdedinasia and pollutionhttpwwweslinsidercomblogpollutioninasia so think twice before you really want to go to a place like for example seoul to teachhttpswwwredditcomreslinsidercommentsimufstteachingenglishinseoulmightnotbewhatyou so you wont end up complaining about the air quality after your 2 month honeymoon is over

someone asked me this question in another tefl forum and i thought id update my answer sent in a private message and post it here

ive taught english and lived in the following places taichung tainan busan changwon shanghai and fukuoka and then since i lived in those places i also traveled around a bit in those areas especially in taiwan and also in thailand

you really have to dig if you are looking for a special place

and

i would go there and lookhttpswwwredditcomreslinsidercomments5symgfflyingtoasiatogetajobteachingenglish if you really want a location because it will increase your chances and if you are too scared to do that then i am going to call you a chicken shit

excuse the language but living abroad is different and if you cant do enough research on your own to get prepared without someone holding your hand then maybe you shouldnt be teaching abroad in the first place

yes sometimes you can get a job in a nice place with great nature online first but if its in a really desirable place then there are fewer jobs and schools often dont have to do much advertising other than word of mouth or perhaps on local sites

now

back to the topic

so youre basic choices for enjoying nature while teaching english in asia are

 be a weekend warrior living in a massive city for example seoul shanghai beijing tokyo taipei etc and visit natural places when you can lots of teachers
 find a livable but not overwhelming city for example tsingtao xiamen busan koahsiung kunming fukuoka etc or lots of teachers
 go straight to that beautiful place for example hualian hainan jeju phan thiet gangwondo okinawa you want and look for a job fewer teachers  jobs

keep in mind the scale of cities in asia is probably different than your idea a big city in their eyes is like 10 million and a small city is like a million or a bit less

i lived in taiwan for 2 years and traveled all over it

western taiwan is very urban and not super nice

taipei down to koahsiung on the west coast is not pretty imo as its mostly flat and urban and that includes cities like hsinchu miaoli taichung chiayi and tainan i mean there are a few decent places near the coast or the mountains arent that far from those places but theyre not very nice

the west coast has little surf murky water its mostly flat and covered in concrete

on the other hand

the interior and east coast of taiwan is quite nicehttpwwweslinsidercomblogthebeautifuleastcoastoftaiwan and hawaiiesque on the east coast ive thought of moving back there ilan down to kenting is awesome

the mountains in taiwan are really big too  upwards of 12000ft

its not super easy to get a job though over on the east coast though and thats really going to be the case for teaching somewhere rural in other countries most of the jobs are in the city

but if you are interested in these places i encourage you to try a little harder to get to these places than just doing a quick search for a job in that city

once you get there you get connected to the place and you can meet people and find out about jobs in hostels hotels and foreigner bars

i lived in korea for 35 years

korea is mountainous all over its not super spectacular but it can be nice i think the tallest mountains are near maybe 7000ft i grew up in new hampshire and the mountains there are comparable in looks and size

i found busan to be a decent place and not as annoying or overwhelming to the cities in taiwan that i lived taichung and tainan which were more than half the size the problem with taiwan is all the scooters they are loud and annoying and they also pollutehttpwwweslinsidercomblogpollutioninasia the air

they are fun to own and convenient though heres a pic of me on my scooter in taiwanhttpwwweslinsidercomblogmyscooterintaiwan

busan has mountains and the ocean taejongdae is nice and haeundae is alright but super crowdedhttpwwweslinsidercomblogcrowdedinasia in the summer i recently went back to busan for a visa run and it just reminded me of why i like japan hehe

jeju island  havent been but looks nice if you want the beach koreans compare it to hawaii however that may be an overstatement according to some people i see jobs posted there and i almost went there a few times for jobs but stayed in busan and then i also taught in changwon which was smaller and alright

north east south korea would also be a good place if you like nature

i lived in shanghai china for 6 months

shanghai is massive and not close to the nature its definitely not for the nature lover but one point id like to make is that shanghai is still going to be less pollutedhttpwwweslinsidercomblogpollutioninasia than some cities in china that are less than half its size so dont choose a place merely by its population

there was a nice park i frequented but shanghai is huge in china you are going to have to do your research cause thats really big and populated

hangzhou was popular cause of its west lake but other than that not very nice imo

jet epik programs and recruiters

programs like jet and epik and other public school programs in korea and japan often place teachers in rural locations but keep in mind you dont get to choose your place so its up to chance for better or worse

and rural doesnt always mean nice

private institutes allow for more freedom of getting a job teaching where you want since you dont usually have to go through a system or program to get a job

dont place your trust in any esl teacher recruiterhttpwwweslinsidercomblogeslrecruiters either they are just middle men getting paid to find teachers for schools i see too many people on reddit who are looking for the best recruiter

but

youre beating around the bush you want a good schoolhttpwwweslinsidercombloghowtofindagoodesljob not a good recruiter

last words

youre going to have to dig to find your place do your research asia is pretty urban and populated most jobs are in the cities if you really want a location then go there and look for a jobhttpwwweslinsidercomblogbenefitsofflyingtheretolookforajobteachingabroad

have some courage dont be a chicken sh dont listen to the naysayers and do your research

gangwon,2018 k league 1  round 31 summary,"i posted this on rsoccer previously but it might get more eyes here

inspired by urojoyourboat s j league weekly roundups i wanted to do a quick coverage of south koreas top flight league

i am vastly unqualified to write this though so im not sure i can keep it up as a weekly thing



a k league primer

the 2018 k league 1 runs from march to the end of the year the league consists of 12 teams playing 38 matches each team plays each other 3 times and after 33 games the table splits into two for a further 5 games if youre familiar with your scottish premierships this will make perfect sense otherwise it sounds ridiculous

similar to other asian leagues there is a limit to the number of foreign players allowed in each club  in the k league it is 3 foreign players plus 1 more from another asian country australia has ditched oceania for the afc so its now in asia brazilians take most of these slots

there are three afc champions league spots up for grabs south korea is in fact the most successful country in the champions league and the pohang steelers the most successful club



highlights

the k league website has high quality highlightshttpwwwkleaguecomcontentsvideo but i find that i have to wait a bit too long for the video to buffer all the way from seoul  your mileage may vary

usually highlights can be found on youtube though  see herehttpsyoutubecomwatchvtnlflfizuvg for example that shows all goals from round 31 the first few games in particular have some bangers and the last few have some awful goalkeeping

ive also had a recommendation of the spotv yt channelhttpsmyoutubecomuserspotv for full highlights and it looks good it helps if you can read a bit of  to navigate but if not just scroll down to where it says 2018 k1 and work out which teams it is from the badges



round 31 results and table

homescore  away
    
suwon samsung bluewings  22  ulsan hyundai
jeonbuk hyundai motors  32  gangwon fc
jeju united  10  jeonnam dragons
fc seoul  22  sangju sangmu
pohang steelers  21  daegu fc
incheon united  22  gyeongnam fc

suwon could only manage a draw just with 3rdplaced ulsan meaning champions league qualification becomes even less likely fc seouls miserable season continues as they too can only draw at home against military team sangju sangmu bottomplaced incheon pull off an impressive draw against 2ndplaced gyeongnam and in doing so inch reigning champions jeonbuk towards an inevitable successful defence of the title 

typing out the table will take forever so just view it here for examplehttpsenwikipediaorgwiki2018kleague1leaguetable or your website of choice



the week ahead

edit match previewhttpwwwtheafccomcompetitionsafcchampionsleaguelatestnewssemifinal1stlegpreviewkashimaantlersvssuwonsamsungbluewings

my most anticipated event will come on 3rd october when suwon samsung bluewings travel to japan to face kashima antlers in the first leg of their champions league semifinal suwon are currently sitting in 5th place 9 points off a champions league spot they progressed to the semifinals despite losing 30 at home to league leaders jeonbuk hyundai motors in the second leg of the quarter finals kashima antlers are having a slightly better domestic season currently in 3rd place albeit 4th place has a game in hand"

chungcheong,so what was the point for james attacking jichang,as you have read the newest chapter of lookism we know that kwak jichang got kicked out of seoul by gitae and when he called james lee we also saw that he was in a middle of finishing off taesoo ma so if thats the case how did jichang met and fought with james in chungcheong and based on the distance it take 1h10min to travel from seoul to chungcheong so there is little to no time for jichang to prepare and establish his new base there so unless james taking down all the kings one at a time every few weeks or months he has no reason to attack jichang who just recently lost to gitae

chungcheong,ill tell you what the weather is like in seoul right now sept2024,"its midseptember but when does fall start in seoul


 today monday is expected to be cloudy but the high temperature during the day will soar to 33 degrees celsius and the hot weather will continue ive been turning on the air conditioner less for the past two weeks but now i think ill have to turn it on all day 


according to the korea meteorological administration the hot weather will continue with the high temperature rising to around 33 degrees celsius in the metropolitan area chungcheong area southern region and jeju island 


the lowest temperature in the morning is 2125 degrees celsius and the highest temperature during the day is 2833 degrees celsius however the tropical nights have disappeared so theres no problem sleeping at night 


why is korea in east asia so much hotter than the countries in southeast asia 

this year the pacific ocean is hotter than ever a powerful large highpressure area is dominating the pacific ocean korea which faces the pacific ocean is feeling the hot and humid air of the pacific ocean with its whole body before other countries 


think about the direction of the earths rotation 


 however japan is experiencing the worst of the earthquakes heat waves and typhoons this year



experts say it happened because of global warming and fossil fuel use airplanes are typically fossil fuelintensive machines 

however i cannot say travelers is the main reason of environmental destruction but i cannot say they are concerned about the environment right 

plus im the one who waits for tourists who have flown in for at least a few hours for as long as two hours 


what should we do"
chungcheong,the body of a teenage boy would be found on the side of a mountain strangled and beaten to death his two killers were swiftly arrested but much to everyones shock the victim seemingly rose from the dead,"on april 29 1930 a woman in yeongcheon village in south korea a woman had left her home to travel to the small mountain in the village to pick out herbs and berries however she instead found the dead body of a boy she promptly and ran into the village hysterically screaming about the corpse

since korea was under occupation during this time period the japanese police were the ones to arrive at the scene they found the body of a boy with his face beaten beyond recognition and bruised all over aside from his clothes the only items of note were a fork towel and a korean aframe they transported the body to the nearest hospital for an autopsy where the chief physician determined that the body belonged to a boy between the ages of 15  16 the time of death was 72 hours before discovery and that the cause of death was strangulationsuffocation the mangling of his face was done postmortem and the bruises to his body were a result of a beating he had suffered before death the police determined that the towel is what was used to strangle him

murders seldom ever happened in this rural korean village and even thefts were rare so because of this the police figured that solving this would be easy as due to the small population of the village they assumed identifying the victim would be easy as they just had to ask the residents missing persons in the past week and thats when they learned about the only person from the village that went missing park changsoo who went disappeared on april 26 however no one thought much of it as he would often go missing before turning up fine

park was born in either 1913 or 1914 most of his past life has been lost to history until september 1929 when he moved out of his home and instead chose to live in a small tent outside of the village while his 35yearold mother worked at either a tavern or an inn in march 1930 he joined a ground of beggars and wondered the village to hopefully get some money and food park was also described by the villages as being dimwitted but his physical prowess such as strength and speed made him a good errand boy

the body was presented to parks mother who tearfully identified it as the body of her son despite his clothes being different now that the police had the victim identified they started the murder investigation and learned that violence was involved in the last reported sighting of park back when he was alive

when park was last seen alive on april 26 he was reportedly being beaten by the innkeeper named ko okdan and another labourer named cho kijun the two were arrested soon after and were interrogated for two days straight considering the time period back then in korea the interrogation was likely ruthless and possibly physical ko denied the accusations throughout while cho finally broke down and confessed to the murder and afterwards ko finally confessed as well this is a summary of the confession that was recorded by the japanese police

the innkeeper ko was the second wife of a rich man named han baekwon who lived a village over as hans first wife was jealous and did not want ko under the same roof ko was given allowance to set up an inn in yeongcheon

ko was in her early twenties at the time and supposedly she was popular with the men when a man named lee kimun asked her to run away with him instead of declining him she asked him for time to think for whatever reason park told han and han reprimanded ko

furious ko conspired to kill park with cho they took park to the mountains at night beat him and strangled him with the towel

the japanese police sent the two to the gongju district court where they were put on trial for parks murder cho was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment while ko was given 15 years for masterminding the crime even if cho was the one mainly responsible for the killing another reason for cho receiving a lesser sentence was because he had shown remorse upon hearing the sentence ko recanted his confession and appealed his sentence to the seoul reexamination court which on september 15 1930 upheld his conviction and with that the japanese police closed the case and handed the body over to parks mother where he was given a small burial ceremony

life in the village proceeded to go on as normal after the sentencing but on october 18 that same year the villagers were alarmed to hear a shriek coming from the home of parks mother with her loudly proclaiming that there was a spirit her neighbours went over to see what was going on and much to their shock there stood park changsoo clear as day and evidently alive

after everyone calmed down park explained what happened on april 26 ko okdan and cho kijun had brought him to the side of the mountain to beat him but according to him they never tried strangling him with the towel they only opted to beat him up as a result of the beating park had temporarily fallen unconscious but soon woke up alive and still at the mountain

park however upon waking up undoubtedly thinking he had just cheated death decided to reflect on his life so far and felt unsatisfied with how things have been going so with that alongside the fact that he likely feared that ko and cho would finish the job if they saw him return decided to travel down the mountain the other way to work as a labourer in a different village before eventually making his way to seoul where he would work a series of odd jobs such as being a farmhand or a servant the last job he held during his brief attempt to start a new life was being a servant for a wealthy family however due to his low pay and the treatment by his employers he resigned on october 6 and decided that he would finally head back home to his village where he didnt even know that he was officially considered a murder victim

the japanese judiciary system and the police were both embarrassed once this came to light and all made attempts to point the finger at one another with the prosecutors blaming the police for a shoddy investigation and interrogation while the police blamed parks mother for misidentifying the body

a retrial was soon ordered against the prosecutions wishes and at trial both cho and ko stated they only confessed because the police beat and played mind games with them on june 30 1931 cho kijun was acquitted and on july 27 that same year ko okdan would be released as well both having spent nearly a year in prison for killing a boy who still lived

afterwards the two most pressing questions had to be asked

1 why did parks mother identify the body as her son

2 and more importantly who did the dead body belong to

only the first of these two questions have been answered

parks mother identified the body as her son because the police kept strongarming her and pressuring her into it at times straightup telling her that it was her sons body despite pointing out that he was wearing clothes that didnt belong to him the japanese police didnt much care for the korean population and especially not if they wasted their time or caused trouble with an old saying being the japanese police will take you if you cause mischief so it was best if parks mother told the police what they wanted to hear and gave positive identification to the body because if she continued to insist that they had the wrong boy his mother would likely have to suffer some form of consequences and besides everything else lined up with it being his body and since park was last seen being beaten she started to actually believe that it was really the body of her son

since their murder victim turned out to be alive and their two suspects were now proven innocent of parks murder the police were back at square one and reluctantly reopened the case to try and identify the body however by then it was too late all items found at the scene including the victims clothes were given to parks mother who buried them with the body and the police were unable to locate the grave meaning they couldnt exhume the body to examine it again and even if they could by then the remains would likely be skeletal and even still the korean resident registration system wasnt established back in the 30s so they couldnt check if any missing persons matching the bodies description happened recently the trial soon went killed and the body remains unidentified

ko and cho tried to seek compensation for their wrongful conviction however the courts turned them down as the police and court back then werent required to compensate the wrongfully convicted until 1933 and even then those who confessed to their crimes were not eligible to compensation even if their confession was coerced

although it is possible that park is still alive today at the age of 106  107 its safe to say that almost everyone involved in this case is now dead and even if the killer is somehow still alive today the statute of limitations on this case have passed long ago so no action would be taken against him

park enjoyed some modest fame but never sought out the limelight and just spent the rest of his life as a farmhand working with his mother at the start of this modest fame a lot of people from chungcheong province would try and get a look at him or just watch him walk down the street but he never indulged them and soon this fame faded

several theories have been suggested to explain this strange case most are long shots

the most popular theory which im sure most of you are thinking is that park was actually an impostor however this theory has been thoroughly debunked for the following reasons

1 it wasnt just his griefstricken mother who identified and was convinced that it truly was park the entire village and even the japanese police all came to the same conclusion

2 although dna wasnt yet a thing back then fingerprints still were

3 he never sought any fame and had nothing to gain from lying

4 he was able to point out some belongings that belonged to park

5 unlike most impostors in cases like this park and his mother werent well off to begin with and park was forced to work as a labourer due to his poor financial situation and thus would not be a poor choice of a person to impersonate if money was the motive and if it was like mentioned he never sought out any fame he just settled back into the village and worked as a farmhand further factoring into this is that it wasnt a very wellknown or sensational case in korea at the time either and only became one after park returned to the village

another theory is that park ko and cho were partners and all three killed this unidentified boy for whatever reason with the plan being that park would go into hiding after the murder knowing that police would likely identify him as the body while ko and cho would divert any suspicion and by the time park came out of hiding their names would be cleared and any evidence of this plot would have been lost in the meantime of course though nothing supports this theory and without a motive or identity for the victim its even harder to believe this has also been disproven due to the fact that ko and cho were last seen attacking the real park

another popular theory goes as follows

remember lee kimun he was the man ko was ready to start an affair with before park told kos wealthy husband han baekwon about it this theory states that han paid park the boy who informed him about his wifes infidelity to kill lee and mangle his face afterwards han being a wealthy man would find a comfortable place to allow park to lay low and hide while hans wife would take the fall for killing who everyone would believe to be park the major flaw in this theory however is the autopsy conducted on the victim determined him to be 15  16 while lee was a grown man

many other theories were suggested as well but they are all longshots

this is one of the strangest cases in korean history and will likely never be solved

one thing worth noting however is that its possible park couldve lived through world war 2 and the eventual liberation of korea from the japanese the korean war and maybe even saemaul undong and as mentioned its entirely possible albeit unlikely that hes still alive as a centenarian

chungcheong,why havent korean opted for a federaldecentralized government in its thousands year history,"i just feel like it would make more sense if koreans just opted for a more decentralized yet ethnically homogenous state because of how stubborn many koreans are in their nature they just cant seem to agree on anything a lot of the time 

ive travelled to korea for many years and despite their uniform language and food there seems to be pretty vast differences in terms of what each provinceregion needs for its own economic and cultural development korea has had a very long history of basically hating each others guts dating way back to the jin and gojoseon era and proto three kingdoms era heck id even argue that cultural remnants of these different kingdoms still remain in different parts of south koreachungcheong gyeongsang jeolla urban core of seoulgyeonggi etc and dont even get me started on cultural and economic differences between the north and south

in fact i think the process of decentralizing the korean provinces may be even more important if korea were to reunify in the distant future even if korea were to reunify gradually and safely theres no doubt the northern and south provinces will still have massive cultural differences and mindsets so why not give each province more control and autonomy perhaps a federal republic of  koreainstead of the republic of korea would be more conducive for a stable polity"

 fc seoul won their playoff against k league 2s busan ipark  
 seongnam fc were promoted from k league 2  
 ulsan won their champions league playoff and are in the group stages

its impossible to write a concise summary of the 2018 season  you can get some of the details from the club guide below  but one of the most interesting stories actually comes from k league 2

for context you need to understand a bit about military service for footballers rather than take 2 years out of their career to serve in the military or do some kind of eg desk job service players can join one of two military football teams that play in the k league in k league 1 there is sangju sangmu and in k league 2 there is asan mugunghwa every player in these two teams is on loan for two years from another club in the k league sangju sangu is affiliated with the normal military whilst asan mugunghwa is affiliated with the police serving in the auxilliary police force is another way to do your service

the korean government recently decided to abolish the auxilliary police force by 2023 the police however decided to already wind down their sports teams putting an immediate halt on recruiting players and disbanding the teams in 2019

now the champions of k league 2 last season were asan mugunghwa they were in line for direct promotion to k league 1 to compete in the k league you need to have at least 20 players but by the time the next season started asan would only have 14 players as the loan deals ran out the league gave asan a deadline in november to submit a recruitment plan which they failed to do and so the promotion spot passed to secondplaced seongnam fc although that deadline and hence promotion was missed asan have how submitted a recruitment plan that would see their 14 serving players be supplemented by new signings that indicates the club will transition to an cityowned club with the help of the asan government

funnily or depressingly this is not the first time police fc won k league 2 and missed out on promotion  in 2016 ansan mugunghwa were crowned champions but at the end of that year moved from ansan to asan in line with the leagues policies they were registered as a brand new club

k league 1 club guide

clubs can have up to three foreign players in their squad plus an extra one from another afc nation although rare a player with north korea citizenship is not considered foreign most of those foreign places are taken by brazilians or players from the former yugoslavia eg k league veteran dejan damjanovic the exception to the foreigner rule is the goalkeeper  korean goalkeepers in the 90s were just so bad that a block on recruiting foreign goalieshttpwwwkleagueunitedcom201703foreigngoalkeepersinfavourofhtml was put in place to help encourage development of domestic talent it seems to have worked with korean goalkeepers often being signed abroad in asia at least

there is also a requirement to have u23 players fielded and on the bench with a failure to meet this impacting the number of substitutes that can be made article 30httpswwwkleaguecomaboutcompetition of the league rules

youll notice some of the clubs have a korean chaebol in their team name and even if its not in the name they may still be owned by a corporation behind the scenes this sounds very odd if youre not familiar with it but it is extremely common in japan china and korea it may just be a symptom of some of the teams being relatively recentlyfounded and perhaps isnt that unusual these days think red bull city group majority shareholders in the west however the number of citizen clubs owned by the local city or provincial government is on the rise  gyeongnam fc is one example

a lot of clubs probably like to think they have a derby with fc seoul because well its seoul but the  biggest and probably considered the national derby is the super match  between fc seoul and suwon samsung bluewings montenegrin damjanovic known simply as dejan formerly of seoul and now playing for suwon is the top scorer in this fixture

heres the clubs by last seasons standing and since crests are a bit unstable on reddit at the moment heres an imgur album of all club crests and corresponding home kits for the 2019 seasonhttpimgurcomaw8dbla5

jeonbuk hyundai motors

jeonbuk are the dominant team in korea and one the of the teams you dont want to face in the champions league whoever you are theyve now won 4 out of the last 5 k league 1 titles and a most recent champions league title in 2016

their rise to power over the last decade has been overseen by long term manager choi kanghee choi left at the end of last season to tianjin quanjintianhai daliang yifang fc in china korea seems to have a thing for portuguese managers these days and his replacement is one jos morais morais was assistant manager to jos mourinho for a period but as manager proper hes been a bit shit he was at two clubs in 2018 which included ushering barnsley into relegation to english league one how jeonbuk will fare after choi remains to be seen

although jeonbuk cruised to the league title it would be difficult to call their season an outright success due to a horrendous 15 mins at the end of the second half in a home match against suwon in the champions league quarterfinal they turned the 3 goal deficit around in the seond leg when they travelled to suwon but went out on penalties 

gyeongnam fc

gyeongnam were only promoted from k league 2 the previous season so coming second in k league 1 is something special top scorer in the league marco played his part with 26 goals

gyeongnam will now feature in the champions league for the first time i thought that seems to have put the brakes on too many of their players departing but captain choi youngjun signed for jeonbuk in the winter transfer window a major loss is marco who was also top scorer in k league 2 in the year they were promoted who appears to have followed the money to china also off to china is key centreback park jisoo so basically the backbone of the team from defence to attack has left

ulsan hyundai

known as the horangi   the tigers  ulsan have had intermittent success in asia winning the champions league for the first and only time in 2012 in an unbeaten run

towards the end of the 2018 season ulsan were battling gyeongnam for the second spot which brings with it direct qualification to the champions league group stages rather than having a playoff they lost out but were widely expected to secure a direct qualification spot anyway when they faced daegu fc in the fa cup final ultimately they finished the season on a low losing 51 on aggregate to daegu in the final 

pohang steelers

one of the few clubs that predates the formation of the k league pohang are another of the historical korean powerhouses they hold the record for the most number of champions league title 3 but their last title came in 2009

finishing fourth in the league they were hoping that ulsan would beat daegu in the fa cup final to pass their champions league spot on down but it didnt happen

jeju united

one of the original members of the k league founded as the yukong elephants in the seoul area as part of the decentralisation program they moved to bucheon kind of and were renamed as bucheon sk the decision to move to jeju in 2006 was an abrupt one and understandably deeply unpopular with the fans teams uprooting and moving elsewhere is a bit of a catalyst for the creation of new teams in korea and the fans formed bucheon fc 1995 in the absence of bucheon sk

the reason given for the relocation was to the address the imbalance in football teams being located around seoulgyeonggido and jeju did not have a pro team at the time but there are suggestions the owners sk group wanted to cut their investment and recoup some costs

there were recent rumours that jeju would move yet again back north to yongin but who knows 

jeju had a pretty mediocre season what more can i say

suwon samsung bluewings

suwons 2018 season was a bit bonkers and especially so in their champions league run

in their champions league group in which they were drawn with eventual winners kashima antlers suwon did not manage a single home win however they had managed to get two away wins and going into the final match they still had their fate in their own hands if they could win against group leaders kashima in japan they won 10 getting three away wins and topping the group

manager seo jungwon at a time when suwon were 4th in the league resigned the day before the first leg of their champions league quarterfinal clash with jeonbuk due to fan protests jeonbuk were apparently completely bamboozled by this event and took a 30 beating at home then in the return leg in suwon jeonbuk fought back to win 30 but suwon were able to scrape through on penalties to face kashima antlers yet again in the semis

in the semifinal fixture suwon went 20 up against kashima antlers inside the first 10 minutes but went on to lose 32 in the first leg
soon after manager seo returned as suddenly as he had departed having been gone for just 6 weeks  
in the second leg suwon went a goal down in the first half but came back with 3 in the second half to be on their way to the final after 60 mins played however kashima antlers fought back to get two more goals and win 65 on aggregate and would go on to win the final if you want to relive a part of that rollercoaster night here you gohttpsyoutuberxy8pagy1aq and heres an idea of the atmosphere that nighthttpstwittercomtheafcclstatus1055055104607285248

at one point it looked like they might qualify for the champions league again for the 2019 season but suwon didnt win any of their final five league matches and dropped to 6th

manager seo left again at the end of the season and will manage japans sagan tosu recently captain kim eunsun was released from the club for drinkdriving the drama just never ends

daegu fc

prior to the world cup daegu were languishing at the bottom of the table but after the return they found some kind of consistent form helped out by world cup hero goalkeeper jo hyeonwoo they really peaked at the right time as daegu made it to the fa cup final and against the odds defeated ulsan hyundai 51 on aggregate meaning for the first time they will feature in the champions league this is no mean feat for team whose best ever finish in the top flight is 7th place if they carry over their momentum into the 2019 season the year could be one of their most successful ever they will also be playing in a new footballspecific stadium this year

gangwon fc

gangwon are a fairly midbottom team i dont really know what to say about them they did have the 2ndhighest top scorer in the 2018 season though bosnian uros deric they also had the worst colour scheme in the league last season their kit is slightly improved this season

incheon united

i always like to imagine that incheon chose their strip so that they could be the inter to fc seouls ac milan they even have a nickname nerazzurri another nickname is the durumi    the cranes

incheon spent most of the 2018 season at the very bottom of table and had the jointleakiest defence in the league they brought in norwegian manager jrn andersen midway through the season to turn their fortunes around but even after that they were on the wrong end or the biggest thrashing of the season 70 against gangwon coming into the end of the season though they were playing really nice attacking football even if they didnt always get the result at the split they were still bottom but won 4 out of 5 games to pull themselves up 3 places

it was in attack that incheon shone montenegrin stefan mugosa was their top scorer in his debut season moon seonmin with the best goal celebration in the league also put in a strong performance but has now signed for champions jeonbuk nam junjae returned in the summer to score some bangers costa rican international aguilar was also impressive but has signed for jeju in the new season

sangju sangmu

the military team where other k league players get loaned to to complete their military service their history goes far back in one sense as various military teams were playing way back to the 50s but they were founded for pro footballers to serve their time only in 1984 although they were for pro players they competed in the semipro national league until 2003 when they joined the k league based in gwangju when gwangju fc were formed they moved to sangju

sangju sangmu do not have any foreign players for obvious reasons and cannot compete in the champions league although the chances of ever finishing in a qualifying spot are fairly slim

fc seoul

fc seoul wow what happened having won the league in 2016 albeit somewhat fortuitously and always finishing in the top half if not competing for the title in the past decade nobody expected seoul to be fighting against relegation although relatively solid defensively they scored the least number of goals in the league season of all teams their star foreign players almost all left before the season started including dejan to rivals suwon and were not replaced with the same quality and for many matches seoul played with an allkorean team one bit of good news for the future is that former captain osmar will return from his loan to cezero osaka for the new season

seoul at least managed to avoid relegation by beating busan ipark over two legs in the playoff helped by a red card in the first leg surprisingly they managed to score 3 goals in the first leg in open play

seoul is probably the most popular club in korea im sure helped by the fact that it is the main club in a city of 10 million people  seoul generally has the highest game attendances although it was much reduced last season because they were so crap

starting out as luckygoldstar ie lg fc in chungcheong province the team was permitted to relocate to seoul at the start of the 90s and were renamed as lg cheetahs during the decentralisation period they moved to anyang modifying their name to anyang lg cheetahs after the world cup the team successfully negotiated a move back to seoul and did away with their cheetahs moniker taking their current name fc seoul their founding and rebirth years are both on their badge  1983 and 2004

seongnam fc

gaining direct promotion due to asan mugunghwas situation seongnam is actually the most decorated team in korea

founded in 1989 in seoul as ilhwa chunma they were forced out of seoul and settled in cheonnan for a period in 2000 they moved to seongnam a satellite city of seoul and appended the city name to the name of the club seongnams title drought started when the head of the owner company that backed seongnam died in 2012 and the board were keen to let go of the club seongnam city government took over ownership of the club for the 2014 season and they were renamed seongnam fc seongnam are now back in k league 1 after a 2 year absence

k league 2 clubs

by last seasons standings

jeonnam dragons

jeonbuks jeolla province rivals they finished the previous season on an awful losing streak and were relegated for the first time

asan mugunghwa

police fc they missed promotion despite winning k league 2 and will probably lose their police affiliation by next year

busan ipark

one of the founding members of the k league and another that effectively predates the k league busan were beaten by k league 1 opposition in the prorel playoff for the second year in a row they were the first korean team to win the asian continental title in the 80s

daejeon citizen

one of the first communitycityowned clubs in korea

gwangju fc

relegated in the 2017 season despite finishing 5th in 2018 they still got to participate in the playoffs due to asan mugunghwas situation

fc anyang

founded in 2013 finally filling the void left by the departure of fc seoul from the city

suwon fc

the other suwon team they featured in k league 1 briefly in 2016

bucheon fc 1995

formed after the departure of jeju united from the city formed in 2007 1995 refers to the year of the organising of the yukong elephant fan club including 1995 in the name is meant to show its a club for the fans or something

bucheon fc 1995 are also one half of the 032 derby with incheon united because they share the same area code 032

ansan greeners fc

formed only in 2017 theyve had two 9thposition finishes

seoul eland fc

the other seoul team their debut season was in 2015 they didnt do very well last season although it was very tight at the bottom of the table

winter transfer window activity

from a monetary point of view korea is the biggest net exporterhttpsenynacokrviewaen20190131006600315sectionsportsindex of players in asia in the transfer market this winter window was no different with what i would say were the two biggest stories involving young homegrown korean talent going abroad

the first is that of jeonbuk and national team star centreback kim minjae nicknamed the monster there were rumours of an offer from english side watford but it wasnt clear if there ever was any offer or negotiations  kim himself said he did not know of any interest from watford it doesnt really matter now  kim signed with chinese side beijing sinobo guoan and will see champions league football with them in the new season being drawn in the same group as jeonbuk

the second is hwang inbeom who has signed for mls side vancouver whitecaps hwang inbeom played in k league 2 last season with asan mugunghwa and daejeon citizen but has impressed as a midfield playmaker and is currently seen as a replacement for ki sungyueng in the national team

for a recognisable name for western readers the best i have is englishman jordon mutch who signed for gyeongnam from crystal palace resulting in this awkward photo ophttpspbstwimgcommediadzg3adzvyaakrkqformatjpgnamemedium another recognisable name is mix diskerud on loan to ulsan from man city but he joined the previous year

k league 1s top scorer marco left gyeongnam for hebei china fortune and his replacement is luc castaignos signed from sporting cp his stats in europe havent been great in recent years but he may fare better in korea

there were of course a few hundred domestic internal transfers and number of other foreign player signings  if you want the full list k league uniteds winter transfer trackerhttpwwwkleagueunitedcom2019012019kleaguewintertransfertrackerhtml has it all



history of club football in korea  establishment of the k league

association football was first introduced to korea in 1882 when british royal navy crew harboured at incheon played a game it wasnt until the 1900s that football began to take hold and the first public match was played in 1905 there was a boom in in the 1910s with a number of football clubs being formed and rivalries began to form between clubs in seoul and pyongyang

the first nationwide competition was the all joseon football tournament joseon being the name for korea at the time founded in 1921 there wasnt actually a champion crowned in 1921 as the tournament was cut short due to complaints over refereeing decisions all this was taking place during japanese occupation of korea during most of the first half of the 20th century

according to the kfahttpswebarchiveorgweb20170606162658httpkfaorkrrecordhistoryasp football was the only tonic that could relieve the the national resentment that had accumlated in the hearts as a colony under the japanese empire and was a sprout that could foster the hope of freedom a tad hyperbolic maybe

one side effect of being a japanese colony is that some korean teams were allowed to participate in the emperors cup japans fa cup and in 1935 kyungsung fc kyungsung was a name for seoul during japanese occupation won the tournament becoming the only nonjapanese team to ever do so

the all joseon football tournament ran until wwii

after wwii came korean independence and shortly thereafter the korean war there was football being played during this period continuously when possible the korean national semiprofessional football league was founded in 1964 and is the predecessor to todays tier 3 national league many of the teams during this period were works teams  employed by a company playing under the name of the company but also having a proper job in the company cha bumkun said by some to be the greatest ever asian footballer rose to fame during this period albeit mainly in the bundesliga starting his senior career at the mighty seoul trust bank fc the most astonishing statistic about cha bumkun is he only received one yellow card in his career

finally we get to the establishment of professional football with the korean super league in 1983 now named the k league initially there were only 5 teams and 2 of those teams dropped out within 2 years the number of clubs in the top flight has varied from the initial 5 to a high of 16 in 2011 in 2013 the k league split into two tiers now k league 1 and k league 2

for the first few years of the k league teams did not have a fixed home stadium that they played in because there was no standard homeaway format that we are so familiar with today instead it was operated as a national tour

the k league in the modern era has its own history but one of the most interesting events was the forced exodus of all three clubs from seoul in 1996 as part of a policy to spread the popularity of football around the country also with an eye on stadium infrastructure for the 2002 world cup two of the clubs didnt move far only just outside the city of seoul each to one of seouls satellite cities yukong elephants only halfleft because the city they moved to didnt have a stadium yet so they continued to play in seoul until a new stadium was built for a number of years the k league was without any seoul representation in 2004 after the need to find someone to fill a great big national football stadium and help pay towards it one of those relocated teams moved back to seoul becoming fc seoul



football pyramid  league format

the current system looks like this


 tier  league  notes 

 1  k league 1 12 teams 1 relegation to k league 2 1 relegation playoff with k league 2
 2  k league 2  10 teams 1 promotion to k league 1 1 promotion playoff with k league 2
 3  national league  8 teams semipro no promotionrelegation
 4  k3 league advanced  12 teams semiproamateur 2 relegations to k3 league basic 1 relegation playoff with k3 league basic 
 5  k3 league basic 11 teams semiproamateur 2 promotions to k3 league advanced 1 promotion playoff with k3 league advanced 
 6 division 5 league 6 regional leagues with 52 teams some relegation to division 6 
 7  division 6 league 26 regional leagues with 174 teams some prorel with divisions 5  7 
 8  division 7 league 160 regional leagues with 960 teams some promotion with division 6 

as you can see the naming is completely screwed up  k3 league occupies tiers 4 and 5 and division 5 is in tier 6 this is probably because the top tier k league only split in two in 2013 with the creation on k league 2 and nobodys been bothered to update their names

the national league sits stubbornly in tier 3 blocking any continuous prorel the powers that be have regularly stated that they want to reform the pyramid to have a continuous route from top to bottom at least to the bottom of k3 league within a few years but for some reason its not happening the winners of the 2006 national league season were offered promotion to the k league but they declined the offer the winners of the 2007 season were also offered promotion but declined again even though they said they would like promotion at the start of the season

one of the more recent additions to the k league bucheon fc 1995 joined from k3 league because they didnt want to pay the higher fees associated with starting out in the national league

outside of this system there is the wk league the womens top tier the wk league has been dominated by incheon red angels no connection to incheon united in recent years theres no womens champions league in asia yet but for a few years in the past the winners of the wk league played the winners of japans nadeshiko league for a little more info on the wk league see this reddit posthttpswwwredditcomrwomenssoccercommentsaqkew5southkoreasroutetotheworldcupthewkleague

also worth a mention is the separate u league for universities and colleges some of the teams from which enter into the korean fa cup the route into a pro team in korea is often direct from high school or university teams something i dont think exists in europe some high school teams are even seen as feeder teams for a particular pro team i wont pretend to understand how the system works but ill leave you with the tidbit that park jisung was first signed to a professional team from a university team almost by accident as the scout had come to see a different player but took home park instead

k league 1

k league 1 consists of 12 teams playing 38 games the format is identical to the scottish premiership  all teams play each other three times and then after the split the top 6 and bottom 6 battle it out among themselves to settle the championship and relegation spots respectively the first tie breaker for teams level on points is goals scored rather than goal difference

the top 3 places offer a chance in the afc champions league the fourth champions league spot going to the winner of the korean fa cup bottom place gets relegated to k league 2 whilst 11th place has a playoff with one of the teams that finished 2nd4th in k league 2

international context

in the current format of the afc champions league the competition is split into a west region think uae saudi arabia qatar iran and an east region the east region is dominated by three nations  korea china and japan australia who decided it wanted to be asian earlier this century has also had a bit of success

this year there will be two debutants from korea  gyeongnam fc and daegu fc its dufficult to predict how well these two will fare but if they can carry some form over to this year they could get out of the group stages at least

determining who has the strongest teams amongst the big three east asian nations is a difficult task and is hugely subjective im almost i say almost because obviously k league is best league of the opinion that theyre as close to equal as makes no difference korea has the most number of titles and the club with the most titles pohang steelers china have the highest coefficient japan has won the past two tournaments

in recent years china and japan have had a number of big star foreigner signings eg paulinho torres which are absent from the k league i believe this is due to japan having cash mainly coming from tv money and china having cash from well being china despite korea lagging financially all three nations have the same limit on foreign players three foreigners plus one from another afc country and so korean teams are still competitive due to the relative strength of their domestic players

while were on the topic of the champions league each of the big three east asian nations get 4 places total  2 or 3 to the group stages and 1 or 2 to the last qualifying playoff round before the group stages this playoff round is massively weighted in the big threes favour as they have to win just one home game when the weather is still genrally freezing cold against a team from a nation with a tropical climate i dont know of a korean club ever losing this playoff match

the afc cup is sometimes said to be the equivalent of uefas europa league but its not really comparable the afc cup is for the weaker asian nations only and korea arent allowed to enter



resources

websites  podcasts

for those of us who are linguistically challenged heres how you can follow k league in english

one of the best websites for news match previews and analysis is k league unitedhttpwwwkleagueunitedcom it covers everything  k league 1  2 fa cup transfer news national team and more it also has a podcast if youre into that sort of thing

a really good resource for uptodate breaking news is an english version of a korean news outlet the sports category of yonhap newshttpsenynacokrsportsindex for example is great although youll be getting other sports news in there such as korean baseball football appears pretty regularly also the team that works on writing the articles dont seem to work weekends

tavern of the taeguk warriorshttpwwwtaegukwarriorscom has a lot of information mainly on the korean national team and tracks the progress of koreans playing in europe but covers the domestic club scene now and then

48 shades of footballhttps48shadesblogcom is a great english language podcast following korean football

the asian gamehttpswwwtheasiangamenet is another great english language podcast that doesnt specifically follow korean football but since they cover asian football theyll sometimes have indepth coverage of the korean clubs competing in the afc champions league as well as the korean national team

for your twitter fix the korea football news korfootballnewshttpstwittercomkorfootballnews and viva la kleague kleagueno1httpstwittercomkleagueno1 twitter feeds are pretty quick with breaking news in english 

there is also the official k league websitehttpwwwkleaguecom which can be viewed in english but i think unless you live in korea its going to be painfully slow to use

then of course theres rkleague with news and discussion and where you can ask questions to the community

highlights  watching live

all highlights from k league 1 matches are uploaded fairly promptly to the spotv youtube channelhttpswwwyoutubecomuserspotv spotv is a korean sports broadcaster they also upload content from the kbo baseball and the v league volleyball so youll have to scroll down until you see something saying k1 it helps if you know how korean letters sound phonetically to understand which teams are playing but you can also see which match a video is from the crests in the thumbnail the commentary will be in korean but each video is really good quality typically about 10 minutes long

if you watch to watch live the good news is that is very easy and basically free i have no idea whether any national broadcasters or streaming services around the world have k league rights but in korea itself essentially every thing is streamed on korean online behemoth navers platform the one caveat is that live streams are region locked so to access them youll need a vpn to get a korean ip address although some other asian countries also seem to have access i wont repeat what others have already written so heres a short guide to getting it workinghttpswwwredditcomrkleaguecomments7a3zpwkleaguetipsfordummies3icantwaittoget which also covers another route via the daum online portal or theres a comment in that thread which covers a more straightforward way by using the naver tv app

produced in 1222 the relic is the largest among the surviving bronze bells from the late goryeo kingdom 9181392 standing at a height of 103 centimeters and weighing approximately 420 kilograms

originally enshrined at the nowgone cheongnim temple in south chungcheong province it was moved to its current location in 1850 the elevation of its cultural heritage status to a national treasure comes six decades after it was initially designated as a treasure in 1963

the bell is considered a prime masterpiece of its kind for displaying the intricacy of goryeoera craftsmanship while inheriting the technical and aesthetic traditions of the unified silla kingdom 668935 according to choi eungchon head of the cultural heritage administration cha who is also a bronze bell specialist

in addition to its aesthetic qualities the relics exceptional academic value lies in that it is engraved with clear information on the production period the location of its enshrinement as well as the name of its master craftsman  han jungseo he said during the ceremony

at its top a dynamically carved yongnyu a loop used to hang the bell takes the shape of a dragon about to soar through the air its shoulder and dangjwa the bells striking point are adorned with blooming lotus patterns another striking feature includes bands of vines encircling the bells crown and sound bow

this temple was established in 634 just a year after its neighbor before it was razed and rebuilt in 1636 following the 159298 japanese invasions of korea

similar to naeso temple gaeam houses several statedesignated treasures including the daeungjeon main buddha hall and the 18thcentury yeongsanhoe buddhist hanging scroll painting along with its original drawing

in addition to the centuriesold buddhist architecture there are plenty of showstoppers scattered across buan for nature lovers

among them perhaps the bestknown is the jikso waterfall with its roar echoing through the mountains and volcanic rock formations in byeonsanbando national park

standing at a height of 30 meters the fall earns its name jikso due to a distinctive feature  its water cascading directly into a round basin below without getting caught on any rocks

this aquatic spectacle has been the subject of a number of literary works and paintings during the 13921910 joseon era including the 18thcentury literati painter kang sehwangs scenes in buan prefecture

theres also a mythical touch to this natural wonder local legend has it that a dragon is coiled up in the pool beneath the waterfall in the past in times of drought magistrates would convene at this site to perform rain rituals

in the surrounding area visitors can marvel at the columnar jointing of volcanic rocks  a geological phenomenon where rapidly cooled lava has shaped an array of rocks resembling polygonal pillars

 buans gomso salt field is one of the few remaining natural salt production sites in korea httpspreviewreddit2h51158h4ihc1pngwidth740formatpngautowebpsa32f9fdc69bf7e290466b6155946cee6c4b1d053

after leaving the mountainous byeonsanbando national park one can encounter gomso salt field one of the few natural salt production sites left in the country

during joseon salt farming in the region relied on the jayeom method which involved boiling ocean water in kilns however in the later days of the japanese colonial rule 191045 this traditional practice gave way to the current cheonilyeom method also known as solar sea salt

the mineralrich seawater in the area lends a flavorful and mildly sweet taste to the salt that is harvested between march and october

naturally the county is renowned for its diverse array of jeotgal salted seafood dishes and even unique specialties like steamed buns seasoned with local salt

after savoring the scenery why not venture to the westernmost tip of buan which stretches into the west sea

for over a millennium the jungmakdong archaeological site had been a strategic location for maritime exchanges in east asia linking the southwestern coast of korea with japan and china

perched on a coastal cliff this place was a frequent gathering spot for traveling fishermen and merchants who held rituals to pray for safe voyages and bountiful catches notably from the three kingdoms era 57 bce668 ce through the joseon period

excavations conducted in 1992 revealed a trove of ancient artifacts used in these rites ranging from chinese porcelain and metalware to japanese vessels

even today local people involved in the fishing industry continue to perform annual rituals for grandmother gaeyang the guardian deity of the seas at the suseongdang shrine on site

for those familiar with the tale of shim cheong it may be surprising to learn of the areas possible connection to the classic korean folk story

the waters off the jungmakdong archaeological site could be where the filial daughter shim sacrificed herself to the sea god to help her blind father regain his sight at least thats what some historians at yonsei university suggest

yesterday december 4th south korean data on google maps finally switched from bitmap to vectorization it feels like its been 6 years and 8 months since april 2015 now i dont have to write a dirty old bitmap

however there is still a long way to go since it has been updated only for certain users and ipscar and walk navi system service still appears to be in closedbeta testing i dont have google maps vectorization so i have to use it as a bit map but it will be more convenient when it will be updated around january 1st next year after closedbeta testing is completely finished feel free to use google maps when you travel to south korea 

x200b

 whats more comfortable after the update

1 map data has reflected a number of different roadsexrpessways motorways and national roads and etc railroadssrt lane gangneung ktx line subway lines and etc and new towns such as vectorization updates the last update to google maps data was in april 2015
2 even if you rotate the map in any direction the letters on the map are properly aligned improving readability in the days of bitmap the letters displayed on the map were fixed northward making it very difficult to read even if you turn them in any direction making them less readable
3 supported night maps with vectorization

 whats less comfortable after the update

1 an error occurs where the administrative districts of the republic of korea do not match for example sejong special selfgoverning city is marked as yeongi county south chungcheong province or the eup and myeon areas of cheongju city north chungcheong province are marked as cheongwon county in the past
2 since the data is still used for sk telecom even after vectorization data from the closest area to north korea is not displayed so it is not directly connected to north koreas roads
3 bicycle walking or car navigation is still unavailable they are expected to be available as early as january next year as google is conducting a closed beta test
4 korean map service in japanese is unavailable there is an error in which the place name is displayed in korean all languages are available except japanese russian arabic hebrew and chinese confirmed
5  since it uses road and railroad map data from sk telecoms t map  road names are all written in korean or english so it can be inconvenient for nonenglish speaking people however the purpose of the map is not to find a road but to find a place so there might be no inconvenience"

 fc seoul won their playoff against k league 2s busan ipark  
 seongnam fc were promoted from k league 2  
 ulsan won their champions league playoff and are in the group stages

its impossible to write a concise summary of the 2018 season  you can get some of the details from the club guide below  but one of the most interesting stories actually comes from k league 2

for context you need to understand a bit about military service for footballers rather than take 2 years out of their career to serve in the military or do some kind of eg desk job service players can join one of two military football teams that play in the k league in k league 1 there is sangju sangmu and in k league 2 there is asan mugunghwa every player in these two teams is on loan for two years from another club in the k league sangju sangu is affiliated with the normal military whilst asan mugunghwa is affiliated with the police serving in the auxilliary police force is another way to do your service

the korean government recently decided to abolish the auxilliary police force by 2023 the police however decided to already wind down their sports teams putting an immediate halt on recruiting players and disbanding the teams in 2019

now the champions of k league 2 last season were asan mugunghwa they were in line for direct promotion to k league 1 to compete in the k league you need to have at least 20 players but by the time the next season started asan would only have 14 players as the loan deals ran out the league gave asan a deadline in november to submit a recruitment plan which they failed to do and so the promotion spot passed to secondplaced seongnam fc although that deadline and hence promotion was missed asan have how submitted a recruitment plan that would see their 14 serving players be supplemented by new signings that indicates the club will transition to an cityowned club with the help of the asan government

funnily or depressingly this is not the first time police fc won k league 2 and missed out on promotion  in 2016 ansan mugunghwa were crowned champions but at the end of that year moved from ansan to asan in line with the leagues policies they were registered as a brand new club

k league 1 club guide

clubs can have up to three foreign players in their squad plus an extra one from another afc nation although rare a player with north korea citizenship is not considered foreign most of those foreign places are taken by brazilians or players from the former yugoslavia eg k league veteran dejan damjanovic the exception to the foreigner rule is the goalkeeper  korean goalkeepers in the 90s were just so bad that a block on recruiting foreign goalieshttpwwwkleagueunitedcom201703foreigngoalkeepersinfavourofhtml was put in place to help encourage development of domestic talent it seems to have worked with korean goalkeepers often being signed abroad in asia at least

there is also a requirement to have u23 players fielded and on the bench with a failure to meet this impacting the number of substitutes that can be made article 30httpswwwkleaguecomaboutcompetition of the league rules

youll notice some of the clubs have a korean chaebol in their team name and even if its not in the name they may still be owned by a corporation behind the scenes this sounds very odd if youre not familiar with it but it is extremely common in japan china and korea it may just be a symptom of some of the teams being relatively recentlyfounded and perhaps isnt that unusual these days think red bull city group majority shareholders in the west however the number of citizen clubs owned by the local city or provincial government is on the rise  gyeongnam fc is one example

a lot of clubs probably like to think they have a derby with fc seoul because well its seoul but the  biggest and probably considered the national derby is the super match  between fc seoul and suwon samsung bluewings montenegrin damjanovic known simply as dejan formerly of seoul and now playing for suwon is the top scorer in this fixture

heres the clubs by last seasons standing and since crests are a bit unstable on reddit at the moment heres an imgur album of all club crests and corresponding home kits for the 2019 seasonhttpimgurcomaw8dbla5

jeonbuk hyundai motors

jeonbuk are the dominant team in korea and one the of the teams you dont want to face in the champions league whoever you are theyve now won 4 out of the last 5 k league 1 titles and a most recent champions league title in 2016

their rise to power over the last decade has been overseen by long term manager choi kanghee choi left at the end of last season to tianjin quanjintianhai daliang yifang fc in china korea seems to have a thing for portuguese managers these days and his replacement is one jos morais morais was assistant manager to jos mourinho for a period but as manager proper hes been a bit shit he was at two clubs in 2018 which included ushering barnsley into relegation to english league one how jeonbuk will fare after choi remains to be seen

although jeonbuk cruised to the league title it would be difficult to call their season an outright success due to a horrendous 15 mins at the end of the second half in a home match against suwon in the champions league quarterfinal they turned the 3 goal deficit around in the seond leg when they travelled to suwon but went out on penalties 

gyeongnam fc

gyeongnam were only promoted from k league 2 the previous season so coming second in k league 1 is something special top scorer in the league marco played his part with 26 goals

gyeongnam will now feature in the champions league for the first time i thought that seems to have put the brakes on too many of their players departing but captain choi youngjun signed for jeonbuk in the winter transfer window a major loss is marco who was also top scorer in k league 2 in the year they were promoted who appears to have followed the money to china also off to china is key centreback park jisoo so basically the backbone of the team from defence to attack has left

ulsan hyundai

known as the horangi   the tigers  ulsan have had intermittent success in asia winning the champions league for the first and only time in 2012 in an unbeaten run

towards the end of the 2018 season ulsan were battling gyeongnam for the second spot which brings with it direct qualification to the champions league group stages rather than having a playoff they lost out but were widely expected to secure a direct qualification spot anyway when they faced daegu fc in the fa cup final ultimately they finished the season on a low losing 51 on aggregate to daegu in the final 

pohang steelers

one of the few clubs that predates the formation of the k league pohang are another of the historical korean powerhouses they hold the record for the most number of champions league title 3 but their last title came in 2009

finishing fourth in the league they were hoping that ulsan would beat daegu in the fa cup final to pass their champions league spot on down but it didnt happen

jeju united

one of the original members of the k league founded as the yukong elephants in the seoul area as part of the decentralisation program they moved to bucheon kind of and were renamed as bucheon sk the decision to move to jeju in 2006 was an abrupt one and understandably deeply unpopular with the fans teams uprooting and moving elsewhere is a bit of a catalyst for the creation of new teams in korea and the fans formed bucheon fc 1995 in the absence of bucheon sk

the reason given for the relocation was to the address the imbalance in football teams being located around seoulgyeonggido and jeju did not have a pro team at the time but there are suggestions the owners sk group wanted to cut their investment and recoup some costs

there were recent rumours that jeju would move yet again back north to yongin but who knows 

jeju had a pretty mediocre season what more can i say

suwon samsung bluewings

suwons 2018 season was a bit bonkers and especially so in their champions league run

in their champions league group in which they were drawn with eventual winners kashima antlers suwon did not manage a single home win however they had managed to get two away wins and going into the final match they still had their fate in their own hands if they could win against group leaders kashima in japan they won 10 getting three away wins and topping the group

manager seo jungwon at a time when suwon were 4th in the league resigned the day before the first leg of their champions league quarterfinal clash with jeonbuk due to fan protests jeonbuk were apparently completely bamboozled by this event and took a 30 beating at home then in the return leg in suwon jeonbuk fought back to win 30 but suwon were able to scrape through on penalties to face kashima antlers yet again in the semis

in the semifinal fixture suwon went 20 up against kashima antlers inside the first 10 minutes but went on to lose 32 in the first leg
soon after manager seo returned as suddenly as he had departed having been gone for just 6 weeks  
in the second leg suwon went a goal down in the first half but came back with 3 in the second half to be on their way to the final after 60 mins played however kashima antlers fought back to get two more goals and win 65 on aggregate and would go on to win the final if you want to relive a part of that rollercoaster night here you gohttpsyoutuberxy8pagy1aq and heres an idea of the atmosphere that nighthttpstwittercomtheafcclstatus1055055104607285248

at one point it looked like they might qualify for the champions league again for the 2019 season but suwon didnt win any of their final five league matches and dropped to 6th

manager seo left again at the end of the season and will manage japans sagan tosu recently captain kim eunsun was released from the club for drinkdriving the drama just never ends

daegu fc

prior to the world cup daegu were languishing at the bottom of the table but after the return they found some kind of consistent form helped out by world cup hero goalkeeper jo hyeonwoo they really peaked at the right time as daegu made it to the fa cup final and against the odds defeated ulsan hyundai 51 on aggregate meaning for the first time they will feature in the champions league this is no mean feat for team whose best ever finish in the top flight is 7th place if they carry over their momentum into the 2019 season the year could be one of their most successful ever they will also be playing in a new footballspecific stadium this year

gangwon fc

gangwon are a fairly midbottom team i dont really know what to say about them they did have the 2ndhighest top scorer in the 2018 season though bosnian uros deric they also had the worst colour scheme in the league last season their kit is slightly improved this season

incheon united

i always like to imagine that incheon chose their strip so that they could be the inter to fc seouls ac milan they even have a nickname nerazzurri another nickname is the durumi    the cranes

incheon spent most of the 2018 season at the very bottom of table and had the jointleakiest defence in the league they brought in norwegian manager jrn andersen midway through the season to turn their fortunes around but even after that they were on the wrong end or the biggest thrashing of the season 70 against gangwon coming into the end of the season though they were playing really nice attacking football even if they didnt always get the result at the split they were still bottom but won 4 out of 5 games to pull themselves up 3 places

it was in attack that incheon shone montenegrin stefan mugosa was their top scorer in his debut season moon seonmin with the best goal celebration in the league also put in a strong performance but has now signed for champions jeonbuk nam junjae returned in the summer to score some bangers costa rican international aguilar was also impressive but has signed for jeju in the new season

sangju sangmu

the military team where other k league players get loaned to to complete their military service their history goes far back in one sense as various military teams were playing way back to the 50s but they were founded for pro footballers to serve their time only in 1984 although they were for pro players they competed in the semipro national league until 2003 when they joined the k league based in gwangju when gwangju fc were formed they moved to sangju

sangju sangmu do not have any foreign players for obvious reasons and cannot compete in the champions league although the chances of ever finishing in a qualifying spot are fairly slim

fc seoul

fc seoul wow what happened having won the league in 2016 albeit somewhat fortuitously and always finishing in the top half if not competing for the title in the past decade nobody expected seoul to be fighting against relegation although relatively solid defensively they scored the least number of goals in the league season of all teams their star foreign players almost all left before the season started including dejan to rivals suwon and were not replaced with the same quality and for many matches seoul played with an allkorean team one bit of good news for the future is that former captain osmar will return from his loan to cezero osaka for the new season

seoul at least managed to avoid relegation by beating busan ipark over two legs in the playoff helped by a red card in the first leg surprisingly they managed to score 3 goals in the first leg in open play

seoul is probably the most popular club in korea im sure helped by the fact that it is the main club in a city of 10 million people  seoul generally has the highest game attendances although it was much reduced last season because they were so crap

starting out as luckygoldstar ie lg fc in chungcheong province the team was permitted to relocate to seoul at the start of the 90s and were renamed as lg cheetahs during the decentralisation period they moved to anyang modifying their name to anyang lg cheetahs after the world cup the team successfully negotiated a move back to seoul and did away with their cheetahs moniker taking their current name fc seoul their founding and rebirth years are both on their badge  1983 and 2004

seongnam fc

gaining direct promotion due to asan mugunghwas situation seongnam is actually the most decorated team in korea

founded in 1989 in seoul as ilhwa chunma they were forced out of seoul and settled in cheonnan for a period in 2000 they moved to seongnam a satellite city of seoul and appended the city name to the name of the club seongnams title drought started when the head of the owner company that backed seongnam died in 2012 and the board were keen to let go of the club seongnam city government took over ownership of the club for the 2014 season and they were renamed seongnam fc seongnam are now back in k league 1 after a 2 year absence

k league 2 clubs

by last seasons standings

jeonnam dragons

jeonbuks jeolla province rivals they finished the previous season on an awful losing streak and were relegated for the first time

asan mugunghwa

police fc they missed promotion despite winning k league 2 and will probably lose their police affiliation by next year

busan ipark

one of the founding members of the k league and another that effectively predates the k league busan were beaten by k league 1 opposition in the prorel playoff for the second year in a row they were the first korean team to win the asian continental title in the 80s

daejeon citizen

one of the first communitycityowned clubs in korea

gwangju fc

relegated in the 2017 season despite finishing 5th in 2018 they still got to participate in the playoffs due to asan mugunghwas situation

fc anyang

founded in 2013 finally filling the void left by the departure of fc seoul from the city

suwon fc

the other suwon team they featured in k league 1 briefly in 2016

bucheon fc 1995

formed after the departure of jeju united from the city formed in 2007 1995 refers to the year of the organising of the yukong elephant fan club including 1995 in the name is meant to show its a club for the fans or something

bucheon fc 1995 are also one half of the 032 derby with incheon united because they share the same area code 032

ansan greeners fc

formed only in 2017 theyve had two 9thposition finishes

seoul eland fc

the other seoul team their debut season was in 2015 they didnt do very well last season although it was very tight at the bottom of the table

winter transfer window activity

from a monetary point of view korea is the biggest net exporterhttpsenynacokrviewaen20190131006600315sectionsportsindex of players in asia in the transfer market this winter window was no different with what i would say were the two biggest stories involving young homegrown korean talent going abroad

the first is that of jeonbuk and national team star centreback kim minjae nicknamed the monster there were rumours of an offer from english side watford but it wasnt clear if there ever was any offer or negotiations  kim himself said he did not know of any interest from watford it doesnt really matter now  kim signed with chinese side beijing sinobo guoan and will see champions league football with them in the new season being drawn in the same group as jeonbuk

the second is hwang inbeom who has signed for mls side vancouver whitecaps hwang inbeom played in k league 2 last season with asan mugunghwa and daejeon citizen but has impressed as a midfield playmaker and is currently seen as a replacement for ki sungyueng in the national team

for a recognisable name for western readers the best i have is englishman jordon mutch who signed for gyeongnam from crystal palace resulting in this awkward photo ophttpspbstwimgcommediadzg3adzvyaakrkqformatjpgnamemedium another recognisable name is mix diskerud on loan to ulsan from man city but he joined the previous year

k league 1s top scorer marco left gyeongnam for hebei china fortune and his replacement is luc castaignos signed from sporting cp his stats in europe havent been great in recent years but he may fare better in korea

there were of course a few hundred domestic internal transfers and number of other foreign player signings  if you want the full list k league uniteds winter transfer trackerhttpwwwkleagueunitedcom2019012019kleaguewintertransfertrackerhtml has it all



history of club football in korea  establishment of the k league

association football was first introduced to korea in 1882 when british royal navy crew harboured at incheon played a game it wasnt until the 1900s that football began to take hold and the first public match was played in 1905 there was a boom in in the 1910s with a number of football clubs being formed and rivalries began to form between clubs in seoul and pyongyang

the first nationwide competition was the all joseon football tournament joseon being the name for korea at the time founded in 1921 there wasnt actually a champion crowned in 1921 as the tournament was cut short due to complaints over refereeing decisions all this was taking place during japanese occupation of korea during most of the first half of the 20th century

according to the kfahttpswebarchiveorgweb20170606162658httpkfaorkrrecordhistoryasp football was the only tonic that could relieve the the national resentment that had accumlated in the hearts as a colony under the japanese empire and was a sprout that could foster the hope of freedom a tad hyperbolic maybe

one side effect of being a japanese colony is that some korean teams were allowed to participate in the emperors cup japans fa cup and in 1935 kyungsung fc kyungsung was a name for seoul during japanese occupation won the tournament becoming the only nonjapanese team to ever do so

the all joseon football tournament ran until wwii

after wwii came korean independence and shortly thereafter the korean war there was football being played during this period continuously when possible the korean national semiprofessional football league was founded in 1964 and is the predecessor to todays tier 3 national league many of the teams during this period were works teams  employed by a company playing under the name of the company but also having a proper job in the company cha bumkun said by some to be the greatest ever asian footballer rose to fame during this period albeit mainly in the bundesliga starting his senior career at the mighty seoul trust bank fc the most astonishing statistic about cha bumkun is he only received one yellow card in his career

finally we get to the establishment of professional football with the korean super league in 1983 now named the k league initially there were only 5 teams and 2 of those teams dropped out within 2 years the number of clubs in the top flight has varied from the initial 5 to a high of 16 in 2011 in 2013 the k league split into two tiers now k league 1 and k league 2

for the first few years of the k league teams did not have a fixed home stadium that they played in because there was no standard homeaway format that we are so familiar with today instead it was operated as a national tour

the k league in the modern era has its own history but one of the most interesting events was the forced exodus of all three clubs from seoul in 1996 as part of a policy to spread the popularity of football around the country also with an eye on stadium infrastructure for the 2002 world cup two of the clubs didnt move far only just outside the city of seoul each to one of seouls satellite cities yukong elephants only halfleft because the city they moved to didnt have a stadium yet so they continued to play in seoul until a new stadium was built for a number of years the k league was without any seoul representation in 2004 after the need to find someone to fill a great big national football stadium and help pay towards it one of those relocated teams moved back to seoul becoming fc seoul



football pyramid  league format

the current system looks like this


 tier  league  notes 

 1  k league 1 12 teams 1 relegation to k league 2 1 relegation playoff with k league 2
 2  k league 2  10 teams 1 promotion to k league 1 1 promotion playoff with k league 2
 3  national league  8 teams semipro no promotionrelegation
 4  k3 league advanced  12 teams semiproamateur 2 relegations to k3 league basic 1 relegation playoff with k3 league basic 
 5  k3 league basic 11 teams semiproamateur 2 promotions to k3 league advanced 1 promotion playoff with k3 league advanced 
 6 division 5 league 6 regional leagues with 52 teams some relegation to division 6 
 7  division 6 league 26 regional leagues with 174 teams some prorel with divisions 5  7 
 8  division 7 league 160 regional leagues with 960 teams some promotion with division 6 

as you can see the naming is completely screwed up  k3 league occupies tiers 4 and 5 and division 5 is in tier 6 this is probably because the top tier k league only split in two in 2013 with the creation on k league 2 and nobodys been bothered to update their names

the national league sits stubbornly in tier 3 blocking any continuous prorel the powers that be have regularly stated that they want to reform the pyramid to have a continuous route from top to bottom at least to the bottom of k3 league within a few years but for some reason its not happening the winners of the 2006 national league season were offered promotion to the k league but they declined the offer the winners of the 2007 season were also offered promotion but declined again even though they said they would like promotion at the start of the season

one of the more recent additions to the k league bucheon fc 1995 joined from k3 league because they didnt want to pay the higher fees associated with starting out in the national league

outside of this system there is the wk league the womens top tier the wk league has been dominated by incheon red angels no connection to incheon united in recent years theres no womens champions league in asia yet but for a few years in the past the winners of the wk league played the winners of japans nadeshiko league for a little more info on the wk league see this reddit posthttpswwwredditcomrwomenssoccercommentsaqkew5southkoreasroutetotheworldcupthewkleague

also worth a mention is the separate u league for universities and colleges some of the teams from which enter into the korean fa cup the route into a pro team in korea is often direct from high school or university teams something i dont think exists in europe some high school teams are even seen as feeder teams for a particular pro team i wont pretend to understand how the system works but ill leave you with the tidbit that park jisung was first signed to a professional team from a university team almost by accident as the scout had come to see a different player but took home park instead

k league 1

k league 1 consists of 12 teams playing 38 games the format is identical to the scottish premiership  all teams play each other three times and then after the split the top 6 and bottom 6 battle it out among themselves to settle the championship and relegation spots respectively the first tie breaker for teams level on points is goals scored rather than goal difference

the top 3 places offer a chance in the afc champions league the fourth champions league spot going to the winner of the korean fa cup bottom place gets relegated to k league 2 whilst 11th place has a playoff with one of the teams that finished 2nd4th in k league 2

international context

in the current format of the afc champions league the competition is split into a west region think uae saudi arabia qatar iran and an east region the east region is dominated by three nations  korea china and japan australia who decided it wanted to be asian earlier this century has also had a bit of success

this year there will be two debutants from korea  gyeongnam fc and daegu fc its dufficult to predict how well these two will fare but if they can carry some form over to this year they could get out of the group stages at least

determining who has the strongest teams amongst the big three east asian nations is a difficult task and is hugely subjective im almost i say almost because obviously k league is best league of the opinion that theyre as close to equal as makes no difference korea has the most number of titles and the club with the most titles pohang steelers china have the highest coefficient japan has won the past two tournaments

in recent years china and japan have had a number of big star foreigner signings eg paulinho torres which are absent from the k league i believe this is due to japan having cash mainly coming from tv money and china having cash from well being china despite korea lagging financially all three nations have the same limit on foreign players three foreigners plus one from another afc country and so korean teams are still competitive due to the relative strength of their domestic players

while were on the topic of the champions league each of the big three east asian nations get 4 places total  2 or 3 to the group stages and 1 or 2 to the last qualifying playoff round before the group stages this playoff round is massively weighted in the big threes favour as they have to win just one home game when the weather is still genrally freezing cold against a team from a nation with a tropical climate i dont know of a korean club ever losing this playoff match

the afc cup is sometimes said to be the equivalent of uefas europa league but its not really comparable the afc cup is for the weaker asian nations only and korea arent allowed to enter



resources

websites  podcasts

for those of us who are linguistically challenged heres how you can follow k league in english

one of the best websites for news match previews and analysis is k league unitedhttpwwwkleagueunitedcom it covers everything  k league 1  2 fa cup transfer news national team and more it also has a podcast if youre into that sort of thing

a really good resource for uptodate breaking news is an english version of a korean news outlet the sports category of yonhap newshttpsenynacokrsportsindex for example is great although youll be getting other sports news in there such as korean baseball football appears pretty regularly also the team that works on writing the articles dont seem to work weekends

tavern of the taeguk warriorshttpwwwtaegukwarriorscom has a lot of information mainly on the korean national team and tracks the progress of koreans playing in europe but covers the domestic club scene now and then

48 shades of footballhttps48shadesblogcom is a great english language podcast following korean football

the asian gamehttpswwwtheasiangamenet is another great english language podcast that doesnt specifically follow korean football but since they cover asian football theyll sometimes have indepth coverage of the korean clubs competing in the afc champions league as well as the korean national team

for your twitter fix the korea football news korfootballnewshttpstwittercomkorfootballnews and viva la kleague kleagueno1httpstwittercomkleagueno1 twitter feeds are pretty quick with breaking news in english 

there is also the official k league websitehttpwwwkleaguecom which can be viewed in english but i think unless you live in korea its going to be painfully slow to use

then of course theres rkleague with news and discussion and where you can ask questions to the community

highlights  watching live

all highlights from k league 1 matches are uploaded fairly promptly to the spotv youtube channelhttpswwwyoutubecomuserspotv spotv is a korean sports broadcaster they also upload content from the kbo baseball and the v league volleyball so youll have to scroll down until you see something saying k1 it helps if you know how korean letters sound phonetically to understand which teams are playing but you can also see which match a video is from the crests in the thumbnail the commentary will be in korean but each video is really good quality typically about 10 minutes long

if you watch to watch live the good news is that is very easy and basically free i have no idea whether any national broadcasters or streaming services around the world have k league rights but in korea itself essentia"
chungcheong,travelling around korea for 34 weeks in aprilmay any suggestions,"im travelling with a friend for 12 weeks initially well be around the seoul area northern region in general the only thing on our itinerary right now is going on the hangang cycling route and hanging around seoul talking to locals and other travellers that sort of thing 

after that i will be off on my own and i intend to go around as many less touristy areas as possible i would say i like nature so any place with national parks or mountainous areas are good the general areas im looking at are gyeonggi gangwon north chungcheong south gyeongsang south jeolla i would like to go to the larger cities too so on my list right now theres seoul daejeon daegu gyeongju gwangju and busan plus the jirisan and seoraksan national parks i might want to go hiking at some point too and am looking at either the national parks andor the mountainseaside region near busan 

which would be the best way to travel around  bus rail or both also what are couchsurfing prospects like in places outside of seoul any suggestions for itinerary id prefer places that are off the usual beaten path for tourists someone has suggested daejeon for instance and places with natural scenery im not that interested in the cultural aspect but if theres a place thats very much worth visiting id love to find out more thanks"

chungcheong,19f south korea  aprilmay 2016 2 weeks,"i will be travelling around the northern part hangang area with a friend for 12 weeks and then going off on my own after that ill be touring as much of south korea as possible with a focus on going to places with lots of nature and meeting locals and possibly hiking 

im fluent in english and mandarin and will be officially learning korean by the end of this year areas im looking at the national parks gyeonggi gangwon south jeolla north chungcheong south gyeongsangdo jejudo i definitely want to stop by the larger cities too like seoul daegu busan etc more info herehttpswwwredditcomrkoreacomments3igla8travellingaroundkoreafor34weeksinaprilmay

most likely will be travelling by public transport apparently by car is the best but i cant drive so and bumming out in cheap hostels andor couchsurfing cheap food budget travel essentially"
chungcheong,event new visa and foreign worker laws,"the number of immigrants in korea has been exploding over the last few years and is now at around 42 million most of them young and working who can balance out the aging korean population the nationalities of immigrants has changed somewhat and those accepted in 2019 are as follows



country of origin  propotion

china  301
thailand  123
philippines  116
vietnam  86
usa  51
indonesia  46
turkey  26
iran  25
bangladesh  23
japan  21
yemen  19
lebanon  17
egypt  15
pakistan  05

the domination of chinese immigration is decreasing with more coming in from south east asia south asia and even a noticeable amount from the middle east the thai filipino vietnamese and indonesian population have set up primarily in the siheung ansan and namdong suburbs of seoul siheung is now just over 50 foreignborn making it the first city in korea to have a majority foreign populationthe area to the south west of seoul is home to a vibrant multicultural food scene and is a favourite destination for seoulites



ulsan also has a significant immigrant population with many working manual jobs in the factories as does chungcheong middle eastern labourers  are more common in the south of the country with a around the country foreigners are employed to work low paid construction jobs the vast majority are in seoul gyeonggi or incheon 

the only sources of tension have been in highly conservative daegu home of the dokdo party in a high profile incident nationalist thugs broke into a lebanese takeaway and beat to death the 3 employees and 5 customers 6 of them lebanese and 2 korean this received nationwide media coverage and the 4 criminals have been put on death row with many campaigning for an end to the de facto abolition of capital punishment an antiimmigrant protest nearly turned into a riot and water cannons had to be used to disperse the rabble

we are now less of a homogeneous society immigrants are not exclusively clustered in their own quarters of cities an increasing number are integrating fully and accepted as equally important citizens people of nonkorean races are seen almost regularly on the television and in the news and there are several popular filipino internet personalities these new laws will reflect the changes in korea

 the e9 low skilled foreign worker visa currently allows foreigners to work for up to 4 years and 10 months in manufacturing agricultural construction and some services jobs resettlement of dependents is not legally permitted and this is a temporary visa many on these visas stay illegally and continue to work this will no longer be illegal but encouraged if after the 4 years and 10 months the worker can pass a test on korean culture and history and demonstrates basic korean language skills they may bring their immediate family over and stay here permanently
 we will be introducing a new f7 visa ethnic koreans from anywhere in the world who prove their lineage from a korean citizen within 3 generations will be able to travel live study and work freely in korea for up to 5 years and must only reside here for 3 before naturalisation
 young people in their final year of education on the d2 student visa may apply for a job seeking visa which they can live on for 6 months if they find a professional job in this time then they may naturalise after 6 months of work
 we will introduce a new test which foreigners can take before applying for their visa the visa applicant skill assessment this will test their mathematical scientific and logical skills to see if they are particularly intellectually gifted those who score very highly may apply for a special d2 student visa which offers discounted education for the disadvantaged or for a visa which will allow them to live in korea for up to a year while they search for work when they can get an employment visa
 foreign workers will receive the same legal working rights as natural born koreans the new foreign labor commission will ensure that these standards are being met and that foreigners are not mistreated with anonymous internet and telephone reporting systems and occasional random checks of employers with many reports
 the foreign labor commission will set up a database of foreign workers with their qualifications skills and legal status which companies can search to quickly find suitable employees
 antihate crime laws have been introduced to combat the racist abuse suffered by many workers verbal racial abuse will be punished by a fine of 1500 if crimes including assault criminal damage harassment murder sexual assault and burglary are shown to have been committed for racial reasons sentencing will be harsher
 the employment permit system which requires foreigners to gain permission from employers before changing jobs leads to exploitation and will be scrapped instead they will only have to prove that they have received a job offer from another company to change jobs"

jeolla,news jamboree scouts leaving results in sadness for jeollabukdos dreams of profits,"article linkhttpsnnewsnavercomarticle0010014114237sid102 korean

rough translation

 when the government decided to proceed with the saemangeum world scout jamboree despite the outbreak of heatrelated illnesses jeollabukdo north jeolla province breathed a sigh of relief however with the jamboree being unable to be held in its entirety and the scout members leaving to events scheduled in other regions the province cannot hide its regret   
  
on the 5th prime minister han deoksu stated considering the heat wave the government recommends organizing various programs in other regions outside of saemangeum and will provide sufficient support including transportation for those participants  
  
as a result the scout members from various countries will be moving to national tourist attractions and other places until the 12th to complete the remaining schedule  
  
with the scout members who were mainly scheduled to be active in 14 cities and counties within jeollabukdo now venturing outside of the region local authorities must make significant modifications to the jamboree plans  
  
the high expectations jeollabukdo had for this jamboree have been greatly disappointed   
  
it was hoped that a successful event would elevate the national brand image and accelerate the saemangeum development project leading the way for regional development however the extreme heat the carelessness of the organizing committee and inadequate preparations have hindered the events progress  
  
the province had planned to conduct themebased fam tours for domestic and international influencers and bloggers producing various contentfilled videos for promotion on social networking services sns they also developed new travel courses including the saemangeum environmental ecological park  
  
additionally they aimed to attract family travelers with mini jamboree experiences and planned to use cultural artistic and sports institutions to attract visitors building an image of jeollabukdo tourism  
  
however with the participants scattered in various areas these strategies are now at risk of being futile  
  
as a globally significant event the jamboree has substantial economic impacts both tangible and intangible and boosts the national brand image  
  
with over 43000 participants staying for 12 days they are expected to engage in various korean cultural experiences and consume local goods vigorously resulting in substantial economic effects according to the analysis by the jeollabukdo research institute during the jamboree period an estimated 90000 visitors spending was expected to generate 755 billion won in production effects and create around 800 jobs within the province  
  
jeollabukdo expected growth in its tourism industry through image promotion and brand advertising they also anticipated the potential growth in the tourism and camping industry by utilizing the jamboree site after its conclusion however it seems that the achievement of these goals has already failed  
  
a representative from the province said on the 6th jeollabukdo and the 14 cities and counties had placed significant emphasis on preparing for the jamboree but various unforeseen factors forced us to modify our strategies adding while we are fortunate that the event has not been canceled altogether we cannot reasonably hope for any jamboree profits

jeolla,why havent korean opted for a federaldecentralized government in its thousands year history,"i just feel like it would make more sense if koreans just opted for a more decentralized yet ethnically homogenous state because of how stubborn many koreans are in their nature they just cant seem to agree on anything a lot of the time 

ive travelled to korea for many years and despite their uniform language and food there seems to be pretty vast differences in terms of what each provinceregion needs for its own economic and cultural development korea has had a very long history of basically hating each others guts dating way back to the jin and gojoseon era and proto three kingdoms era heck id even argue that cultural remnants of these different kingdoms still remain in different parts of south koreachungcheong gyeongsang jeolla urban core of seoulgyeonggi etc and dont even get me started on cultural and economic differences between the north and south

in fact i think the process of decentralizing the korean provinces may be even more important if korea were to reunify in the distant future even if korea were to reunify gradually and safely theres no doubt the northern and south provinces will still have massive cultural differences and mindsets so why not give each province more control and autonomy perhaps a federal republic of  koreainstead of the republic of korea would be more conducive for a stable polity"
jeolla,190701  bts world experience by game reporter in his 30s,"source from this articlehttpmgameinsightcokrnewsarticleviewhtmlidxno18379

x200b

this is a review by a gaming reporter an ahjussi in his 30s who isnt familiar with the bts members    i thought it was fun to read so i tried translating it  

x200b

i hope you dont take it too seriously and enjoy reading please dont argue about the game being femalemale targeted here since thats been done many other times on other posts

x200b

x200b

bts world experience 1   first impression of the members in a man in his 30s trying very hard to not cringe review of bts raising game

x200b

the inevitable time has come

on the evening of 26th this was my thought as bts world server opened   i had flashbacks of the times i had confidently told my colleagues that i will withstand this game  my colleague reporters were already fallen from not being able to tolerate the previews before the game came out  it was up to me to do it

honestly i had confidence one time i had been exposed and survived a lot of other examples while doing research on the market targeted at female gamers  i even did a bit of prep work doing the superstar bts game  i tend to listen to idol songs regardless of gender if the songs are good  i pressed play  bts my friends since im the manager youre gonna have a full schedule

bts world is a cinematic simulation game of upbringing collecting and exchange  in the play the story takes a large portion and the data volume of the game is beyond imagination

the play is similar to chinese female oriented dating simulations love and producer by paper games  to share phone calls text and communicate by sns as well as to clear missions with card levels  in conclusion you need powers of fighting against the evils of cringe  although the manager that keeps trying to cross the line made me a bit nervous i tried to pick the most rational choices and build my affinity

i thought i would be able to withstand it but it wasnt easy  the beginning was especially a bit of a crisis  why do we get one liners on a shiny background of things like copper tanned skin charismatic eyes or skin like white jade  in addition these are not even about fictional characters but of people who actually exist

writing this while squirming and wailing

x200b

while playing this game i focused on the game system as much as possible and regained my calm  im just a gamer that is raising up fictional characters  2012 is just another universe that the protagonist fell in  its just another possible past of the 14 million pasts that dr strange saw  selfhypnosis with these thoughts gave me peace

i had noticed it while playing superstarbts as well but its not easy to tell people apart when theyre all styled like an album cover  many men dont really pay attention to faces of other men  it was my first  hurdle to become an army  army will know who they are even by looking at their shadows  as if to say this there were a lot of ux design that didnt tell me the name of the character  as a beginner i had no choice but to learn them

finally after learning the faces and characters of the bts members im writing down the initial impressions of the 7 members  these are just personal impression  im up to chapter 5 of the story

jin  he seems like a protagonist in a romantic comedy  with elegant impression and figure he is an ideal of a handsome man  there are not many things in the world that men hate as much as actual handsome men saying theyre handsome all the time  but whenever he opens his mouth there is something not quite all there about him  this must be his unexpected charms  he was so unexpectedly funny that i ended up actually laughing out loud a number of times  his character as the luxury version of the common neighborhood hyung is quite unique as well

suga  he seems to be the tsendere rule enforcer  during another story the genre suddenly changes into beethoven virus kdrama  he becomes suddenly the most serious person in the world when music comes up as a topic  did they say a man who has focus on his work is sexy  he seemed to hate bangtan sonyeondan group name the most i understand him  if you think hes a bit too sensitive he shows his caring side while pretending to be not caring  it felt like a female heroine from a typical maletargeted game had gotten swept in a storm and fell into a typical femaletargeted game

jhope  even when he is not in the centre of attention i could see he was always smiling  he doesnt say things that stand out too much  he has the aura of being able to mingle and get along well no matter which group he falls into  in the game he seems to be the type of subcharacter that is protagonists brother or hoobae that cheerfully leads the protagonist a few times  his cards especially seem to have poses that express im cute

rm  he showed charisma even from the beginning of the game  if i met him in real life i would probably call him hyung  in reality anyone who seems more powerful is really the hyung  i thought he would be a sports man but it was interesting to find out he was studying creative literature  i also felt camaraderie when he kept losing or breaking things  he seems to be good at writing and is very logical  i would like to nominate him as potential winner if there were a keyboard battle contest

jimin  when i first saw bts i thought he was the youngest  he is cute and i really like his eyes  he appears as the grandson of a rice cake business and i think he would have fit well even if he really went into that business  i was surprised he had good acting in the another story  he seems to be the type that does everything well when given the chance  he was so attractive when he was wanting food it made me want to buy him a meal  his reactions are always good so teasing him seemed most satisfying  if i could have one of them as a younger brother i would choose jimin

v  i really dont know  i cant define his character no even his mental world is not of this world  the speech does not go in introbuild upclimaxresolution but introresolution  character deoni dalbi in a book by lee youngdo had this type of speech and i didnt know i would meet such person in real life  if i were to live with someone like this life would never be boring  of course life would also never be peaceful but   when he wrote the lyrics glassmentality boy i liked his artistic emotions

jungkook  hes the youngest and he really does act like the youngest  the conversation images seemed to have been made to be especially cute  unlike jimin i feel like he would be hurt if i tease him so i cant tease him  initially he seemed like a kid who wanted to be mature but later on i could see a bit of that maturity as the character seemed to grow his image in the cards at times were so different that sometimes i could not recognize him  when hes smiling sometimes hes difficult to distinguish from jhope  he suddenly seems very dependable when he starts singing

x200b

x200b

time travel to 2012 is a bit of a cliche premise  the fact that we know they become world stars neutralizes the limits of idols in reality  as the protagonist already knows the future the player can focus on the details of each step as they naturally reach that point along the way

even now i have each members profile up beside me as im working hard on this game  ive even found an error in the process v is from daegu but when he goes to the countryside he uses jeolla satoori  but outside of that i can see that they put in a lot of effort to be consistent with many things about bts  and it was interesting to play another story of what may have happened to the members if they did not become bts

the flower thats used to level up the cards is smeraldo and its a flower that doesnt exist created by bighit to sound like it existed to be used as hints in bts worldand many other tmis have been absorbed into my brain now  i might have to join army fanclub in order to finish this game

x200b

the game ost heartbeat was a very nice song to listen to  and the mv cinematography wasnt cringy either  it looked like they put in a lot of effort and looks like a scene from a drama  the acting by members look natural too  the talk bubbles were the only part that was a bit difficult to watch

bts world exploration has just started for me  since ive survived the trials and tribulations of adjusting to the game i will play this as far as i can  next article youll be able to see an ajussi manager in his 30s training the bts  the fact that it feels like im the one being trained rather than btssurely is just my imagination"

 fc seoul won their playoff against k league 2s busan ipark  
 seongnam fc were promoted from k league 2  
 ulsan won their champions league playoff and are in the group stages

its impossible to write a concise summary of the 2018 season  you can get some of the details from the club guide below  but one of the most interesting stories actually comes from k league 2

for context you need to understand a bit about military service for footballers rather than take 2 years out of their career to serve in the military or do some kind of eg desk job service players can join one of two military football teams that play in the k league in k league 1 there is sangju sangmu and in k league 2 there is asan mugunghwa every player in these two teams is on loan for two years from another club in the k league sangju sangu is affiliated with the normal military whilst asan mugunghwa is affiliated with the police serving in the auxilliary police force is another way to do your service

the korean government recently decided to abolish the auxilliary police force by 2023 the police however decided to already wind down their sports teams putting an immediate halt on recruiting players and disbanding the teams in 2019

now the champions of k league 2 last season were asan mugunghwa they were in line for direct promotion to k league 1 to compete in the k league you need to have at least 20 players but by the time the next season started asan would only have 14 players as the loan deals ran out the league gave asan a deadline in november to submit a recruitment plan which they failed to do and so the promotion spot passed to secondplaced seongnam fc although that deadline and hence promotion was missed asan have how submitted a recruitment plan that would see their 14 serving players be supplemented by new signings that indicates the club will transition to an cityowned club with the help of the asan government

funnily or depressingly this is not the first time police fc won k league 2 and missed out on promotion  in 2016 ansan mugunghwa were crowned champions but at the end of that year moved from ansan to asan in line with the leagues policies they were registered as a brand new club

k league 1 club guide

clubs can have up to three foreign players in their squad plus an extra one from another afc nation although rare a player with north korea citizenship is not considered foreign most of those foreign places are taken by brazilians or players from the former yugoslavia eg k league veteran dejan damjanovic the exception to the foreigner rule is the goalkeeper  korean goalkeepers in the 90s were just so bad that a block on recruiting foreign goalieshttpwwwkleagueunitedcom201703foreigngoalkeepersinfavourofhtml was put in place to help encourage development of domestic talent it seems to have worked with korean goalkeepers often being signed abroad in asia at least

there is also a requirement to have u23 players fielded and on the bench with a failure to meet this impacting the number of substitutes that can be made article 30httpswwwkleaguecomaboutcompetition of the league rules

youll notice some of the clubs have a korean chaebol in their team name and even if its not in the name they may still be owned by a corporation behind the scenes this sounds very odd if youre not familiar with it but it is extremely common in japan china and korea it may just be a symptom of some of the teams being relatively recentlyfounded and perhaps isnt that unusual these days think red bull city group majority shareholders in the west however the number of citizen clubs owned by the local city or provincial government is on the rise  gyeongnam fc is one example

a lot of clubs probably like to think they have a derby with fc seoul because well its seoul but the  biggest and probably considered the national derby is the super match  between fc seoul and suwon samsung bluewings montenegrin damjanovic known simply as dejan formerly of seoul and now playing for suwon is the top scorer in this fixture

heres the clubs by last seasons standing and since crests are a bit unstable on reddit at the moment heres an imgur album of all club crests and corresponding home kits for the 2019 seasonhttpimgurcomaw8dbla5

jeonbuk hyundai motors

jeonbuk are the dominant team in korea and one the of the teams you dont want to face in the champions league whoever you are theyve now won 4 out of the last 5 k league 1 titles and a most recent champions league title in 2016

their rise to power over the last decade has been overseen by long term manager choi kanghee choi left at the end of last season to tianjin quanjintianhai daliang yifang fc in china korea seems to have a thing for portuguese managers these days and his replacement is one jos morais morais was assistant manager to jos mourinho for a period but as manager proper hes been a bit shit he was at two clubs in 2018 which included ushering barnsley into relegation to english league one how jeonbuk will fare after choi remains to be seen

although jeonbuk cruised to the league title it would be difficult to call their season an outright success due to a horrendous 15 mins at the end of the second half in a home match against suwon in the champions league quarterfinal they turned the 3 goal deficit around in the seond leg when they travelled to suwon but went out on penalties 

gyeongnam fc

gyeongnam were only promoted from k league 2 the previous season so coming second in k league 1 is something special top scorer in the league marco played his part with 26 goals

gyeongnam will now feature in the champions league for the first time i thought that seems to have put the brakes on too many of their players departing but captain choi youngjun signed for jeonbuk in the winter transfer window a major loss is marco who was also top scorer in k league 2 in the year they were promoted who appears to have followed the money to china also off to china is key centreback park jisoo so basically the backbone of the team from defence to attack has left

ulsan hyundai

known as the horangi   the tigers  ulsan have had intermittent success in asia winning the champions league for the first and only time in 2012 in an unbeaten run

towards the end of the 2018 season ulsan were battling gyeongnam for the second spot which brings with it direct qualification to the champions league group stages rather than having a playoff they lost out but were widely expected to secure a direct qualification spot anyway when they faced daegu fc in the fa cup final ultimately they finished the season on a low losing 51 on aggregate to daegu in the final 

pohang steelers

one of the few clubs that predates the formation of the k league pohang are another of the historical korean powerhouses they hold the record for the most number of champions league title 3 but their last title came in 2009

finishing fourth in the league they were hoping that ulsan would beat daegu in the fa cup final to pass their champions league spot on down but it didnt happen

jeju united

one of the original members of the k league founded as the yukong elephants in the seoul area as part of the decentralisation program they moved to bucheon kind of and were renamed as bucheon sk the decision to move to jeju in 2006 was an abrupt one and understandably deeply unpopular with the fans teams uprooting and moving elsewhere is a bit of a catalyst for the creation of new teams in korea and the fans formed bucheon fc 1995 in the absence of bucheon sk

the reason given for the relocation was to the address the imbalance in football teams being located around seoulgyeonggido and jeju did not have a pro team at the time but there are suggestions the owners sk group wanted to cut their investment and recoup some costs

there were recent rumours that jeju would move yet again back north to yongin but who knows 

jeju had a pretty mediocre season what more can i say

suwon samsung bluewings

suwons 2018 season was a bit bonkers and especially so in their champions league run

in their champions league group in which they were drawn with eventual winners kashima antlers suwon did not manage a single home win however they had managed to get two away wins and going into the final match they still had their fate in their own hands if they could win against group leaders kashima in japan they won 10 getting three away wins and topping the group

manager seo jungwon at a time when suwon were 4th in the league resigned the day before the first leg of their champions league quarterfinal clash with jeonbuk due to fan protests jeonbuk were apparently completely bamboozled by this event and took a 30 beating at home then in the return leg in suwon jeonbuk fought back to win 30 but suwon were able to scrape through on penalties to face kashima antlers yet again in the semis

in the semifinal fixture suwon went 20 up against kashima antlers inside the first 10 minutes but went on to lose 32 in the first leg
soon after manager seo returned as suddenly as he had departed having been gone for just 6 weeks  
in the second leg suwon went a goal down in the first half but came back with 3 in the second half to be on their way to the final after 60 mins played however kashima antlers fought back to get two more goals and win 65 on aggregate and would go on to win the final if you want to relive a part of that rollercoaster night here you gohttpsyoutuberxy8pagy1aq and heres an idea of the atmosphere that nighthttpstwittercomtheafcclstatus1055055104607285248

at one point it looked like they might qualify for the champions league again for the 2019 season but suwon didnt win any of their final five league matches and dropped to 6th

manager seo left again at the end of the season and will manage japans sagan tosu recently captain kim eunsun was released from the club for drinkdriving the drama just never ends

daegu fc

prior to the world cup daegu were languishing at the bottom of the table but after the return they found some kind of consistent form helped out by world cup hero goalkeeper jo hyeonwoo they really peaked at the right time as daegu made it to the fa cup final and against the odds defeated ulsan hyundai 51 on aggregate meaning for the first time they will feature in the champions league this is no mean feat for team whose best ever finish in the top flight is 7th place if they carry over their momentum into the 2019 season the year could be one of their most successful ever they will also be playing in a new footballspecific stadium this year

gangwon fc

gangwon are a fairly midbottom team i dont really know what to say about them they did have the 2ndhighest top scorer in the 2018 season though bosnian uros deric they also had the worst colour scheme in the league last season their kit is slightly improved this season

incheon united

i always like to imagine that incheon chose their strip so that they could be the inter to fc seouls ac milan they even have a nickname nerazzurri another nickname is the durumi    the cranes

incheon spent most of the 2018 season at the very bottom of table and had the jointleakiest defence in the league they brought in norwegian manager jrn andersen midway through the season to turn their fortunes around but even after that they were on the wrong end or the biggest thrashing of the season 70 against gangwon coming into the end of the season though they were playing really nice attacking football even if they didnt always get the result at the split they were still bottom but won 4 out of 5 games to pull themselves up 3 places

it was in attack that incheon shone montenegrin stefan mugosa was their top scorer in his debut season moon seonmin with the best goal celebration in the league also put in a strong performance but has now signed for champions jeonbuk nam junjae returned in the summer to score some bangers costa rican international aguilar was also impressive but has signed for jeju in the new season

sangju sangmu

the military team where other k league players get loaned to to complete their military service their history goes far back in one sense as various military teams were playing way back to the 50s but they were founded for pro footballers to serve their time only in 1984 although they were for pro players they competed in the semipro national league until 2003 when they joined the k league based in gwangju when gwangju fc were formed they moved to sangju

sangju sangmu do not have any foreign players for obvious reasons and cannot compete in the champions league although the chances of ever finishing in a qualifying spot are fairly slim

fc seoul

fc seoul wow what happened having won the league in 2016 albeit somewhat fortuitously and always finishing in the top half if not competing for the title in the past decade nobody expected seoul to be fighting against relegation although relatively solid defensively they scored the least number of goals in the league season of all teams their star foreign players almost all left before the season started including dejan to rivals suwon and were not replaced with the same quality and for many matches seoul played with an allkorean team one bit of good news for the future is that former captain osmar will return from his loan to cezero osaka for the new season

seoul at least managed to avoid relegation by beating busan ipark over two legs in the playoff helped by a red card in the first leg surprisingly they managed to score 3 goals in the first leg in open play

seoul is probably the most popular club in korea im sure helped by the fact that it is the main club in a city of 10 million people  seoul generally has the highest game attendances although it was much reduced last season because they were so crap

starting out as luckygoldstar ie lg fc in chungcheong province the team was permitted to relocate to seoul at the start of the 90s and were renamed as lg cheetahs during the decentralisation period they moved to anyang modifying their name to anyang lg cheetahs after the world cup the team successfully negotiated a move back to seoul and did away with their cheetahs moniker taking their current name fc seoul their founding and rebirth years are both on their badge  1983 and 2004

seongnam fc

gaining direct promotion due to asan mugunghwas situation seongnam is actually the most decorated team in korea

founded in 1989 in seoul as ilhwa chunma they were forced out of seoul and settled in cheonnan for a period in 2000 they moved to seongnam a satellite city of seoul and appended the city name to the name of the club seongnams title drought started when the head of the owner company that backed seongnam died in 2012 and the board were keen to let go of the club seongnam city government took over ownership of the club for the 2014 season and they were renamed seongnam fc seongnam are now back in k league 1 after a 2 year absence

k league 2 clubs

by last seasons standings

jeonnam dragons

jeonbuks jeolla province rivals they finished the previous season on an awful losing streak and were relegated for the first time

asan mugunghwa

police fc they missed promotion despite winning k league 2 and will probably lose their police affiliation by next year

busan ipark

one of the founding members of the k league and another that effectively predates the k league busan were beaten by k league 1 opposition in the prorel playoff for the second year in a row they were the first korean team to win the asian continental title in the 80s

daejeon citizen

one of the first communitycityowned clubs in korea

gwangju fc

relegated in the 2017 season despite finishing 5th in 2018 they still got to participate in the playoffs due to asan mugunghwas situation

fc anyang

founded in 2013 finally filling the void left by the departure of fc seoul from the city

suwon fc

the other suwon team they featured in k league 1 briefly in 2016

bucheon fc 1995

formed after the departure of jeju united from the city formed in 2007 1995 refers to the year of the organising of the yukong elephant fan club including 1995 in the name is meant to show its a club for the fans or something

bucheon fc 1995 are also one half of the 032 derby with incheon united because they share the same area code 032

ansan greeners fc

formed only in 2017 theyve had two 9thposition finishes

seoul eland fc

the other seoul team their debut season was in 2015 they didnt do very well last season although it was very tight at the bottom of the table

winter transfer window activity

from a monetary point of view korea is the biggest net exporterhttpsenynacokrviewaen20190131006600315sectionsportsindex of players in asia in the transfer market this winter window was no different with what i would say were the two biggest stories involving young homegrown korean talent going abroad

the first is that of jeonbuk and national team star centreback kim minjae nicknamed the monster there were rumours of an offer from english side watford but it wasnt clear if there ever was any offer or negotiations  kim himself said he did not know of any interest from watford it doesnt really matter now  kim signed with chinese side beijing sinobo guoan and will see champions league football with them in the new season being drawn in the same group as jeonbuk

the second is hwang inbeom who has signed for mls side vancouver whitecaps hwang inbeom played in k league 2 last season with asan mugunghwa and daejeon citizen but has impressed as a midfield playmaker and is currently seen as a replacement for ki sungyueng in the national team

for a recognisable name for western readers the best i have is englishman jordon mutch who signed for gyeongnam from crystal palace resulting in this awkward photo ophttpspbstwimgcommediadzg3adzvyaakrkqformatjpgnamemedium another recognisable name is mix diskerud on loan to ulsan from man city but he joined the previous year

k league 1s top scorer marco left gyeongnam for hebei china fortune and his replacement is luc castaignos signed from sporting cp his stats in europe havent been great in recent years but he may fare better in korea

there were of course a few hundred domestic internal transfers and number of other foreign player signings  if you want the full list k league uniteds winter transfer trackerhttpwwwkleagueunitedcom2019012019kleaguewintertransfertrackerhtml has it all



history of club football in korea  establishment of the k league

association football was first introduced to korea in 1882 when british royal navy crew harboured at incheon played a game it wasnt until the 1900s that football began to take hold and the first public match was played in 1905 there was a boom in in the 1910s with a number of football clubs being formed and rivalries began to form between clubs in seoul and pyongyang

the first nationwide competition was the all joseon football tournament joseon being the name for korea at the time founded in 1921 there wasnt actually a champion crowned in 1921 as the tournament was cut short due to complaints over refereeing decisions all this was taking place during japanese occupation of korea during most of the first half of the 20th century

according to the kfahttpswebarchiveorgweb20170606162658httpkfaorkrrecordhistoryasp football was the only tonic that could relieve the the national resentment that had accumlated in the hearts as a colony under the japanese empire and was a sprout that could foster the hope of freedom a tad hyperbolic maybe

one side effect of being a japanese colony is that some korean teams were allowed to participate in the emperors cup japans fa cup and in 1935 kyungsung fc kyungsung was a name for seoul during japanese occupation won the tournament becoming the only nonjapanese team to ever do so

the all joseon football tournament ran until wwii

after wwii came korean independence and shortly thereafter the korean war there was football being played during this period continuously when possible the korean national semiprofessional football league was founded in 1964 and is the predecessor to todays tier 3 national league many of the teams during this period were works teams  employed by a company playing under the name of the company but also having a proper job in the company cha bumkun said by some to be the greatest ever asian footballer rose to fame during this period albeit mainly in the bundesliga starting his senior career at the mighty seoul trust bank fc the most astonishing statistic about cha bumkun is he only received one yellow card in his career

finally we get to the establishment of professional football with the korean super league in 1983 now named the k league initially there were only 5 teams and 2 of those teams dropped out within 2 years the number of clubs in the top flight has varied from the initial 5 to a high of 16 in 2011 in 2013 the k league split into two tiers now k league 1 and k league 2

for the first few years of the k league teams did not have a fixed home stadium that they played in because there was no standard homeaway format that we are so familiar with today instead it was operated as a national tour

the k league in the modern era has its own history but one of the most interesting events was the forced exodus of all three clubs from seoul in 1996 as part of a policy to spread the popularity of football around the country also with an eye on stadium infrastructure for the 2002 world cup two of the clubs didnt move far only just outside the city of seoul each to one of seouls satellite cities yukong elephants only halfleft because the city they moved to didnt have a stadium yet so they continued to play in seoul until a new stadium was built for a number of years the k league was without any seoul representation in 2004 after the need to find someone to fill a great big national football stadium and help pay towards it one of those relocated teams moved back to seoul becoming fc seoul



football pyramid  league format

the current system looks like this


 tier  league  notes 

 1  k league 1 12 teams 1 relegation to k league 2 1 relegation playoff with k league 2
 2  k league 2  10 teams 1 promotion to k league 1 1 promotion playoff with k league 2
 3  national league  8 teams semipro no promotionrelegation
 4  k3 league advanced  12 teams semiproamateur 2 relegations to k3 league basic 1 relegation playoff with k3 league basic 
 5  k3 league basic 11 teams semiproamateur 2 promotions to k3 league advanced 1 promotion playoff with k3 league advanced 
 6 division 5 league 6 regional leagues with 52 teams some relegation to division 6 
 7  division 6 league 26 regional leagues with 174 teams some prorel with divisions 5  7 
 8  division 7 league 160 regional leagues with 960 teams some promotion with division 6 

as you can see the naming is completely screwed up  k3 league occupies tiers 4 and 5 and division 5 is in tier 6 this is probably because the top tier k league only split in two in 2013 with the creation on k league 2 and nobodys been bothered to update their names

the national league sits stubbornly in tier 3 blocking any continuous prorel the powers that be have regularly stated that they want to reform the pyramid to have a continuous route from top to bottom at least to the bottom of k3 league within a few years but for some reason its not happening the winners of the 2006 national league season were offered promotion to the k league but they declined the offer the winners of the 2007 season were also offered promotion but declined again even though they said they would like promotion at the start of the season

one of the more recent additions to the k league bucheon fc 1995 joined from k3 league because they didnt want to pay the higher fees associated with starting out in the national league

outside of this system there is the wk league the womens top tier the wk league has been dominated by incheon red angels no connection to incheon united in recent years theres no womens champions league in asia yet but for a few years in the past the winners of the wk league played the winners of japans nadeshiko league for a little more info on the wk league see this reddit posthttpswwwredditcomrwomenssoccercommentsaqkew5southkoreasroutetotheworldcupthewkleague

also worth a mention is the separate u league for universities and colleges some of the teams from which enter into the korean fa cup the route into a pro team in korea is often direct from high school or university teams something i dont think exists in europe some high school teams are even seen as feeder teams for a particular pro team i wont pretend to understand how the system works but ill leave you with the tidbit that park jisung was first signed to a professional team from a university team almost by accident as the scout had come to see a different player but took home park instead

k league 1

k league 1 consists of 12 teams playing 38 games the format is identical to the scottish premiership  all teams play each other three times and then after the split the top 6 and bottom 6 battle it out among themselves to settle the championship and relegation spots respectively the first tie breaker for teams level on points is goals scored rather than goal difference

the top 3 places offer a chance in the afc champions league the fourth champions league spot going to the winner of the korean fa cup bottom place gets relegated to k league 2 whilst 11th place has a playoff with one of the teams that finished 2nd4th in k league 2

international context

in the current format of the afc champions league the competition is split into a west region think uae saudi arabia qatar iran and an east region the east region is dominated by three nations  korea china and japan australia who decided it wanted to be asian earlier this century has also had a bit of success

this year there will be two debutants from korea  gyeongnam fc and daegu fc its dufficult to predict how well these two will fare but if they can carry some form over to this year they could get out of the group stages at least

determining who has the strongest teams amongst the big three east asian nations is a difficult task and is hugely subjective im almost i say almost because obviously k league is best league of the opinion that theyre as close to equal as makes no difference korea has the most number of titles and the club with the most titles pohang steelers china have the highest coefficient japan has won the past two tournaments

in recent years china and japan have had a number of big star foreigner signings eg paulinho torres which are absent from the k league i believe this is due to japan having cash mainly coming from tv money and china having cash from well being china despite korea lagging financially all three nations have the same limit on foreign players three foreigners plus one from another afc country and so korean teams are still competitive due to the relative strength of their domestic players

while were on the topic of the champions league each of the big three east asian nations get 4 places total  2 or 3 to the group stages and 1 or 2 to the last qualifying playoff round before the group stages this playoff round is massively weighted in the big threes favour as they have to win just one home game when the weather is still genrally freezing cold against a team from a nation with a tropical climate i dont know of a korean club ever losing this playoff match

the afc cup is sometimes said to be the equivalent of uefas europa league but its not really comparable the afc cup is for the weaker asian nations only and korea arent allowed to enter

a really good resource for uptodate breaking news is an english version of a korean news outlet the sports category of yonhap newshttpsenynacokrsportsindex for example is great although youll be getting other sports news in there such as korean baseball football appears pretty regularly also the team that works on writing the articles dont seem to work weekends

tavern of the taeguk warriorshttpwwwtaegukwarriorscom has a lot of information mainly on the korean national team and tracks the progress of koreans playing in europe but covers the domestic club scene now and then

48 shades of footballhttps48shadesblogcom is a great english language podcast following korean football

the asian gamehttpswwwtheasiangamenet is another great english language podcast that doesnt specifically follow korean football but since they cover asian football theyll sometimes have indepth coverage of the korean clubs competing in the afc champions league as well as the korean national team

then of course theres rkleague with news and discussion and where you can ask questions to the community

highlights  watching live

all highlights from k league 1 matches are uploaded fairly promptly to the spotv youtube channelhttpswwwyoutubecomuserspotv spotv is a korean sports broadcaster they also upload content from the kbo baseball and the v league volleyball so youll have to scroll down until you see something saying k1 it helps if you know how korean letters sound phonetically to understand which teams are playing but you can also see which match a video is from the crests in the thumbnail the commentary will be in korean but each video is really good quality typically about 10 minutes long

if you watch to watch live the good news is that is very easy and basically free i have no idea whether any national broadcasters or streaming services around the world have k league rights but in korea itself essentially every thing is streamed on korean online behemoth navers platform the one caveat is that live streams are region locked so to access them youll need a vpn to get a korean ip address although some other asian countries also seem to have access i wont repeat what others have already written so heres a short guide to getting it workinghttpswwwredditcomrkleaguecomments7a3zpwkleaguetipsfordummies3icantwaittoget which also covers another route via the daum online portal or theres a comment in that thread which covers a more straightforward way by using the naver tv app

e parallels and differences between yi san and the red sleeve 

1 the red sleeve focuses mainly on the love story between yi san and royal noble consort uibin seong 

yi san also focuses mainly on the love story between yi san and royal noble consort uibin seong but because it has 77 episodes it also focuses on 

 the lifelong friendship between yi san daesu and sung songyeon

 songyeons struggles as she desires to rise from just being a damo to becoming a royal artist

 the discipline and training that king yeongjo puts the young crown prince yi san

 yi sans struggles as a crown prince with political intrigues and several assassination attempts against him orchestrated by the noron faction princess hwahan and queen jungsoon 

 yi sans reign as crown prince as regent and as king his political achievements such as establishing the kyujanggjak library and the construction of hwaseong fortress 

 yi sans relationships with politicians such as hong gookyoung and confucian scholars such as jeong yagjong 17601801 

 the persecution of catholics during king jeongjos reign

 the dynamic between songyeon and crown princess later queen hyoeui  between songyeon and lady hyegyeong and between queen hyoeui and lady hyegyeong

2 crown princess later queen hyoeui yi sans wife is a major character in yi san she supports and encourages 
songyeon into becoming yi sans concubine despite the opposition of yi sans mother lady hyegyeong 

in the red sleeve queen hyoeui is not depicted at all being mentioned only twice or thrice as queen kim or simply the queen 

3 in the red sleeve queen jungsoon is depicted as being supportive of yi san whenever it suits her she is primarily in conflict with princess hwawan

in yi san queen jungsoon is depicted as leading the noron faction and princess hwahan in trying to kill yi san or to depose him as crown prince

in the red sleeve conflict arises between yi san and queen jungsoon over her brother kim guijoo he doesnt appear in the drama but is mentioned in passing 

in yi san kim guijoo appears in several episodes starting in ep 23 where hes shown as the mastermind of an assassination attempt against yi san hong gookyoung discovers the attempt and saves yi san with daesus help

4 in the the red sleeve hong deokro aka hong gookyoung is depicted as having been assigned during his childhood by king yeongjo to be yi sans tutor in yi san hong gookyoung first appears in ep 10 as a tutor with the office of the crown prince with a side business of teaching people how to pass the civil service and military exams in ep 14 he meets and talks with yi san for the first time 

5 in ep 14 of the red sleeve yi san does not go to sookchang palace to consummate relations with hong deokros young sister who has become a royal noble consort after creating trouble in the royal observatory he goes back to his quarters where he finds deukim 

in ep 52 of yi san yi san does not go to the bedchambers of royal concubine hong sister of hong gookyoung on their wedding night instead he visits songyeon in the bureau of paintings 

6 in yi san hong gookyoungs sister fakes her pregnancy and later dies hong gookyoung then blames queen hyoeui for her death and attempts to assassinate her by poison leading to his dismissal and exile 

in the red sleeve hong deokro thinks his sister was poisoned by the court ladies upon orders of queen kim and thus he begins to kidnap the court ladies and pressure them to testify against queen kim

7 in the red sleeve deukim saves yi san by decoding the symbols provided by court lady park the double rings of lady hyegyeong and the tattoo on her back she finds out that the document of truth is hidden in the irworobongdo screen behind the kings throne 

in yi san songyeon saves yisan by finding crown prince sados letter hidden in the painting 

8 both the red sleeve and yi san depict in several episodes king yeongjo as he suffers from dementia 

did king yeongjo 16941776 of joseon dynasty korea suffer dementia during the last decade of his reignhttpswwwtandfonlinecomdoiabs1010800964704x20211936079afrjournalcodenjhn20 from journal of the history of the neurosciences basic and clinical perspectives volume 30 2021  issue 4 

king yeongjo the 21st king of joseon 18th century korea reigned during the prime years of the dynasty and was its oldest king despite his many accomplishments debate surrounds his reputed display of the symptoms of dementia during the last years of his life the king showed signs of dementia after 40 years of his regency in 1762 at the age of 69 years including disorientation cognitive impairment amnestic disorder and so on

prior to his death in 1776 25 meaningful dementia symptoms were recorded in the annals across a 10year period however despite indications of dementia the joseon dynasty supported him as a king and helped him retain his dignity until the end

9 in ep 17 of the red sleeve yi san king jeongjo tells his royal bodyguard that hes dissatisfied with the way the royal guards shoot the arrow 

in yi san ep 10 king yeongjo scolds yi san for the poor performance of his royal guards and challenges him to show leadership almost half of the episode shows yi san pressuring his guards to learn how to use the bow and arrow assigning more arrows to be shot each training session his guards resent the hard training so much that one of them burns down their quarters 

f miscellaneous backgrounders 

1 in ep 7 court lady seo is stunned when sees through a peep hole that deokim is changing her clothes in the room where yi san is taking a bath we know that shes thinking that deokim and yi san had sex after deokim leaves the room she holds her by the shoulders looks at her and then looks down after turning her eyes again at deokim she asks her if everythings all righthttpsimgurcom4dgrigu 

why did court lady seo look downwards before questioning deokim well she could just simply be checking if deokim is really all right imo however court lady seo looks downwards to see if deokim has flipped her skirt a sign that she had received yi sans grace in simple terms they had sex

in ep 7 3858 mark of jang ok jung live in love a 2013 historical drama starring kim taehee and yoo ahin jang ok jung overhears two court maids gossiping about a court maid who received the kings grace the night before they say that a court maid flips her skirt as a sign that she received the kings grace

2 i am the son of crown prince sado 

in ep 45 of yi san yi san is now king jeongjo he strikes fear among the court ministers who plotted against him when upon sitting on the throne for the first time he exclaims i am the son of crown prince sado these words are supposedly recorded in the annals of the joseon dynasty 

i was disappointed when the red sleeve didnt have this iconic scene when yi san became king in ep 13 i was thus pleasantly surprised by ep 16 when yi san exclaimed these words after royal noble consort hwabin insisted to queen dowager jungsoon that since crown prince sado was a traitor deokims father was by association also a traitor 

relevant resource about crown prince sado fiction vs history crown prince sados difficult history while the throne is accurate it misses complexities of a complicated relationshiphttpskoreajoongangdailyjoinscom20190210etcfictionvshistorycrownprincesadosdifficulthistorywhilethethroneisaccurateitmissescomplexitiesofacomplicatedrelationship3059182html korean joongang daily 

3 in ep 3 when deokim wants to know if king yeongjos mood is good or bad bokyeon tells her that hes in a bad mood because he washed his ears the 2015 movie the throne starring song kangho and yoo ahin explains at the 2242 mark what it means for the king to wash his ears if he has heard ominous words he rinses out his mouth and washes his ears before going to bed in order to dispel the bad luck 

4 several scenes in the red sleeve  show king yeongjo and king jeongjo yi san wearing eyeglasses in several scenes head court lady jo also wears eyeglasses 

this is historically inaccurate because robert neff a well respected scholar on korean history says in his article ensuring to be seenhttpsmkoreatimescokrpagesarticleaspnewsidx146292 that king jeongjo yi san was the first joseon king to wear eyeglasses

king jeongjo r 17761800 who may have been the first joseon monarch to wear glasses was faced with the dilemma of choosing whether to wear his glasses in front of his council or forego them and basically be unable to read the documents before him he apparently chose to wear them 

neff also says when the american newspaperman frank carpenter had an audience with the king in december 1888 he was gently reminded that if he did not want to appear impertinent before the monarch then he should remove his spectacles as they were seen as an emblem of rank 

5 in several scenes such as in ep 2 of the red sleeve yi san uses a fan so that deokim wont recognize himhttpsimgurcomxqlkd88

if you have seen saimdang lights diaryhttpswwwredditcomrkdramacommentshfmcpwhistoricalpaintingsdepictedinsaimdanglights you will remember that in ep 11 while fighting off hwieumdangs men yigyeom stops the men from continuing to attack him by opening his fan the men recognize that yigyeom is a member of the royal family because of his fanhttpsimgurcomfmtev4v

from traditional fans do more than just help cool off during summerhttpswwwkoreanetnewsfocushonoraryreportersviewarticleid200329 koreanet the number of spokes showed the difference in class of joseon society at the time the highest number of 50 was reserved for fans of the royal family aristocrats had those with a maximum of 40 and the commoners less than that 

6 in ep 3 of the red sleeve yi san gets into trouble with king yeongjo when he and his men hunt down the tiger which has been killing people and which has gone into the palace where the court maids are having their festival this episode may have been inspired by an 1893 incident from the tiger huntershttpsmkoreatimescokrpagesarticleaspnewsidx276925 the korea times 2019 by robert neff 

some of koreas most dangerous and ferocious tigers were those that dwelt on the slopes of inwangsan just outside the seoul city walls these tigers often preyed on woodcutters and firewood merchants traveling to and from goyang city  especially at muakjae pass in 1893 at least one tiger was reported to be prowling about gyeongbok palace  probably hunting the tame little deer kept there there are even claims probably exaggerated of tigers stalking seouls gloomy unlit streets  the silence shattered by the screams of their unwary victims fighting a losing battle for their lives

7 in ep 2 of the red sleeve deokim begins working at the crown princes library there she sees a painting on the wall of a yellow cat playing with a butterfly that painting is based on the famous painting yellow cat romps with a butterfly by kim hongdo 17451806 a famous painter during the joseon dynastyhttpsimgurcomipxklvy his most famous painting is the nineteen taoist immortals 

from finding the meaning in whimsical traditional art korea joongang daily in ancient korea cats represented the age of 70 while butterflies stood for the age of 80 

8 ep 8 of the red sleeve introduces gwanghang palace a secret organization of court ladies led by head court lady jo 

from fans are angry at the red sleeve as it ruined the original novel its original romance genrehttpskbizoomcomfansareangryattheredsleeveasitruinedtheoriginalnovelitsoriginalromancegenre 

 as the series is reaching its second half when the romance between the two main characters lee san who finally realizes his love for seong deokim and decided to pursue her and seong deokim who tries to push him away even though she knows his feelings is supposed to be built up the red sleeve poured cold water on the audience by bringing out the court ladies secret organization gwanghang palace 

this detail was not even in the original novel 

the writer of the red sleeve may have based gwanghang palace on the 2007 movie shadows in the palacehttpsmyoutubecomwatchvx9wa81vbiqu directed by kim meejung the mystery thriller is a fictionalized account of gungnyeo court maids during south koreas joseon era the movie with yoon seah of sky castle in the cast won awards and garnered numerous nominations from blue dragon film awards korean film awards grand bell awards baeksang arts awards etc 

9 persimmons marinated crabs and the musin rebellion against king yeongjo 

in ep 10 of the red sleeve king yeongjo becomes outraged during the banquet when somebody served him persimmons and marinated crabs foods which he supposedly used to poison his brother king gyeongjong in his anger he tries to strike hong hyebin lady hyegyeong with a hot poker

buan north jeolla province  centuriesold buddhist culture meets picturesque nature in buan north jeolla province

our trip to the county situated about 200 kilometers southwest of seoul with a population of 50000 begins at naeso temple  one of the oldest surviving buddhist monasteries in korea

it is at this historic site built in 633 during the late baekje era 18 bce660 ce that hundreds gathered on jan 9 to celebrate the new designation of the temples 800yearold bronze bell as a national treasure

produced in 1222 the relic is the largest among the surviving bronze bells from the late goryeo kingdom 9181392 standing at a height of 103 centimeters and weighing approximately 420 kilograms

originally enshrined at the nowgone cheongnim temple in south chungcheong province it was moved to its current location in 1850 the elevation of its cultural heritage status to a national treasure comes six decades after it was initially designated as a treasure in 1963

the bell is considered a prime masterpiece of its kind for displaying the intricacy of goryeoera craftsmanship while inheriting the technical and aesthetic traditions of the unified silla kingdom 668935 according to choi eungchon head of the cultural heritage administration cha who is also a bronze bell specialist

in addition to its aesthetic qualities the relics exceptional academic value lies in that it is engraved with clear information on the production period the location of its enshrinement as well as the name of its master craftsman  han jungseo he said during the ceremony

at its top a dynamically carved yongnyu a loop used to hang the bell takes the shape of a dragon about to soar through the air its shoulder and dangjwa the bells striking point are adorned with blooming lotus patterns another striking feature includes bands of vines encircling the bells crown and sound bow

the temple noted that the bell was struck as recently as the late 1980s before it was set aside for preservation

just a halfhour ride away from naeso temple nestled in the verdant valleys is another monastery gaeam temple

this temple was established in 634 just a year after its neighbor before it was razed and rebuilt in 1636 following the 159298 japanese invasions of korea

similar to naeso temple gaeam houses several statedesignated treasures including the daeungjeon main buddha hall and the 18thcentury yeongsanhoe buddhist hanging scroll painting along with its original drawing

the 30meterhigh jikso waterfall is nestled deep within the mountains and volcanic rock formations in byeonsanbando national park in buan north jeolla provincehttpspreviewredditcjm8zcic4ihc1pngwidth740formatpngautowebpsc85d9e0e24f16cbf6b8f6f22fa4a4037405b60eb

x200b

in addition to the centuriesold buddhist architecture there are plenty of showstoppers scattered across buan for nature lovers

among them perhaps the bestknown is the jikso waterfall with its roar echoing through the mountains and volcanic rock formations in byeonsanbando national park

standing at a height of 30 meters the fall earns its name jikso due to a distinctive feature  its water cascading directly into a round basin below without getting caught on any rocks

this aquatic spectacle has been the subject of a number of literary works and paintings during the 13921910 joseon era including the 18thcentury literati painter kang sehwangs scenes in buan prefecture

theres also a mythical touch to this natural wonder local legend has it that a dragon is coiled up in the pool beneath the waterfall in the past in times of drought magistrates would convene at this site to perform rain rituals

in the surrounding area visitors can marvel at the columnar jointing of volcanic rocks  a geological phenomenon where rapidly cooled lava has shaped an array of rocks resembling polygonal pillars

 buans gomso salt field is one of the few remaining natural salt production sites in korea httpspreviewreddit2h51158h4ihc1pngwidth740formatpngautowebpsa32f9fdc69bf7e290466b6155946cee6c4b1d053

x200b

after leaving the mountainous byeonsanbando national park one can encounter gomso salt field one of the few natural salt production sites left in the country

during joseon salt farming in the region relied on the jayeom method which involved boiling ocean water in kilns however in the later days of the japanese colonial rule 191045 this traditional practice gave way to the current cheonilyeom method also known as solar sea salt

the mineralrich seawater in the area lends a flavorful and mildly sweet taste to the salt that is harvested between march and october

naturally the county is renowned for its diverse array of jeotgal salted seafood dishes and even unique specialties like steamed buns seasoned with local salt

 a coastline view from the jungmakdong archaeological site in buan north jeolla province httpspreviewredditjyqn9b9l4ihc1pngwidth740formatpngautowebps107b62d70a7345b48b2adf5ca77926c64ff687a2

 

after savoring the scenery why not venture to the westernmost tip of buan which stretches into the west sea

for over a millennium the jungmakdong archaeological site had been a strategic location for maritime exchanges in east asia linking the southwestern coast of korea with japan and china

perched on a coastal cliff this place was a frequent gathering spot for traveling fishermen and merchants who held rituals to pray for safe voyages and bountiful catches notably from the three kingdoms era 57 bce668 ce through the joseon period

excavations conducted in 1992 revealed a trove of ancient artifacts used in these rites ranging from chinese porcelain and metalware to japanese vessels

even today local people involved in the fishing industry continue to perform annual rituals for grandmother gaeyang the guardian deity of the seas at the suseongdang shrine on site

for those familiar with the tale of shim cheong it may be surprising to learn of the areas possible connection to the classic korean folk story

the waters off the jungmakdong archaeological site could be where the filial daughter shim sacrificed herself to the sea god to help her blind father regain his sight at least thats what some historians at yonsei university suggest

jeolla,after the rain stopped,NO BODY
jeolla,best casual cycling destinations outside of seoul,"hey everyone

my wife and i recently purchased some touring bikes for the last however many years we have been doing around 100 km or so on weekends using the seoul city bikes and finally decided to upgrade to something more personal were planning on following the seoul to busan path sometime this autumn but in the meantime im trying to figure out some cities outside of seoul that would be fun places to go and cycle around over the occasional weekend

our plan is to just toss our bikes on the earliest bus heading out towards whatever our destination would be and then bike around after arriving and just explore and soak in the sights likely would ride around 3040 km a day over 12 days

ive traveled outside of seoul a bit jeollado gangwondo jeonju nearby daejon but i cannot immediately think of some ideal locations to cycle around all day that have pretty trails and small stops  restaurants cafes and the like  along the way beyond that those are some large regions and i dont know them well enough to pin down smaller townsneighborhoods to focus on for such a trip

i cant find any good resources for the answers im seeking as most of the english resources i came across just discuss the larger wellknown and wellworn trails and bike paths so i thought id turn to the community living here and see if anyone has any suggestions theyd like to share

my wife prefers to avoid riding along larger roads and both of us would like somewhere that isnt too heavy with traffic smaller towns are fine even better would be an area where we can hop between townsneighborhoods and get some country riding in were really doing this to just get out and explore some pretty areas that wed normally not visit and combining that with riding around as the weather cools a bit sounds pretty idyllic

anyway understand this may be a bit of a specific request but if anyone out there has something that comes to mind or a place theyve gone out to for a similar experience id really appreciate the information

hope you are all doing well out there and thanks in advance"
jeolla,youns kitchen transforms with new focus for upcoming season,"youns kitchen is returning as youns stay literal title

on december 22 a source frm tvn confirmed that the network is launching youns stay which is directed by na young suk and kim se hee it will be a reality program set in a hanok traditional korean home in south jeolla province

the main cast of youns kitchen returns for this new spin on the format with youn yuh jung lee seo jin jung yu mi and park seo joon taking part as previously confirmed theyre joined by choi woo shik who starred alongside jung yu mi this year in na young suks reality show summer vacation the cast of youns stay recently wrapped up filming in the county of gurye

the first season of youns kitchen featured the stars opening a restaurant on an island in bali indonesia and in the second season they did so on the spanish island of tenerife due to covid19 the show decided to film in korea this year

tvn stated there is not much travel happening between countries due to covid19 but there are foreigners who have come to korea during the covid19 period after being appointed by their business or for their studies and they are not able to enjoy the atmosphere of korea we wanted to create an opportunity for them to experience koreas charms and the beauty of hanok while doing a homestay in a hanok

youns stay is slated for a january premiere

jeolla,ive already checked online and couldnt find anything but  are there intercity bus passes in s korea the equivalent of the korail pass,edit we plan to do a lot of travelling in the south but the rail connections between jeolla and gyeongsang seem sparse so bus it is
jeolla,reached people group of the week  koreans of south korea,"its that time of year again when we are forced to sit at a table and tell our families things we are thankful for but what i am thankful for is groups that became reached after thousands of years of being unreached today we are doing a rather obvious one the koreans im posting this one because south korea sends the second highest number of missionaries around the world how awesome is that and up until around 1800 they never had access to the gospel

how were they reached

catholicism was first introduced during the late joseon dynasty period by confucian scholars who encountered it in china in 1603 yi gwangjeong korean diplomat returned from beijing carrying several theological books written by matteo ricci an italian jesuit missionary to china he began disseminating the information in the books and the first seeds of christianity were sown in 1758 king yeongjo of joseon officially outlawed catholicism as an evil practice catholicism was reintroduced in 1785 by yi seunghun and since then french and chinese catholic priests were invited by the korean christians  
  
joseon royalty saw the new religion as a subversive influence and persecuted its earliest followers in korea culminating in the catholic persecution of 1866 in which 8000 catholics across the country were killed including nine french missionary priests the opening of korea to the outside world in the late nineteenth century brought religious toleration for the remaining catholics and also introduced protestantism via american missionaries beginning in 1884 the first protestant church in korea was established by seo sangryun and the first protestant missionary to enter korea was horace newton allen both events occurring in 1884 horace allen was a north presbyterian missionary who became an american diplomat he served in korea until 1905 by which time he had been joined by many others  
  
the growth of both denominations was gradual before 1945 in that year approximately 2 of the population was christian rapid growth ensued after the war when korea was freed from japanese occupation by the allies by 1991 184 of the population 80 million was protestant and 67 25 million was catholic wikipediahttpsenwikipediaorgwikichristianityinkorea

and then this

the christian missionaries who arrived in the 1800s and following have contributed much to the health education and general wellbeing of the south koreans christians were vocal in their support of the liberation of the korean peninsula from imperialist japan the establishment of schools hospitals orphanages and universities by the christians paved the way for the modernization of south korea joshua projecthttpsjoshuaprojectnetpeoplegroups12795ks

it is estimated that 30 of koreans in south korean are christian

what are they like

typical qualification that all people groups cant be summed up in small paragraphs and this is an over generalization

south korea boasts asias third largest economy exports of electronics automobiles and machinery allow the country to afford many conveniences of the modern world high rates of cable andor satellite television usage and highspeed internet connectivity make south korean a member of the cutting edge technology users of the world the country is also credited with pioneering the television via mobile devices and internet revolution  
  
distinct regional differences in culture and politics exist among the south koreans the most important regional difference is between the gyeongsang region in the southeast and the jeolla region in the southwest the two regions maintain a rivalry that reaches back to the fourth century ad the rivalry originated from a struggle for control of the peninsula interregional marriages are rare and travel between the regions in sparce despite a major highway connecting the regions since 1984 constructed for the specific reason of increasing interregional travel the highway has not served to improve visitation or commerce between the regions  
  
the political power elite have come largely from the gyeongsang region and consequently this region has benefitted most from government development assistance in contrast the jeolla region has remained comparatively rural and undeveloped  
  
regional stereotypes like regional dialects have been breaking down under the influence of centralized education nationwide media and several decades of population movement since the korean war stereotypes remain important in the eyes of many south koreans however each region has its own stereotypical beliefs about the other regions these beliefs may or may not be based in truth and accuracy joshua projecthttpsjoshuaprojectnetpeoplegroups12795ks

history lesson

the korean peninsula was inhabited as early as the lower paleolithic period the history of korea begins with the founding of joseon also known as gojoseon or old joseon to differentiate it with the 14th century dynasty in 2333 bce by dangun according to koreas foundation mythology gojoseon was noted in chinese records in the early 7th century gojoseon expanded until it controlled the northern korean peninsula and parts of manchuria gija joseon was purportedly founded in the 12th century bce but its existence and role have been controversial in the modern era in 108 bce the han dynasty defeated wiman joseon and installed four commanderies in the northern korean peninsula three of the commanderies fell or retreated westward within a few decades as lelang commandery was destroyed and rebuilt around this time the place gradually moved toward liaodong thus its force was diminished and it only served as a trade center until it was conquered by goguryeo in 313 wikipediahttpsenwikipediaorgwikichristianityinkorea

what do they believe

the dominant religions of south korea are christianity and buddhism despite the fact that most of the population express no particular affiliation with a religion south korea has the third largest number of professing christians of all the east asian and southeast asian countries  
  
there is a great deal of ambiguity in the practice and adherence to the belief systems that exist in south korea many people see religion as an inherited trait as much or more so than a faith also many south koreans practice elements of several belief systems christianity is the only faith that maintains distinct lines between those who belong to the belief system for the other religions it can be difficult if not impossible to know who practices what  
  
the korean church has had amazing growth in numbers and influence it was founded on sound indigenous principles blessed with a succession of revivals refined by persecution and is now one of the foremost in the world for missions vision its presence is highly visible every level of society has been impacted and growth has been remarkable of the 11 largest megacongregations in the world 10 are in the one city of seoul seoul also hosts the largest pentecostal presbyterian and methodist congregations in the world and the secondlargest baptist with over 15000 missionaries the korean church sends the secondhighest number of crosscultural workers to other parts of the world  joshua projecthttpsjoshuaprojectnetpeoplegroups12795ks

how can we pray for them

 pray that god will ignite passion for him and his word in the local christians
 pray they will evangelize the nation with the gospel of jesus christ
 pray they will spread the gospel and distribute bibles to oppressed nations in their region
 praise god for the amazing missionary vision of the korean church ask god to continue to raise up korean missionaries to go to the ends of the earth
 thank the lord for obedient servants who went to preach the good news
 thank the lord for a people group nestled in an area with so much unbelief surrounding it
 thank the lord for his constant provision to these people and to the missionaries that reached them
 pray for our nation the united states that we christians can learn to come alongside our hurting brothers and sisters and learn to carry one anothers burdens in a more christlike manner than we have done historically
 pray that in this time of chaos and panic that the needs of the unreached are not forgotten by the church pray that our hearts continue to ache to see the unreached hear the good news

brothers my hearts desire and prayer to god for them is that they may be saved romans 101

jeolla,summer school in korea seoul busan useful for normal language school as well,"ive been meaning to type this up for a while but never really found the energy today i got really so annoyed with one of busans unis so rather than fume over it i figure id use the energy in writing an information post so that no one will ever have to suffer like i am suffering right now this post deals with how to apply to summer programs at universities in korea and will be divided into two parts 1 what type of program are you looking for and 2 which regionuniversity should you choose

note i attended yonsei li attending pknu li waseda li

further note those who are here for normal language programs scroll down to language institute and start reading from there

nbsp

1 what type of program are you looking for summer school v language institute
one university can and usually does run two types of summer programs 


nbsp

summer school
the first type of program are a mix of general education korean culture and a bit of korean language curriculum summer school these schools usually have a slew of englishtaught programs to choose from culture in korea business in modern society etc and are extremely foreignerfriendly they provide dormitories and catered food in the dormitories there is usually a barrage of field trips and summer buddies available fun fact usually a few months before the program the school will send out a flyer to recruit summer buddies from the existing university students eager to practice their english they will have fun activities kpop dance cooking in korea taekwondo available these programs usually incorporate a threehour language class in the morning tailored for beginners and lowintermediates  

nbsp

i would reccommend these programs for people who

 dont mind paying a bit more money for safety and certainty
 want to make friends hang out in the city in a primarily englishspeaking environment
 hate uncertainty

nbsp

if you are applying to a summer school congratulations it is extremely easy to apply for a summer school most universities have a separate portal run exclusively in english for these schools and you should have almost no difficulty in locating the relevant portal i suggest using keywords like uni name international summer school a quick search using those terms gives me yonsei international summer school pnu summer school immediately 

nbsp
  
you must start checking these portals around january of the year that you wish to apply the programs will only upload concrete details around january if you want information earlier you can email the contact persons or you can look at previous years there is usually a 20 early bird discount applications proper can open as early as april and end as late as end may there is sometimes a discount up to 2030 for returning students students of alumni etc

nbsp
  
these courses appeared to be targeted at rich foreigners the prices all appear in usd so its extremely worthwhile to check out the discounts i reccommend summer schools for those younger students 18ish especially this is a very safe environment you will have relatively good english staff support and you are likely to make friends more easily this is probably also more fun for the clubberstravellers who are just looking for a fun time in korea with korean culture


nbsp


language institute
the second type of program is the korean language program im going to be extremely accurate here and say that most universities actually offer four different types of summer programs which can be divided into summer school 1 korean language 3

 summer school 4  6 weeks as discussed above
 regular summer 10 weeks  usually taken by students as part of their spring fall winter course but outsiders like us can also apply most of these institutes also run spring summer fall winter courses these course are usually 10 weeks long and these are the hardest of hardcore students these students usually have been accepted to enter a korean university and before uni they are doing a course in the affiliated korean language institute branch to get fluency i hear that busan is flooded with chinese especially on this course the application period for this is very strict and starts the earliest among all summer programs usually march 
 special summer a 3  6 weeks usually targeted at us foreigners who want to be in korea for a decently long while but still have to go back to school in our home countries this is the program i will be addressing in this entire section on language institutes
 special summer b 2 weeks i forgot about this one when i wrote my original post usually this is for foreigners who are having a short stay in korea and want a fair mix of korean language korean culture and field tripping around the city dorms catering solid korean buddies are provided when it says two weeks its more like starts on a tuesday ends on the next friday so maybe 10 days sometimes i can admit that its a bit of a money squeezer but its worthwhile if you want to visit the university have a fun studentlike experience and leave if youre a casual tourist this is probably too restrictive for you as there are strict program timings and dorm curfew this might be good for potential students who want to get a taste of the university i will not be specifically targeting this program in my post however most of the points about special summer a are relatively applicable to b

nbsp

here are the various combinations for the special summer a and b programs

 uni only offers special summer a they only offer a long special summer course
 uni only offers special summer b they only offer a short special summer course
 uni offers both special summer a and b types yonsei and ewha did to my knowledge both special summer a and b are parked under the language institute branch they can be run concurrently ie at the same time but it will be two very different programs special summer b will focus more on going out and seeing the city and offering field trips it will be also slightly more expensive the more wellknown schools usually offer this program and its very common in seoul i havent seen this dual a and b combination in busanelsewhere they will stick to offering a single special summer course

nbsp

honestly can you see why its so frustrating to be very fair the variety of choice was good for me because i had a very strict calendar budget list of approved schools list of neighborhoods i wanted to be in so i did enjoy picking through the combinations to see what works best however the variety advantage is far outweighed by the sheer amount of bloody effort it is to extract this information from each university youre looking for the language site then looking to see if there are different programs then comparing costs and timings across the programs then remember that all this information is usually higgeldypiggeldy everywhere you have to piece it together there is no sweet and simple comparison table

nbsp

still my advice is to do your research and post it on reddit after please for the love of everything yonsei was literally amazing it can be quite worthwhile to put in the effort to understand what youre signing up for and hey ive already saved you like 70 of the agonising pain which is figuring out that a single school can run up to four different summer programs all the best guys

nbsp

special summer a

okay i will now continue talking about special summer a this program is just hardcore learning korean the nicer universities yonsei will have 4 hour korean classes in the morning 9am  1pm leaving your afternoons free for exploring the others will have legitimate 6 hour korean classes 9am  12pm 2pm  5pm and you will have the nights for yourself the universities usually throw in the fortnightly cultural activity pottery kpop dance and a single field trip

nbsp

i would reccommend this program to people who

 really are studying korean
 are comfortable hanging out with gyopos
 are okay with endless crying uncertainty fear and doubt constant regret or have parents that speak korean

nbsp

if you are applying for this program gird yourself this will be one of the worst experiences of your life this is like choosing a university but all the universities have pages in a foreign language and all the sites are hiddenbrokenare listed on google as a malicious site that will steal your data it is almost impossible to find out who to contact for assistance and you must wait three weeks for the reply

nbsp

how do you find the korean language program the easiest way is as follows

 first find the name of the summer school program you now know what you are not looking for 
 now google any combination of uni name international summer korean language institute a quick search gives me yonsei kli and leipusan fifth result and the website title is not in english you will have to search hard these institutes usually have a facebook page their names are sometimes cited in official tourism boards and they have a website name that will include the university name follow your instincts and just keep clicking on anything that gives you korean language institute
 and now the difficult part you have managed to find out the language institute sites of three different universities for comparison how do you locate the actual program

nbsp

this differs from site to site try headers like summer special program korean language special program there is usually a feed of announcements think of a very sterile clean wall of single line announcements somewhere you are looking for an announcement which says somewhere summer special program 2018 open the official facebook group of the institute is also a pretty good bet they will usually post the program details there

nbsp

this is especially tricky because often these announcements are in korean sometimes there will be two separate feeds one in english and one in korean the english one will almost always have some announcements missing the feed will also have a majority of announcements for regular summer classes

nbsp

you will want to pull out information from the previous years because the time cost and program will roughly follow the same pattern theres usually a 20 early bird discount and further discounts for alumni returning students etc email the course coordinator if you have doubts there is no better source of information than the person organising this program the course coordinator may not be fluent in english so use simple english and make sure to attach links of previous years programs so the coordinator knows exactly which course you are refering to again this information for previous programs will be found mainly on the facebook and the announcement feed but will usually be scattered around like birdseed google sometimes turns up good results for me 

nbsp

but great news when you find the information you want its always in pdf format usually in four versions chinese japanese english korean so just keep scrolling down and clearly lists out accomodation catering day to day program this is basically the motherlode this is your guide to everything you just need to find this pdf

nbsp

application time when do applications start usually the information comes out january  february applications are in may again email the course coordinator if you have any doubts

nbsp

i reccommend this program for people interested in korean language for real fun fact because the barrier to finding this forsaken program is so high i feel that most people you meet here are really interested in korean language and will have some background in it or they are rich children of gyopos overseas koreans usually american gyopos and they didnt want to attend the course but their mother signed them up for it they easily speak conversational korean at home but may not be able to readwrite korean 

nbsp

it happened that i made more friends with the more wealthy kids so i can talk more about that set honestly the people you meet are quite fun even the ones i wasnt close to they were really interesting and theyd know the best places yeah my aunt told me where to eat or have relatives staying in jeju and would be planning a trip there and theyre really comfortable ordering food and shopping and all theres a fair mix of the clubbers the intense kpoppers hi thats me the studious students the holiday rich kids etc the teachers are usually great too because they know that we wanna learn koreanare already fluent in korean so the joking and classroom activity is rowdy and fun i loved it made two of my best friends there and we had the kind of fun that you can only have when you speak literally the worst mangled korean and you actually can read and do normal stuff that tourists dont because language 

nbsp

alright ill do a quick rundown of the different schools seoul busan others i just had my lunch so now lets dive right back into

nbsp

2 which regionuniversity should you choose seoul v busan v others

as a rule summer school is its own kettle of fish and has its separate site which i will identify as eg yonsei summer school link the other three programs will be parked somewhere under the language institute site which i will identify as eg yonsei kli link

disclaimer im sure that the summer links are accurate im only fairly sure that the korean language institute sites are accurate this is because the kli sites are really hard to find and sometimes change addresses please confirm with your own efforts

further disclaimer this is not an exhaustive list there are more universities in korea that offer such programs there are also privately run language institutes ie not universities these are forprofit independent language centers which offer programs im just listing the ones i feel are the most common

nbsp

why should you pick seoul
i love seoul i wrote poems to seoul at 2am in the night seoul never sleeps the shopping the shopping is actually insane the kpop if youre coming here to try and watch a concert or any other kpoprelated thing come to seoul amusement parks no beaches if you want beaches busan relatively great cultural experiences food is pretty diverse although i hear that the southwest region of jeolla compared to the northwest region of seoul has the best food in korea likeminded friends hongdae i mean most of you will go to seoul and youre absolutely right just go

nbsp

which university should you pick in seoul
the first thing you need to do is to plot out on a map where all the universities are in seoul then plot out on the same map where the major entertainment districts are think about what you want if you want a intensely strong clubbing partying fun vibe you should locate yourself in what i labelled above as the hongdae sector five  ten minutes from hongdae basically anywhere near insadong is more cultural fun its got great food tea houses youre relatively close by the palaces theater disctrict and shopping district myeongdong i hear that hanyang is good if you want to hang out in gangnam for the uninitiated gangnam and hongdae which are the two biggest party districts are about 1 hour  apart from each other by train so you will have to pick one to live in 

nbsp

i want to do a quick disclaimer on my mountains of nowheres the kodae mountain of nowhere anam is actually a rather nice university district which is a halfhour or so ride from gangnam one of my friends wanted to go to a famous dance studio near kodae so she picked kodae instead i have not visited snu to my limited knowledge the snu mountain of nowhere is actually a mountain and it really is in the middle of nowhere i do hear that the sk universities have a good campus vibe personally it just wasnt the thing i was looking out for but it might be for some of you

nbsp

which university has good quality teaching i suggest you click around reddit for personal experiences and reviews i have only been to yonsei so i can only feedback on yonsei i adored yonsei but i had the luck of getting the head of the department to teach my class i selfstudy a lot so i was pickier about my social surroundings than the quality of the lessons 

nbsp

my opinion handsdown yonsei i wanted to go to a sky university for the branding i wanted to be pretty near social life i did consider ewha but i thought there would be a lot of guys applying to ewha to meet girls girls only school if branding is not important to you i suggest that you click around the nonsky universities because they usually are cheaper and still welllocated i did tons of research on at least eleven of the seoul universities even though i was quite sure it was going to be yonsei because i needed to justify why i was picking yonsei to my sponsor dont limit yourself

nbsp

and thats it for seoul

disclaimer by the way it is very common that the sites are down for no reason at all the sites have switched you are using a browser which is not compatible the server just doesnt feel like it youre accessing from the wrong country sometimes i even get a warning this site may be trying to steal your info honestly ive just given up just try on different days different browsers different devices never wait for the problem to solve itself because it wont try and find another way into the site

nbsp

why should you pick busan
okay like this is completely a personal preference but im dead for the busan accent that is literally my reason numbers 1 through 5 other than that busans got good seafood beautiful sunny beaches if you want to take a trip to jeju its very convenient busan has a lot of political and historical seriously im a bit of a nerd and it is considerable significance its near the ancient palaces up in gyeongju mainly the accent

nbsp

remember that busan is 5 hours away from seoul and expensive so if you want to spend most of your time in seoul base yourself in seoul dont imagine that youll be taking the train up and down your friends may not want to and youll end up going alone 

nbsp

which university should you pick in busan
its basically a tossup between pnu and pknu if youre going on exchange i hear donga is also an option and its a nice clean university town pnu is a bit too far up for me pknu to me is perfectly located ill come back and update about what to do in busan once ive finished attending 2018 pknu summer hit me up via private message if youre taking that course too


nbsp

others

 kaist summer school in daejeon httpsummerkaistackr
 chonbuk national university in jeolla
 others

nbsp

should you pick universities outside of seoul and busan
if you are interested yes the other two i have briefly considered are kaist for its ranking which i quickly dropped because the program doesnt focus on language it focuses on math and science and chonbuk national uni purely because i considered picking up the jeolla accent just for kicks and because i wanted to eat jeollas food but i think i found out chonbuk doesnt offer the summer timing i wanted

nbsp

if you have a specific accent or institution that you have interest in of course you should take a look i sincerely doubt that people will be looking outside of seoul and busan but i want to reassure the people who are looking for a comprehensive guide to summer school  yes it really is mostly about seoul and busan and i think thats all let me know if any of the links should be updated in the comments below"
jeolla,faith online debut showcase interview,"mc lee jin lj

members  julia jl harini hr ayuni ay elisah el jihye jh

 

lj welcome everyone to faiths debut showcase i am actress and host lee jin as their labelmate and former member of a girl group myself im more than glad to host this showcase for the 5 talented young girls that have a variety of talents to show please take care of them may i request faith to take the stage

faith  go on stage stand in a row

lj aw how pretty please girls introduce yourselves

jl sure we will greet for the first time ever now dul set

all uril midgo ppajyeollae tn will you trust us and fall for us  
annyeonghaseyo we are faith

lj of course we will trust and fall for you sit down here feel comfortable have you all settled

all yes sunbaenim

lj alright lets start with the introductions from eldest to youngest please

jl yes hello i am the eldest and the charismatic leader i am in charge of the main vocal position i am julia take care of me 

lj thank you julia next 

es yes hello i am in charge of the center and in charge of english i am elisah from the us take care of me 

lj elisah thank you very much 

hr hello im the main dancer with the charming eyes from indonesia harini take care of me

lj from indonesia wow im impressed by your korean pronounciation alright next 

jh hello i am the second main vocal with julia unnie and in charge of the atmosphere tn lighting up the mood i am kwon jihye take care of me 

lj such a bright person like you will always take care that the atmosphere is good the maknae now

ay hello everyone i am the maknae in charge of japanese the vitamin of the group and rapping im ayuni take care of me 



lj thanks a lot ayuni thanks you too girls alright its time to look at your new journey as faith can the leader introduce faith to us 

jl yes this is the leader julia faith is a vocal girl group consisting of us five members julia elisah harini jihye and ayuni and our concept is a more mature a little bit oldschool style unnielike and cool vocal group through our songs and our appearance we want people of all ages to remember groups in the 2000s who were not just pretty girls who sang and danced but also excelled at it and were all round entertainers beloved by everyone motioning to lee jin such as finkl sunbaenim for example 

lj smiles thats so sweet of you thank you so much it makes me happy to see children born after we debuted still remember us alright what are your strengths as a group and individually yes elisah

es yes elisah here as a group our strength are our vocals all 5 of us have distinct vocal colours and we harmonise well and create good synergy with each other while singing all five of us are very strong with our singing none of us here are bad even our weakest one ayuni can be first lead vocalist or second main main vocalist in any other group

lj i see thats great you mentioned vocal colours which im sure we will see soon in the performance of your debut song do you mind introducing each members vocal and their colour

es sure julia unnie has a voice which can be described with the colour dark purple she carries a lot of emotions with her heavy voice be it heartbreak motivation or girlyness because she is trained in rnb and vocal music she also has a distinct way of singing that reminds you of the olden days but still sounds very fresh today in fact she trained in america unnie and me met at the training facility in la actually 

my voice can be described with the colour blue its very refreshing easy going and is like a girl crush type i am also someone who can take on many voices to adjust to each song my training has been in pop songs since the beginning and i used to be in church choir  

harini has a very deep and heavy voice i would describe as the colour dark red while we were trainees we were joking that even when she sings a childrens song its like shes enchanting someone her background is in traditional indonesian music so she sometimes teaches us new vocal techniques they bring a lot of variety into our singing  

jihye has a voice that suits the colour yellow she is right now in college majoring in contemporary classical music she is a soprano with a voice thats perfect for musicals her voice is very light sunny and she can carry a lot of emotions she was actually casted while practicing an aria  

ayuni has a voice i can describe with light pink not as pink as a babys but pink enough to be girlish you know ayuni is from japan where many female singers have a kawaii style compared to them ayuni sounds very husky and girl crush but with us who have strong voices she sounds kawaii laughs she is the key to our balance in vocals and harmonies she can be powerful and cute at the same time 

lj well said elisah you seem to be good at speaking 

el thank you so much 

lj as elisah said your strength is vocals jihye what else do you want to stand out with 

jh yes this is jihye while many girl groups nowadays focus on showing off their style dancing and the performance we want to focus on our singing and reach out to all audiences through the stage also there are a lot of underage young idols debuting recently our maknae ayuni has turned 19 this year we wanted to make sure all of us are old enough to not only be responsible idols but also members of the society yeah we are idols but we all pay taxes laughs 

lj i hope you all do for many years to come now im curious to know the meaning of your groups name faith in korean that would translate to  what is the meaning behind it yes harini

hr umm yes this is harini we chose the english name faith for different reasons one its to symbolise that people can trust us when it comes to delivering a good performance and being good entertainers two the roots of vocal groups like us lie in gospel soul jazz and rnb music which came from churches in america through our name faith we want to pay a tribute to the origins 



lj thank you harini if i may ask you girls  are any of you christian

el jl jh raise hands 

lj oh correct elisah you had mentioned you sang in the church choir harini and ayuni if you are fine with answering are you religious 

hr im hindu in indonesia there are a lot of hindus 

ay im atheist i have not been raised with any religion sunbaenim are you religious

lj me im christian nice of you to ask on to the next question right for you ayuni you mentioned you were in charge of japanese elisah mentioned you came from japan did you have difficulties with adjusting to korean culture

ay yes this is ayuni i actually have come from japan i was born and brought up there but im korean by blood im a 3rd generation zainichi korean 3  my korean name is shin ayooni         tn  clear beautiful a gentle tender yoo girl child ni in japanese its kamishiraishi masayuki my greatgrandparents came to japan during the war and my grandparents made sure we dont lose our korean roots despite the discrimination we celebrated chuseok and wore hanbok for any festivities played yutnoli and called each other unnie and hyung we learnt to read korean newspapers and had contact with our korean cousins a lot and went to our hometown for holidays in that way coming to korea felt like me finally coming home to the place where i belong more than adjusting to a foreign culture 

lj oh i didnt know that you were a korean by blood apologies if my question made you feel like a foreigner 

ay its not a problem in fact i do consider myself a foreigner to seoul because i didnt grow up here and dont know the system in such a big city here i was born and brought up in fukuoka which is a small town compared to seoul or tokyo the first time i travelled in the seoul subway i was supposed to end up in apgujeongdong but ended up somewhere in sillimdong laughs

lj well i hope youre feeling more familiar in seoul now we do have an actual foreigner here  harini over to you how did you first hear about the korean idol industry and how was it for you coming to korea 

hr harini speaking i first heard about the idol industry at a young age  actually our family has been watching korean entertainment since a long time my family watched actress song hyekyo and actor lee minhos dramas my elder siblings listened to super junior and juwelry for me i became interested after seeing 2ne1 kara and big bang sunbaenim in 2009 when i was just 9 i also remember hearing about tara snsd after school and 4minute for us in indonesia apart from our local entertainment we watch a lot of international content dramas from turkey movies from india songs from korea so as a child that was good at dancing i naturally felt attracted to the korean idol world and dreamt of doing it myself

as for the second question the hardest thing was the excuse me i cant find th word not the weather but

lj climate

hr yes thank you climate i saw my first ever snow here in korea its really impressive like in the dramas but also really cold ive never worn a thick jacket or mittens in my life until i came here yeah that was the hardest part 

lj youll get used to it dont worry elisah on to you youre koreanamerican right how did you feel coming here 

el yes this is elisah i grew up in la where there is a very big korean community i was able to stay in touch with korean culture but as ayuni said living in seoul is different from visiting for a holiday for me more than adjusting i really wanted to blend in as much as i could so i learnt things like slang quicker its  because in america i felt like im an outsider because i looked asian so didnt want to be an outsider here too my korean name is choi sunah so i used to introduce myself like that when i came here first i wanted to feel as korean as possible even at the company i used that name i met the members as choi sunah they thought elisah is a stage name chuckles but its my birth name 

lj youve got really pretty names both western and korean be proud of it you know you have a special privilege of understanding both countries and cultures itll be valuable to you one day believe me i felt like saying this because i know a lot of people like you i live in america currently you know 

el oh you do thats so sweet of you sunbaenim thank you so much 

lj my pleasure sunahyah laughs moving on we have the korean js  jihye and julia looking at how impatient jihye is giggling jihye lets start with you this question is for you you are currently majoring in classical music why did you decide to join the idol world 

jh yes this is jihye i feel like by joining the idol industry i have the power to directly influence people more than as a soprano ive always wanted to connect to different people and learn more about the world and i feel like despite my training being meant for different purposes i can grow much more as a person if im an idol than when id be on stage as a soprano i also always had a forbidden love for hip hop but ill make sure to practice a lot of soprano vocals too especially musicals julia unnie is obsessed with them

lj thanks for the good transition jihye because this question for julia might go into the similar direction  julia you mentioned that you wanted to be all rounder entertainers what are your goals and aspirations in the wider entertainment field

jl yes this is julia is this for all the members aspirations or just mine 

lj just yours 

jl well for one apart from singing which is obviously my strength i feel like id do good on variety shows im good at telling stories in general and a lot of funny jazz has gone down in my life

lj sorry for the interruption but im too curious to not ask this  are you from jeolla province by any chance going by your word choice

jl yes i am i grew up in the outskirts of gwangju i have a very heavy satoori right i think i should switch to standard language

lj oh no im sorry dont hide it its really charming and suits you a lot i was just curious to know because i thought you were from seoul at first 

jl i do means ive adjusted well back to the question i recently am obsessed with musicals and act them out with jihye a lot i actually majored in applied vocal music so i cant wait until i feel im good enough to audition and find a career in musicals 



lj i hope to see you on stage soon another question to you julia as the leader what is one good and one not so good thing about the members when it comes to working together

jl julia speaking one good thing is that all 5 of us always know how to talk when we have any problems or difficulties we dont endure it quietly but speak up and solve it together and that makes our teamwork strong but one bad thing is that all the girls here including me put the team before themselves unconditionally that in itself is not a bad thing but it sometimes cane at the cost of their health that should not happen health is the most important thing and its ok to not be with the group once

lj well said i hope the members take good care of themselves i have a question to the maknae ayuni where would you like to see faith in lets say 5 years

ay ayuni here i would like to see faith winning a music show broadcast and winning an award i want us to have nice fans from all age groups and nationalities i would love to not only promote in japan indonesia and us where our members are from but also in other places like europe hong kong and so on 



lj alright thank you before we come to your debut song let me give you the opportunity to say your thanks to whomever you feel like saying it from the leader on please 

jl julia here first of all id like to thank my parents for believing and trusting me to take this career path our ceo who is also our pdnim who is not only kind but gave us a lot of freedom and made sure to listen to each of us she encouraged us and treated us and our staff like her own family 

el i would also like to thank all our fellow trainees whom we trained with but sadly left before we debuted we are the last ones standing you know we had a lot of fun and i hope we can meet in a music show as idols i also want to thank my teachers and our trainers without their help we wouldnt have been here

hr i would like to thank all of those back home that encouraged me and strengthened me to be an idol especially our vocal ssaem also a big thanks to julia unnie and her family because without them i wouldnt have survived here in korea her parents took me in like their daughter im so grateful to them

jl take them if you want harini id be happy to give them to you

everyone  laughs

lj thanks harini jihye 

jh id also like to thank my parents as well as my brother who came to seoul with me and stayed im a very shy person so i also want to say thanks to lisa unnie and julia unnie for taking care of me 

lj excuse me for the interruption who is lisa

el yes elisah here our album is named blind faith which means trusting someone without thinking yourself its a signal to blindly trust us and listen to our album its a full album with fourteen songs ranging from ballads to hip hop songs all these songs have in common that they are reminiscent of music in the 2000s it might sound like theyre out of style but they have a 2021 flavour to them too 

lj thanks elisah ayuni whats a special point to look out for in the album 

ay ayuni here one point is that we all wrote the lyrics for chase which is actually a remake of an anime ost the lyrics are in korean japanese english and bahasa indonesia indonesian language another point to look out for is the song blind faith and the song girls on top which is also a remake of boa sunbaenims song these are old school hip hop dance and rap song where lisa unnie harini unnie and i can show off our rap and our dancing while in yeah butterfly thousand days towards me and in other tracks jihye unnie and julia unnie lead us with their vocals

 fc seoul won their playoff against k league 2s busan ipark  
 seongnam fc were promoted from k league 2  
 ulsan won their champions league playoff and are in the group stages

its impossible to write a concise summary of the 2018 season  you can get some of the details from the club guide below  but one of the most interesting stories actually comes from k league 2

for context you need to understand a bit about military service for footballers rather than take 2 years out of their career to serve in the military or do some kind of eg desk job service players can join one of two military football teams that play in the k league in k league 1 there is sangju sangmu and in k league 2 there is asan mugunghwa every player in these two teams is on loan for two years from another club in the k league sangju sangu is affiliated with the normal military whilst asan mugunghwa is affiliated with the police serving in the auxilliary police force is another way to do your service

the korean government recently decided to abolish the auxilliary police force by 2023 the police however decided to already wind down their sports teams putting an immediate halt on recruiting players and disbanding the teams in 2019

now the champions of k league 2 last season were asan mugunghwa they were in line for direct promotion to k league 1 to compete in the k league you need to have at least 20 players but by the time the next season started asan would only have 14 players as the loan deals ran out the league gave asan a deadline in november to submit a recruitment plan which they failed to do and so the promotion spot passed to secondplaced seongnam fc although that deadline and hence promotion was missed asan have how submitted a recruitment plan that would see their 14 serving players be supplemented by new signings that indicates the club will transition to an cityowned club with the help of the asan government

funnily or depressingly this is not the first time police fc won k league 2 and missed out on promotion  in 2016 ansan mugunghwa were crowned champions but at the end of that year moved from ansan to asan in line with the leagues policies they were registered as a brand new club

k league 1 club guide

clubs can have up to three foreign players in their squad plus an extra one from another afc nation although rare a player with north korea citizenship is not considered foreign most of those foreign places are taken by brazilians or players from the former yugoslavia eg k league veteran dejan damjanovic the exception to the foreigner rule is the goalkeeper  korean goalkeepers in the 90s were just so bad that a block on recruiting foreign goalieshttpwwwkleagueunitedcom201703foreigngoalkeepersinfavourofhtml was put in place to help encourage development of domestic talent it seems to have worked with korean goalkeepers often being signed abroad in asia at least

there is also a requirement to have u23 players fielded and on the bench with a failure to meet this impacting the number of substitutes that can be made article 30httpswwwkleaguecomaboutcompetition of the league rules

youll notice some of the clubs have a korean chaebol in their team name and even if its not in the name they may still be owned by a corporation behind the scenes this sounds very odd if youre not familiar with it but it is extremely common in japan china and korea it may just be a symptom of some of the teams being relatively recentlyfounded and perhaps isnt that unusual these days think red bull city group majority shareholders in the west however the number of citizen clubs owned by the local city or provincial government is on the rise  gyeongnam fc is one example

a lot of clubs probably like to think they have a derby with fc seoul because well its seoul but the  biggest and probably considered the national derby is the super match  between fc seoul and suwon samsung bluewings montenegrin damjanovic known simply as dejan formerly of seoul and now playing for suwon is the top scorer in this fixture

heres the clubs by last seasons standing and since crests are a bit unstable on reddit at the moment heres an imgur album of all club crests and corresponding home kits for the 2019 seasonhttpimgurcomaw8dbla5

jeonbuk hyundai motors

jeonbuk are the dominant team in korea and one the of the teams you dont want to face in the champions league whoever you are theyve now won 4 out of the last 5 k league 1 titles and a most recent champions league title in 2016

their rise to power over the last decade has been overseen by long term manager choi kanghee choi left at the end of last season to tianjin quanjintianhai daliang yifang fc in china korea seems to have a thing for portuguese managers these days and his replacement is one jos morais morais was assistant manager to jos mourinho for a period but as manager proper hes been a bit shit he was at two clubs in 2018 which included ushering barnsley into relegation to english league one how jeonbuk will fare after choi remains to be seen

although jeonbuk cruised to the league title it would be difficult to call their season an outright success due to a horrendous 15 mins at the end of the second half in a home match against suwon in the champions league quarterfinal they turned the 3 goal deficit around in the seond leg when they travelled to suwon but went out on penalties 

gyeongnam fc

gyeongnam were only promoted from k league 2 the previous season so coming second in k league 1 is something special top scorer in the league marco played his part with 26 goals

gyeongnam will now feature in the champions league for the first time i thought that seems to have put the brakes on too many of their players departing but captain choi youngjun signed for jeonbuk in the winter transfer window a major loss is marco who was also top scorer in k league 2 in the year they were promoted who appears to have followed the money to china also off to china is key centreback park jisoo so basically the backbone of the team from defence to attack has left

ulsan hyundai

known as the horangi   the tigers  ulsan have had intermittent success in asia winning the champions league for the first and only time in 2012 in an unbeaten run

towards the end of the 2018 season ulsan were battling gyeongnam for the second spot which brings with it direct qualification to the champions league group stages rather than having a playoff they lost out but were widely expected to secure a direct qualification spot anyway when they faced daegu fc in the fa cup final ultimately they finished the season on a low losing 51 on aggregate to daegu in the final 

pohang steelers

one of the few clubs that predates the formation of the k league pohang are another of the historical korean powerhouses they hold the record for the most number of champions league title 3 but their last title came in 2009

finishing fourth in the league they were hoping that ulsan would beat daegu in the fa cup final to pass their champions league spot on down but it didnt happen

jeju united

one of the original members of the k league founded as the yukong elephants in the seoul area as part of the decentralisation program they moved to bucheon kind of and were renamed as bucheon sk the decision to move to jeju in 2006 was an abrupt one and understandably deeply unpopular with the fans teams uprooting and moving elsewhere is a bit of a catalyst for the creation of new teams in korea and the fans formed bucheon fc 1995 in the absence of bucheon sk

the reason given for the relocation was to the address the imbalance in football teams being located around seoulgyeonggido and jeju did not have a pro team at the time but there are suggestions the owners sk group wanted to cut their investment and recoup some costs

there were recent rumours that jeju would move yet again back north to yongin but who knows 

jeju had a pretty mediocre season what more can i say

suwon samsung bluewings

suwons 2018 season was a bit bonkers and especially so in their champions league run

in their champions league group in which they were drawn with eventual winners kashima antlers suwon did not manage a single home win however they had managed to get two away wins and going into the final match they still had their fate in their own hands if they could win against group leaders kashima in japan they won 10 getting three away wins and topping the group

manager seo jungwon at a time when suwon were 4th in the league resigned the day before the first leg of their champions league quarterfinal clash with jeonbuk due to fan protests jeonbuk were apparently completely bamboozled by this event and took a 30 beating at home then in the return leg in suwon jeonbuk fought back to win 30 but suwon were able to scrape through on penalties to face kashima antlers yet again in the semis

in the semifinal fixture suwon went 20 up against kashima antlers inside the first 10 minutes but went on to lose 32 in the first leg
soon after manager seo returned as suddenly as he had departed having been gone for just 6 weeks  
in the second leg suwon went a goal down in the first half but came back with 3 in the second half to be on their way to the final after 60 mins played however kashima antlers fought back to get two more goals and win 65 on aggregate and would go on to win the final if you want to relive a part of that rollercoaster night here you gohttpsyoutuberxy8pagy1aq and heres an idea of the atmosphere that nighthttpstwittercomtheafcclstatus1055055104607285248

at one point it looked like they might qualify for the champions league again for the 2019 season but suwon didnt win any of their final five league matches and dropped to 6th

manager seo left again at the end of the season and will manage japans sagan tosu recently captain kim eunsun was released from the club for drinkdriving the drama just never ends

daegu fc

prior to the world cup daegu were languishing at the bottom of the table but after the return they found some kind of consistent form helped out by world cup hero goalkeeper jo hyeonwoo they really peaked at the right time as daegu made it to the fa cup final and against the odds defeated ulsan hyundai 51 on aggregate meaning for the first time they will feature in the champions league this is no mean feat for team whose best ever finish in the top flight is 7th place if they carry over their momentum into the 2019 season the year could be one of their most successful ever they will also be playing in a new footballspecific stadium this year

gangwon fc

gangwon are a fairly midbottom team i dont really know what to say about them they did have the 2ndhighest top scorer in the 2018 season though bosnian uros deric they also had the worst colour scheme in the league last season their kit is slightly improved this season

incheon united

i always like to imagine that incheon chose their strip so that they could be the inter to fc seouls ac milan they even have a nickname nerazzurri another nickname is the durumi    the cranes

incheon spent most of the 2018 season at the very bottom of table and had the jointleakiest defence in the league they brought in norwegian manager jrn andersen midway through the season to turn their fortunes around but even after that they were on the wrong end or the biggest thrashing of the season 70 against gangwon coming into the end of the season though they were playing really nice attacking football even if they didnt always get the result at the split they were still bottom but won 4 out of 5 games to pull themselves up 3 places

it was in attack that incheon shone montenegrin stefan mugosa was their top scorer in his debut season moon seonmin with the best goal celebration in the league also put in a strong performance but has now signed for champions jeonbuk nam junjae returned in the summer to score some bangers costa rican international aguilar was also impressive but has signed for jeju in the new season

sangju sangmu

the military team where other k league players get loaned to to complete their military service their history goes far back in one sense as various military teams were playing way back to the 50s but they were founded for pro footballers to serve their time only in 1984 although they were for pro players they competed in the semipro national league until 2003 when they joined the k league based in gwangju when gwangju fc were formed they moved to sangju

sangju sangmu do not have any foreign players for obvious reasons and cannot compete in the champions league although the chances of ever finishing in a qualifying spot are fairly slim

fc seoul

fc seoul wow what happened having won the league in 2016 albeit somewhat fortuitously and always finishing in the top half if not competing for the title in the past decade nobody expected seoul to be fighting against relegation although relatively solid defensively they scored the least number of goals in the league season of all teams their star foreign players almost all left before the season started including dejan to rivals suwon and were not replaced with the same quality and for many matches seoul played with an allkorean team one bit of good news for the future is that former captain osmar will return from his loan to cezero osaka for the new season

seoul at least managed to avoid relegation by beating busan ipark over two legs in the playoff helped by a red card in the first leg surprisingly they managed to score 3 goals in the first leg in open play

seoul is probably the most popular club in korea im sure helped by the fact that it is the main club in a city of 10 million people  seoul generally has the highest game attendances although it was much reduced last season because they were so crap

starting out as luckygoldstar ie lg fc in chungcheong province the team was permitted to relocate to seoul at the start of the 90s and were renamed as lg cheetahs during the decentralisation period they moved to anyang modifying their name to anyang lg cheetahs after the world cup the team successfully negotiated a move back to seoul and did away with their cheetahs moniker taking their current name fc seoul their founding and rebirth years are both on their badge  1983 and 2004

seongnam fc

gaining direct promotion due to asan mugunghwas situation seongnam is actually the most decorated team in korea

founded in 1989 in seoul as ilhwa chunma they were forced out of seoul and settled in cheonnan for a period in 2000 they moved to seongnam a satellite city of seoul and appended the city name to the name of the club seongnams title drought started when the head of the owner company that backed seongnam died in 2012 and the board were keen to let go of the club seongnam city government took over ownership of the club for the 2014 season and they were renamed seongnam fc seongnam are now back in k league 1 after a 2 year absence

k league 2 clubs

by last seasons standings

jeonnam dragons

jeonbuks jeolla province rivals they finished the previous season on an awful losing streak and were relegated for the first time

asan mugunghwa

police fc they missed promotion despite winning k league 2 and will probably lose their police affiliation by next year

busan ipark

one of the founding members of the k league and another that effectively predates the k league busan were beaten by k league 1 opposition in the prorel playoff for the second year in a row they were the first korean team to win the asian continental title in the 80s

daejeon citizen

one of the first communitycityowned clubs in korea

gwangju fc

relegated in the 2017 season despite finishing 5th in 2018 they still got to participate in the playoffs due to asan mugunghwas situation

fc anyang

founded in 2013 finally filling the void left by the departure of fc seoul from the city

suwon fc

the other suwon team they featured in k league 1 briefly in 2016

bucheon fc 1995

formed after the departure of jeju united from the city formed in 2007 1995 refers to the year of the organising of the yukong elephant fan club including 1995 in the name is meant to show its a club for the fans or something

bucheon fc 1995 are also one half of the 032 derby with incheon united because they share the same area code 032

ansan greeners fc

formed only in 2017 theyve had two 9thposition finishes

seoul eland fc

the other seoul team their debut season was in 2015 they didnt do very well last season although it was very tight at the bottom of the table

winter transfer window activity

from a monetary point of view korea is the biggest net exporterhttpsenynacokrviewaen20190131006600315sectionsportsindex of players in asia in the transfer market this winter window was no different with what i would say were the two biggest stories involving young homegrown korean talent going abroad

the first is that of jeonbuk and national team star centreback kim minjae nicknamed the monster there were rumours of an offer from english side watford but it wasnt clear if there ever was any offer or negotiations  kim himself said he did not know of any interest from watford it doesnt really matter now  kim signed with chinese side beijing sinobo guoan and will see champions league football with them in the new season being drawn in the same group as jeonbuk

the second is hwang inbeom who has signed for mls side vancouver whitecaps hwang inbeom played in k league 2 last season with asan mugunghwa and daejeon citizen but has impressed as a midfield playmaker and is currently seen as a replacement for ki sungyueng in the national team

for a recognisable name for western readers the best i have is englishman jordon mutch who signed for gyeongnam from crystal palace resulting in this awkward photo ophttpspbstwimgcommediadzg3adzvyaakrkqformatjpgnamemedium another recognisable name is mix diskerud on loan to ulsan from man city but he joined the previous year

k league 1s top scorer marco left gyeongnam for hebei china fortune and his replacement is luc castaignos signed from sporting cp his stats in europe havent been great in recent years but he may fare better in korea

there were of course a few hundred domestic internal transfers and number of other foreign player signings  if you want the full list k league uniteds winter transfer trackerhttpwwwkleagueunitedcom2019012019kleaguewintertransfertrackerhtml has it all



history of club football in korea  establishment of the k league

association football was first introduced to korea in 1882 when british royal navy crew harboured at incheon played a game it wasnt until the 1900s that football began to take hold and the first public match was played in 1905 there was a boom in in the 1910s with a number of football clubs being formed and rivalries began to form between clubs in seoul and pyongyang

the first nationwide competition was the all joseon football tournament joseon being the name for korea at the time founded in 1921 there wasnt actually a champion crowned in 1921 as the tournament was cut short due to complaints over refereeing decisions all this was taking place during japanese occupation of korea during most of the first half of the 20th century

according to the kfahttpswebarchiveorgweb20170606162658httpkfaorkrrecordhistoryasp football was the only tonic that could relieve the the national resentment that had accumlated in the hearts as a colony under the japanese empire and was a sprout that could foster the hope of freedom a tad hyperbolic maybe

one side effect of being a japanese colony is that some korean teams were allowed to participate in the emperors cup japans fa cup and in 1935 kyungsung fc kyungsung was a name for seoul during japanese occupation won the tournament becoming the only nonjapanese team to ever do so

the all joseon football tournament ran until wwii

after wwii came korean independence and shortly thereafter the korean war there was football being played during this period continuously when possible the korean national semiprofessional football league was founded in 1964 and is the predecessor to todays tier 3 national league many of the teams during this period were works teams  employed by a company playing under the name of the company but also having a proper job in the company cha bumkun said by some to be the greatest ever asian footballer rose to fame during this period albeit mainly in the bundesliga starting his senior career at the mighty seoul trust bank fc the most astonishing statistic about cha bumkun is he only received one yellow card in his career

finally we get to the establishment of professional football with the korean super league in 1983 now named the k league initially there were only 5 teams and 2 of those teams dropped out within 2 years the number of clubs in the top flight has varied from the initial 5 to a high of 16 in 2011 in 2013 the k league split into two tiers now k league 1 and k league 2

for the first few years of the k league teams did not have a fixed home stadium that they played in because there was no standard homeaway format that we are so familiar with today instead it was operated as a national tour

the k league in the modern era has its own history but one of the most interesting events was the forced exodus of all three clubs from seoul in 1996 as part of a policy to spread the popularity of football around the country also with an eye on stadium infrastructure for the 2002 world cup two of the clubs didnt move far only just outside the city of seoul each to one of seouls satellite cities yukong elephants only halfleft because the city they moved to didnt have a stadium yet so they continued to play in seoul until a new stadium was built for a number of years the k league was without any seoul representation in 2004 after the need to find someone to fill a great big national football stadium and help pay towards it one of those relocated teams moved back to seoul becoming fc seoul



football pyramid  league format

the current system looks like this


 tier  league  notes 

 1  k league 1 12 teams 1 relegation to k league 2 1 relegation playoff with k league 2
 2  k league 2  10 teams 1 promotion to k league 1 1 promotion playoff with k league 2
 3  national league  8 teams semipro no promotionrelegation
 4  k3 league advanced  12 teams semiproamateur 2 relegations to k3 league basic 1 relegation playoff with k3 league basic 
 5  k3 league basic 11 teams semiproamateur 2 promotions to k3 league advanced 1 promotion playoff with k3 league advanced 
 6 division 5 league 6 regional leagues with 52 teams some relegation to division 6 
 7  division 6 league 26 regional leagues with 174 teams some prorel with divisions 5  7 
 8  division 7 league 160 regional leagues with 960 teams some promotion with division 6 

as you can see the naming is completely screwed up  k3 league occupies tiers 4 and 5 and division 5 is in tier 6 this is probably because the top tier k league only split in two in 2013 with the creation on k league 2 and nobodys been bothered to update their names

the national league sits stubbornly in tier 3 blocking any continuous prorel the powers that be have regularly stated that they want to reform the pyramid to have a continuous route from top to bottom at least to the bottom of k3 league within a few years but for some reason its not happening the winners of the 2006 national league season were offered promotion to the k league but they declined the offer the winners of the 2007 season were also offered promotion but declined again even though they said they would like promotion at the start of the season

one of the more recent additions to the k league bucheon fc 1995 joined from k3 league because they didnt want to pay the higher fees associated with starting out in the national league

outside of this system there is the wk league the womens top tier the wk league has been dominated by incheon red angels no connection to incheon united in recent years theres no womens champions league in asia yet but for a few years in the past the winners of the wk league played the winners of japans nadeshiko league for a little more info on the wk league see this reddit posthttpswwwredditcomrwomenssoccercommentsaqkew5southkoreasroutetotheworldcupthewkleague

also worth a mention is the separate u league for universities and colleges some of the teams from which enter into the korean fa cup the route into a pro team in korea is often direct from high school or university teams something i dont think exists in europe some high school teams are even seen as feeder teams for a particular pro team i wont pretend to understand how the system works but ill leave you with the tidbit that park jisung was first signed to a professional team from a university team almost by accident as the scout had come to see a different player but took home park instead

k league 1

k league 1 consists of 12 teams playing 38 games the format is identical to the scottish premiership  all teams play each other three times and then after the split the top 6 and bottom 6 battle it out among themselves to settle the championship and relegation spots respectively the first tie breaker for teams level on points is goals scored rather than goal difference

the top 3 places offer a chance in the afc champions league the fourth champions league spot going to the winner of the korean fa cup bottom place gets relegated to k league 2 whilst 11th place has a playoff with one of the teams that finished 2nd4th in k league 2

international context

in the current format of the afc champions league the competition is split into a west region think uae saudi arabia qatar iran and an east region the east region is dominated by three nations  korea china and japan australia who decided it wanted to be asian earlier this century has also had a bit of success

this year there will be two debutants from korea  gyeongnam fc and daegu fc its dufficult to predict how well these two will fare but if they can carry some form over to this year they could get out of the group stages at least

determining who has the strongest teams amongst the big three east asian nations is a difficult task and is hugely subjective im almost i say almost because obviously k league is best league of the opinion that theyre as close to equal as makes no difference korea has the most number of titles and the club with the most titles pohang steelers china have the highest coefficient japan has won the past two tournaments

in recent years china and japan have had a number of big star foreigner signings eg paulinho torres which are absent from the k league i believe this is due to japan having cash mainly coming from tv money and china having cash from well being china despite korea lagging financially all three nations have the same limit on foreign players three foreigners plus one from another afc country and so korean teams are still competitive due to the relative strength of their domestic players

while were on the topic of the champions league each of the big three east asian nations get 4 places total  2 or 3 to the group stages and 1 or 2 to the last qualifying playoff round before the group stages this playoff round is massively weighted in the big threes favour as they have to win just one home game when the weather is still genrally freezing cold against a team from a nation with a tropical climate i dont know of a korean club ever losing this playoff match

the afc cup is sometimes said to be the equivalent of uefas europa league but its not really comparable the afc cup is for the weaker asian nations only and korea arent allowed to enter



resources

websites  podcasts

for those of us who are linguistically challenged heres how you can follow k league in english

one of the best websites for news match previews and analysis is k league unitedhttpwwwkleagueunitedcom it covers everything  k league 1  2 fa cup transfer news national team and more it also has a podcast if youre into that sort of thing

a really good resource for uptodate breaking news is an english version of a korean news outlet the sports category of yonhap newshttpsenynacokrsportsindex for example is great although youll be getting other sports news in there such as korean baseball football appears pretty regularly also the team that works on writing the articles dont seem to work weekends

tavern of the taeguk warriorshttpwwwtaegukwarriorscom has a lot of information mainly on the korean national team and tracks the progress of koreans playing in europe but covers the domestic club scene now and then

48 shades of footballhttps48shadesblogcom is a great english language podcast following korean football

the asian gamehttpswwwtheasiangamenet is another great english language podcast that doesnt specifically follow korean football but since they cover asian football theyll sometimes have indepth coverage of the korean clubs competing in the afc champions league as well as the korean national team

for your twitter fix the korea football news korfootballnewshttpstwittercomkorfootballnews and viva la kleague kleagueno1httpstwittercomkleagueno1 twitter feeds are pretty quick with breaking news in english 

there is also the official k league websitehttpwwwkleaguecom which can be viewed in english but i think unless you live in korea its going to be painfully slow to use

then of course theres rkleague with news and discussion and where you can ask questions to the community

highlights  watching live

all highlights from k league 1 matches are uploaded fairly promptly to the spotv youtube channelhttpswwwyoutubecomuserspotv spotv is a korean sports broadcaster they also upload content from the kbo baseball and the v league volleyball so youll have to scroll down until you see something saying k1 it helps if you know how korean letters sound phonetically to understand which teams are playing but you can also see which match a video is from the crests in the thumbnail the commentary will be in korean but each video is really good quality typically about 10 minutes long

if you watch to watch live the good news is that is very easy and basically free i have no idea whether any national broadcasters or streaming services around the world have k league rights but in korea itself essentia"
jeolla,south koreas capital scraps testing mandate on foreigners,"this is the best tldr i could make originalhttpsabcnewsgocomhealthwirestorysouthkoreascapitalscrapstestingmandateforeigners76553271cidsocialtwitterabcn reduced by 57 im a bot

 the city will still recommend tests for foreigners employed at workplaces that are at risk of spreading infections such as bars and small factories said lee haeseon an official from the seoul metropolitan government

 the city of incheon and the provinces of gangwon south jeolla and north gyeongsang  areas that rely on lowwage migrant labor to sustain factories and farms  didn039t announce changes to their mandated tests on foreign workers

 quotthe point is that we are now recommending tests and no longer mandating themquot said lee the seoul official assuring that no foreigner worker will be fined for failing to get tested

 lone lines had snaked around designated testing stations in seoul after the city on wednesday began necessitating tests for all foreign nationals employed in the city regardless of their visa status or recent travel history

 seoul had around 240000 registered foreigners at the end of 2020 but city officials had no estimate of how many were under the test mandate

 on thursday british ambassador simon smith said his embassy told south korea039s national government the tests quotare not fair they039re not proportionate nor are they likely to be effectivequot he still advised british nationals in the area to be tested to avoid fines

jeolla,travelling around korea for 34 weeks in aprilmay any suggestions,"im travelling with a friend for 12 weeks initially well be around the seoul area northern region in general the only thing on our itinerary right now is going on the hangang cycling route and hanging around seoul talking to locals and other travellers that sort of thing 

after that i will be off on my own and i intend to go around as many less touristy areas as possible i would say i like nature so any place with national parks or mountainous areas are good the general areas im looking at are gyeonggi gangwon north chungcheong south gyeongsang south jeolla i would like to go to the larger cities too so on my list right now theres seoul daejeon daegu gyeongju gwangju and busan plus the jirisan and seoraksan national parks i might want to go hiking at some point too and am looking at either the national parks andor the mountainseaside region near busan 

which would be the best way to travel around  bus rail or both also what are couchsurfing prospects like in places outside of seoul any suggestions for itinerary id prefer places that are off the usual beaten path for tourists someone has suggested daejeon for instance and places with natural scenery im not that interested in the cultural aspect but if theres a place thats very much worth visiting id love to find out more thanks"

 yongmunchuncheon 370 kmh connects to the jungang line

jeolla,eventthe napryazheniye initiative,"from the ministry of internal affairs 

 the napryazheniye initiative will see the expansion of several frontiers of the russian economt over the next two years notably it will finalize the natural gas and oil exportation to east asia and put it into full productivity nations of interest will be the peoples republic of china the current state of the dprk and the republic of korea by fully fleshing out russian trade with east asia the russian federation will be able to put a decline to its economic partnerships with the european union additional plans will entail advancing the arctic trade routes for ships traveling through with adding outposts to the region for emergency situations and navigation for ships traveling through 

 the beginning of the plan will see the construction of a set of pipelines in west mongolia to entail exportation to west china this set of pipelines will entail a total of three pipelines running through the region connected to natural gas and petroleum sites within siberia most notably the yamalonenets autonomus okrug where the majority of the russian federations natural gas lies these pipelines will have periodic compressor stations every 40100 miles and will travel through mongolia to the chinese city of urumqi and the provinces of gansu and ningxia this initiative will cost 3 billion dollars to complete and be one of the largest projects yet at 140 million cubic meters per year being exported on this set of pipelines mainly gansu and ningxia will be areas of export this will take one to two years

 the next part of the initiative will be constructing a pipeline extending from vladivostok to gangwon south korea this pipeline will then meet a large junction and compressor station within south korea where the pipeline will split to two pipelines servicing seoul and south jeolla the compressor and junction station will employ an estimated 1600 people the pipeline will be able to export a total of forty million cubic meters per year this project will cost another 5 billion dollars and take an estimated one to two years 

 the next project will entail the construction of outposts in the russian eez within the arctic to protect merchant ships traveling through the now opened route several outposts manned by the ministry of interior will provide emergency services of any ships using the route in addition the ministry of interior will construct an array of communication towers to provide a degree of geographic guidance to ships traveling through the area this will cost an estimated 3 billion dollars and take three years to complete due to the harshness of the north 

 we recommend that japan south korea and china all look to using the arctic route for trade as it is significantly shorter than the current suez route to europe thank you for your time"

 much of the internal space is taken up by the many large engines which also give it its weight these will give it the power to push away any vessel it is likely to encounter and tow damaged or arrested ships back to port



foreign procurement

the military must adapt to its new roles counter insurgency is now an extremely important part of our armed forces operations we estimate that around 370000 troops will need to be based in north korea for a few years to stop any rebels from gaining control several purchases of coin equipment and investment into training is needed

the high endurance zephyrhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiqinetiqzephyr can give us an eye in the sky over any potential hotspots of unrest such as loyalist cities and the mountains where the rebels hide they can fly out of range of the rebels antiair systems and have an extremely high endurance letting us watch insurgent activity for a long time without fear of losing aircraft we require 8 zephyr 8 uavs for the rok air force

to control rioters or potential rebels we wish to acquire 50 units of the ads iihttpsenwikipediaorgwikiactivedenialsystemactivedenialsystemii directed energy weapon 5 million apiece to be mounted to modified versions of the hyundai k711 truck these nonlethal devices will allow us to peacefully disperse crowds and stop an escalation of violence

to clearly send loud messages of warning or order rioters to stop we would like to buy 200 units of the lrad1000xihttpwwwlradxcomlradproductslrad1000xi 30000 apiece to be mounted to the hyundai k131 and surion helicopters 



new special forces unit

our special operation forces have been busy in the north hunting dprk officials and rebels this is a task which requires special skills and warrants the creation of a new special forces brigade the 2000 strong 15th special forces brigade bloodhound will be an autonomous unit of the army special warfare command with additional training in extremely closequarters battle and rapid deployment raids and less focus on wartime skills such as parachuting missions involving fighting in tunnels and capturing former dprk generals many of whom are still at large highlighted the need for this brigades formation they will also be responsible for locating the missing warheads and nuclear material a large training centre will be built in north jeolla a fake town 2 km across complete with tunnels that will also be used to train army peacekeepers before they go north"
jeolla,layman buseol,"besides the famous laymen of india vimalakirti and china pangyun there is a famous korean layman called buseol aka buseol geosa lit layman buseol here is a story about him from wake up and laugh p4546



long ago there was a woman who was unable to speak the year she turned nineteen she met the monk buseol and upon meeting him was suddenly able to speak for the first time in her life as he began to leave she clung to him crying i can speak because of you if you were to leave there would be no life for me if you wont marry me ill kill myself as soon as you go buseol thought to himself what kind of disciple of the buddha would i be if i were to go and leave her to die id disgrace the buddha and violate the spirit of his teachings above all i should save her life how could i hope to move forward and eventually achieve enlightenment if i dont face the problems that are now right in front of me with this view he gave up the monastic life and married her such a compassionate heart

one day two buddhist monks who used to practice with buseol called on him because he had married they treated him with contempt and spoke roughly to him however he remained calm and received them warmly he treated them well and never argued over the things they were saying such deep compassion and wisdom such profound meaning in his actions

nevertheless buseol felt that he couldnt let them leave without doing something about their mistaken views so he filled three gourds with water and hung them in a row next he told the monks to each break a gourd when each monk hit his gourd the gourd broke and the water fell to the ground however when buseol hit his gourd the gourd shattered and the pieces fell to the ground but the water just dangled there it was suspended in the shape of the gourd as if it were rozen when the two monks saw this they realized that they had been mistaken about hte level of buseols spiritual practice after some reflection they apologized saying until now weve paid attention to only theories without having tried to put htem into practice further we didnt discard the stubbornness and arrogance that arose from the idea of our having studied under so many great seon masters please forgive us then they bowed deeply to buseol who looked like just another poor woodcutter buseol then told them that the physical body is like the gourds they broke whereas their inherent nature is like the water dangling in the air he taught them that our inherent nature remains just as it is and is never caught by anything with this the two monks became his disciples



further info from the glossary of the same book

buseol he was born in the silla kingdom of korea probably around the year 610 ce he was ordained at bulguk temple and spent more than a decade living on duryun mountain with his dharma brothers yeonghi and yeongjo after many years of practice the three of them left for the odae mountains sometime during the reign of queen seondeok 632647 ce while traveling they spent a night at the house of a layman in what is now the district of mangyeong in north jeolla province it was there that the incident with the laymans daughter myohwa took place buseol married myohwa and they had two children a son and a daughter although married buseol continued to practice diligently and achieved enlightenment before either of his dharma brothers

jeolla,humourous translated comment found in a koreabang article about a murder in mokpo,"travel guide to the peoples republic of jeolla

1 you have to use the standard language of jeolla province if by chance you happen to be found out to use words or accent of gyeongsang you might be assaulted by so called democratization

2 if by any chance you are coming by vehicle with gyeongsang province licence plate you must protect your car by bulletproof material before entering the peoples republic of jeolla province

3 if you decide to pretend to be a foreigner because you dont have a sufficient command of the language of the peoples republic of jeolla province you may have to pay an exorbitant price for room rent therefore you have to be careful at all times

4 citizens of the republic of korea who chose to enter into the peoples republic of jeolla area must at all times keep uttering loudly long live the great teacher kim daejung kim was from jeolla province if you happen to leave out the honorary title of great teacher you might get a plate of jjajangmyeon noodles korean chinesestyle noodles landing in your face so we advise caution

5 even for short distances you must ride a bulletproof car in no case should you take a boat anywhere if you are unlucky you might be thrown out into the sea at heuksando island if your luck is good you might be forced to live as a slave for over 20 years and you might succeed in escaping at the end but we still strongly recommend that you do not take a boat in the peoples republic of jeolla

6 as the first thing after entering the peoples republic of jeolla you must visit the kim daejung convention centre if while visiting the kim daejung convention centre you happen to skip the honorary title of the great teacher and thoughtlessly call him just by name or if you frown or express dissatisfaction in that very instant you may fall a victim to the dagger it is imperative that visitors pay particular care while visiting the centre

b however as i am muslim im obviously concerned about my religious practice  if there is halal food available a mosque that is not too far whether there is a muslim community or not and because i know korea is not the most muslim friendly in terms of access to certain things i know it will be even harder to find outside of seoul where most of the muslim community is at   
as i heard korean transports are pretty easy and fast so i could eventually go to seoul or busan big cities to fetch some halal meat when the iron gets low haha but this point probably needs more consideration well see

other than thatim pretty much okay with any university that has  decent dorms and easy transport available i would like to travel domestically a lot so i dont mind if the city is boring

sogang was my most recommended university that i received from korean people but i dont know if its still the case i put gyeongsang up there in the podium because i like how far from seoul it is and how close it is to busan also i want to learn some  while im there so it makes sense the 2 other universities ive checked out but i cant be too sure so im looking at gyeongsang uni and sogang in priority

i want to be close enough to walk around but also take trains and metro for my daytrips as i stayed in insadong before id like to be somewhere else i thought about hongdae is it a good choice my plan is to make it as a home base but crying as it will be expensive  i also thought about staying in a far away area just to recharge and sleep cheaply  also staying in multiple places just to enjoy different districts of seoul but it would be tiring to be always moving around

places im thinking of visiting in the 17 days i have left

 petit france  gapyeong shuttle bus  nami island thinking a guided tour could be worth it
 suwon fortress
 suncheon 2 days  hesitating about a day trip to mokpo
 gwangju maybe not worth it
 jeonju  namwon can i visit both in a day tho is it worth doing a day trip or tour to jejonju or should it be an overnight stay

gyeongsang,pi technological edge,"it has been so long since my last one shot inspired by the following writing prompt from rwritingprompts

look i know your species wants to wipe out all others who are weaker than you but basing that off physical strength and not technological is a great way to go extinct said the human

well enjoy

it was called survival of the fittest

at least thats what humanity called it there are many species each with a unique term to describe the same thing however unlike many intelligent beings capable of space travel to the inkroins it wasnt just a term to describe a process of natural selection but instead it was foreign policy

there have been many attempts by nations to resist the attacks by the inkroin empire but for all their efforts their sacrifices made and their lives lost there had never been a single successful defense against the inkroins as time passed and as oncegreat nations collapsed one by one leaders of countries accepted that their fates were sealed as soon as they received the declaration of war

no one knew how or why the inkroins first began their conquest to purge the galaxy of every other being those who knew the reason had long since been executed by the emperors infamous death squad known for purging every last member of a species by any means possible

humanity grew up and entered the galactic stage at this time as neil armstrong delivered his famous speech on the surface of the moon inkroin infantry literally tore apart the appendages of defending gal forces on a planet 45 lightyears away as the perseverance rover and his drone friend landed on the red planets dusty surface the inkroin imperial battlefleet bombarded the last remaining planet still controlled by the zumit republic

when president zachary currier delivered a speech on the newly constructed maimi interplantry spaceport as the worlds first ftl capable ship launched into orbit no one in the galaxy took note of the fledgling species as empires turned into ashes that was a mistake that would cause the inkroins to beg for mercy at the feet of humanity

there was no astronomer on earth who didnt note the craters the ashes and the smokes left behind as a result of the careless destruction of inkroins on their crusade to purge the galaxy of any lifeform that wasnt theirs not when humanity was sending uncrewed ships to chart the galaxy when they did humanity saw what may be to come

nations across the eath sent unmanned probes across the galaxy to find and retrieve any objects of note the wreckage of battles centuries ago the weapons left on planets that were bombed to oblivion materials of wrecked structures and everything else scattered in other star systems around the sol system humanitys brightest worked on reverse engineering as much as possible as soon as possible one could perhaps call it the greatest research initiative in history mere decades later humanity marveled at what they had created

that was when they noticed

it was a short and direct message beamed by radio waves and delivered 30 years after the inkroins sent the message war was coming but only one side was prepared for whats to come

at a cia space station orbiting europa men and women were listening very closely to all activity within 20 lightyears or an average of 35 jumps between the furthest range at which the base could pick up a signal and earth it turns out ftl jumps leave a vast and noticeable mark on their surroundings especially when you know what you are looking for

a dot was shown on the monitor a ship had jumped in range of the bases detectors and from now on its every step is being monitored soon the what was one a single dot turned into two then five then an entire fleet of 100 ships could be seen approaching earth an operator recorded this new movement and passed it on to a very special building in langley 6283 million kilometers away

the message from europa was broadcasted loud and clear to every military around the world they had five months to prepare and not a second would be wasted in japan the japan space self defence forces brand new hakuun class cruisers lifted off from a mountain base in an undisclosed location joined by south korean gyeongsang class frigates and headed off to the edge of the solar system us space force carriers destroyers and a dozen auxiliary and support ships changed course from their regular patrols the british battleship hms sol powered up her gauss cannons and turned away from the royal space force spaceports humanity will make sure that this was a battle the enemy would never forget

imperial grand admiral omhor stood at the bridge of the first fleets dreadnought its interiors are now centuriesold yet its exterior stayed sparkling clean if one were to inspect it from a distance they might mistake the ship for a brand new one that had just started her maiden voyage never in all the years has she ever sustained any battle damage yet an impending feeling of doom plagued the back of omhors mind maybe he should sleep more often instead of partying with the crew every night

the jump towards  if he recalled correctly  the system of sol went out without a hitch corvettes at the front powered up their blink engines and were quickly followed by the rest of the fleet a human request for the fleets surrender was broadcasted by radio wave and was ridiculed before being dismissed by omhor then it happened all at once

hulkuns was on board one of the corvettes of the first fleet like many other soldiers he had done pretty well for themselves by way of looting civilians once they landed on the planets and this single planet civilization inhabited by bipedal mammals with almost no physical bodily strength compared to themselves would have been easy money for everyone involved at least thats how it should have been he had not noticed his hull heating up by an entire fleet of ships thousands of kilometers away blasting focused gamma rays at every corvette that could be seen when he did notice however a small hole had already penetrated the cabin hulkuns scrambled to send a message to command but it had already been too late seconds later the cabin was met with depressurized silence

the communication crew was panicking  58 of the total 60 corvettes had suddenly lost contact with the dreadnought the ships didnt fall off the communication system it was just that no one responded to any message but before anyone could have figured it out hundred of gauss cannons railguns missile launchers autocannons and artillery fired their payload towards the first fleet instantly detonating almost every ship that was left omhor desperately shouted for every ship to attack the enemy but it was far too late before he realized that there were no more ships to respond to his commands to save himself the admiral ordered for his dreadnought to turn back and fire up the blink engine but the aging subftl thrusters were nowhere near the capabilities of what humanity has to offer a single missile hit its mark on the dreadnaughts nuclear engines the explosion lit up the emptiness of space

the inkroins had never lost before the admiral of the german space force wondered how their emperor must be feeling right now but now isnt time to speculate a war has still yet to be won"
gyeongsang,2024 south korean national assembly election would the left secure twothird supermajority ," south korean national assembly election is about 2 weeks away and there is a sudden surge of support for the left in the polls and local media are talking about a twothirds supermajority of the leftwing bloc as support for the ruling rightwing people power party ppp crumbles in this post i want to talk about why this happened and try to explain the current political climate in south korea


1 left in disarray lee jaemyungs dumpster fire


 until march the south korean left was in crisis as infighting over lee jaemyung the controversial leader of the democratic party dpk intensified his purge of dissidents within the party and his corruption caused the fragmentation of the dpk leading to the party splitting into several smaller entities meanwhile the ruling conservative people power party ppp was gaining support as they focused on expanding the healthcare workforce however everything changed when president yoon sokyoel launched a brazen attack on the rule of law and press freedom to cover up an accident within the military


2 mystery of a drowned marine corporal defense minister on the run  journalists threatened with knife attack


 this story dates back to july 19th 2023 when a great flood hit north gyeongsang province prompting the deployment of marines for search and rescue operations during the operation a marine corporal drowned due to the lack of proper equipment such as a life jacket provided by the command subsequent military police investigations revealed negligence among the commanding officers leading to a report submitted to the ministry of defense for civilian scrutiny

 however defense minister lee jongsup acted unlawfully to protect the commanding officers the military police who filed the report were fired and the minister covered up the incident sparking a major scandal that ultimately led to his resignation following his resignation he came under investigation by the corruption investigation office cio while the scandal initially faded from public consciousness as the investigation progressed it resurfaced when lee jongsup was appointed as the ambassador to australia and had his cio travel ban lifted by the ministry of justice moj this clear indication of a presidentiallevel coverup reignited public interest prompting journalists to investigate further

 during their inquiries hwang shangmu a civil society secretary to the president met with journalists to discuss the matter over a meal during the meeting hwang who claimed to be a former military intelligence member recounted a chilling incident from 1988 involving a journalist who had inquired about the military and was stabbed with a knife by military intelligence personnel this was clearly a veiled threat on journalists this revelation alarmed the journalists present especially amidst a spate of recent knife attacks on political figures making it headline news


3 angry voters conservatives in crisis


 this proved disastrous for the rightwing government as they were actively aiding a corrupt crony in evading justice while threatening journalists with knife attacks during the campaign season this exacerbated existing popular discontent with the governments austerity measures and antilabor policies the targeted journalists became openly hostile toward the government and the media began discussing how the arrogant and dogmatic government should be punished

 the ruling party began distancing itself from the government and demanded the resignation of the ambassador and the secretary eventually these two problematic officials resigned but the incident left a bitter taste for the electorate

 recent polls indicate a collapse in support for the ruling ppp and a rise in support for opposition parties some polls even suggest that the leftwing bloc might secure a twothirds supermajority the threshold needed for overriding a presidential veto and implementing constitutional reform according to polling conducted by the prominent business newspaper hankuk gyungjae the ppp is expected to secure only 9596 seats out of 300 with the rest dominated by the leftwing bloc composed of the justice party dpk and its splinter groups


4 cho kuk demagogue galvanizing the left 


 in the midst of this chaos an unlikely figure from the past has emerged to galvanize the left cho kuk a former justice minister who resigned in 2019 amidst a corruption scandal involving his daughters university admission has resurfaced he was compelled to step down after then prosecutor general yoon yokyoel initiated an investigation into his corruption upon his resignation cho alleged a vast conspiracy among prosecutors to subvert the democratic government in korea however as he was found guilty of his crimes in court he gradually faded from public memory

 this month however he has made a sudden return to the political scene he established a new party called the national innovation party nip and declared war on yoon his message of animosity towards yoon and prosecutors is resonating with voters his fiery rhetoric about rendering yoon a dead duck through constitutional reform or impeachment is gaining popularity the nip is surging in the polls and his strategy of abstaining from fielding candidates in firstpastthepost fptp seats and focusing on proportional representation pr seats is expected to increase the number of seats for the leftwing bloc


5 conclusion yoon sokyoel is pushing the south korean public toward the left 


 yoon sokyoel has never been a popular president his presidential campaign which utilized antifeminism backfired spectacularly as his margin of victory fell under 1 many pollsters expected a 5 or higher win for the conservative candidate this campaign method incited hatred toward conservatives among young female voters solidifying support for the left the supposed support of young males which was not concrete to begin with collapsed when his government attempted to undermine working conditions the military coverup of the marines death further eroded support among young males many of whom are subject to conscription and deeply concerned about conditions in the military as a result young men are caring less and less about feminism and expressing concerns over the governments assault on their living standards older individuals with nationalistic tendencies are expressing anger over his attempts to improve relations with japan yoons arrogant behavior and forceful policy implementation have disgusted swing voters

 the election is filled with uncertainty and it is unclear whether the current political climate will persist until election day the polls that predict twothird supermajority for the left are conducted by large rightwing media outlets like chosenilbo or prominent business newspapers which dont align with polls conducted by other outlets which indicate a victory for the left similar to 2020 but not supermajority but one thing is clear if the leftwing bloc secures an electoral victory despite its leadership being infested with incompetent crooks like lee and cho yoon has no one to blame but himself his arrogance and antilabor policies have driven voters toward the left even when the leftwing parties are in complete disarray at the moment in south korean politics there are always consequences for bad behavior

the general election will be held on april 10th and early voting is to be carried out on april 5th  6th 

"
gyeongsang,why havent korean opted for a federaldecentralized government in its thousands year history,"i just feel like it would make more sense if koreans just opted for a more decentralized yet ethnically homogenous state because of how stubborn many koreans are in their nature they just cant seem to agree on anything a lot of the time 

ive travelled to korea for many years and despite their uniform language and food there seems to be pretty vast differences in terms of what each provinceregion needs for its own economic and cultural development korea has had a very long history of basically hating each others guts dating way back to the jin and gojoseon era and proto three kingdoms era heck id even argue that cultural remnants of these different kingdoms still remain in different parts of south koreachungcheong gyeongsang jeolla urban core of seoulgyeonggi etc and dont even get me started on cultural and economic differences between the north and south

in fact i think the process of decentralizing the korean provinces may be even more important if korea were to reunify in the distant future even if korea were to reunify gradually and safely theres no doubt the northern and south provinces will still have massive cultural differences and mindsets so why not give each province more control and autonomy perhaps a federal republic of  koreainstead of the republic of korea would be more conducive for a stable polity"
gyeongsang,those that have worked in south gyeongsangnamdo aside from changwonbusan how was it,"specifically im wondering about geoje urban tongyeong urban goseong rural and namhae rural

ive been looking into applying for the gyeongsang moe goe for a public school position those who have taught in either a public school or hagwon could you share some of your experiences

ive read that applying through the goe chances are pretty good youll get placed at one of your preferences the application asks for 2 preferred urban areas and two preferred rural areas i feel like these choices might give me the best shot at being around the general area id like to be without competing for a bigger city like changwon or jinju 

were there traditional weightlifting gyms how was the commutehow many schools
were there a decent amount of people of similar age 2535
how was traveling tofrom seoul or busan on weekends 
anything else you think is worth mentioning

theres not much information about any of these places in general and im just trying to see what others have experienced and if they enjoyed their time any info would be greatly appreciated thanks"

1 dont fantasize about a person you havent met based on his online profile never waste your brain energy thats a novice behavior
2 when the target is detected assess what kind of person he is thoroughly in gay bars and clubs almost everyone is playing a cool guy but you can never know about their real personality
3 float like a butterfly and sting like a bee being shy will only annoy him its not a shame to get rejected its a shame to waste time because you dont have the courage to make the first impression that you are a trustworthy guy just openly hit on depressive and timid attitude will only him
4 if you meet someone you like in itaewon a district in seoul with a lot of gay clubs or speed dating dont try to hook up with him on the spot all you have to do is show your interest and get his phone number it is ten times more effective to meet later and suggest a date oneonone
5 always look into his eyes when seducing
6 you must not pretend to be excessively manly it is impossible to pretend for a long time in order to have a proper relationship you must be yourself from the beginning
7 timing is everything it is important to appear to him with a cool aura both physically and socially when hes looking for love
8 he who is ashamed of being gay is also ashamed of his gay lover that is you
9 if the guy you like has a crush on a straight oppa wait until the fantasy is shattered the straight oppa idealized in his head is invincible  its never something you can defeat its easier to seduce a guy with a lover
10 if theres a guy who has a good relationship and breaks up amicably be sure to remember him because hes a nice guy youd also like to date someday someone whos been in a relationship is likely to be better at it and bliss or curse gays usually dont date for more than six months keep an eye on men who are in a good relationship honestly there really isnt anything as easy to seduce as gay men with a lover but unless you prefer a uniquely dramatic life dont do that
11 if he cant kiss think again those who are not good at kiss are usually not good at sex either
12 if you have sex on the first date unless he is a player the conversation is likely to be cut off there are still very few koreans who can lead a cool conversation after a hookup
13 a gay man with less than 3 years of experience of gay lifestyle is less likely to be a good lover
14 a gay man with several gay friends who have been with him for more than 34 years is a proven guy with no major problems in his personality
15 gay men who partially came out tend to have a more stable relationship a guy who introduces you to a straight friend he came out with is a reliable guy humans are social animals  so if youre not part of his social life the relationship can be irresponsible and catastrophic
16 habitual lying is an almost incurable disease if you know a gay guy who habitually tells lies distance yourself from him
17 gay men who abhor flamboyance are likely those who repress their girlishness they will be reborn as a true ajumma 23 years later be careful its an important experiment to be lightly fruity with a new guy you met
18 those who use trauma as their source of energy are the worst lovers so be careful
19 if he behaves shitty after the first sex theres no chance he will be a good lover
20 if he says hes top but hes actually bottom or if he says hes versatile but hes just top or bottom hes not a person whos candid about his own desires so youll have communication issues if you are not good at psychoanalysis dont plan on seeing each other for a long time
21 the lover who keeps you from seeing gay friends is the one who cheats on you first
22 a man who is ashamed of cultivating his beauty does not live a stable life as a gay man
23 a person who gets along well with exboyfriends is almost 100 likely to be a man with special irresistible strengths
24 a man who knows how to enjoy life as a gay is more likely to become a good lover
25 let the gays who live on the edge just live on the edge
26 if an artist gay man has no chance of becoming a great artist he is only a shortterm lover
27 pc feminist gays are just as bad as macho gays
28 a lover who plays a game doesnt stay with a man for long
29 gays who chose the best life plan they could choose as gays are also good at relationships for someone who doesnt consider the fact that hes gay as a major factor in his life plan theres no way love is part of his life plan lets not forget that this also means that there is no room for you in his life
30 your true self is revealed when the two of you travel together to see if its a longterm or shortterm relationship travel is the best testing ground
31 whether its a longterm or shortterm relationship you should live in the moment dont be afraid to break up
32 before searching for a good guy lets check if im a good gay guy ready for a relationship
33 once ready you will attract men
34 but the choice is not easy
35 if youre not goodlooking try to be goodlooking
36 men who say looks dont matter are more concerned with looks
37 never play the drama queen
38 when physical connections go away intimacy also goes away call him every day and have sex at least once a week so that the relationship doesnt break down
39 after a greatamicable breakup some of your exboyfriends will suggest to get back together anytime later
40 recycling can be a good option
41 your boyfriend always cheats on you with someone you know
42 if you dump your boyfriend for cheating once youll have no chance to be in a longterm lifelong relationship
43 open polyamory is impossible in korea
44 confidence that seems wellfounded is more powerful than appearance
45 a man who is good at raising a dog is also good to his lover
46 living alone is better for dating
47 a newbie gay man who walks into your room alone always wants to have sex with the owner of the room your room is more powerful than a hotel room
48 you should not bring your one night partner into your house hook up outside your house
49 no matter whether he is rich or chaeboel if he does nothing for you with the money he is useless
50 give him a gift that he can carry with him
51 when handing a gift to carry hand it in a place where you will be remembered well that way the object and i are associated and the object evokes me
52 if you want a longterm relationship be sure to talk frankly about sex with your date during the honeymoon period
53 gays who do relationships with maternal instinct he tried to say codependence and gays with melancholy are hapless
54 think carefully about whether i want a boyfriend or a father right now
55 a wellwritten love letter is very very very powerful
56 your grandmas saying you cant do a man who rolls his eyes is 100 true
57 few gay people dont like a man in a suit presenting yourself in a suit is effective in attracting your partner
58 dont be fooled by suits
59 nine out of ten white guys in korea are dumbfucks unless you prefer a trash guy you have to be careful with your choice
60 lets not forget that korean american gay men consider themselves to be americans deep down whatever they are they act like yankees korean slang for white americans at the critical moment of breakup
61 jews are often mamaboys
62 actually koreans are like that too especially those from gyeongsang province
63 if you already said i love you to each other its okay to say i love you all the time
64 images unlike letters and words are never forgotten you shouldnt show shockingly ugly looks to your lover no matter how old your relationship is
65 if you make eye contact during sex your partner will never forget that moment
66 dont talk while having sex saying i love you often makes him feel embarrassed just a quiet lowpitched moan is the best the worst line is something like this hows it feel hyung you like it huh like it when giving oral sex dont keep your eyes open and look up at his facial expression
67 dont have the are we boyfriends talk when drunk
68 there is no need to say no on the spot when you are asked its not too late to date with him a few more times and refuse
69 if you make a habit of showering with your partner it is difficult for him to cheat on you
70 when you give your partner a chance to contribute to your life he rejoices it on a different dimension
71 there is no man without flaws
72 good education and beauty are sometimes manifested in one person however intelligence and beauty are not manifested together if theyre manifested together hes a catch go get him
73 the way he drives reveals his character when fighting
74 a true gay man yields the remote control to his partner
75 a gay man who doesnt try to get better is a living evil
76 a happy attitude leads to happiness
77 the melancholy of some gay men seems to be hereditary waiting for them to change is like waiting for a horn to grow on a rabbits head
78 a good friendship with a fag hag is no less than 10 lovers
79 dont imagine the origins of your partners aegyo acting cute
80 gay men with bad drinking habits cannot be a good longterm partner
81 learning sports massage is very useful
82 use only a minimal amount of perfume
83 as for the relationship issue if you dont have a super veteran gay friend its better to discuss it with your heterosexual girl friend
84 remember that the girl button and macho button are almost identical when pressed its always turned on
85 if you often press the button for fun there will be a repercussion
86 if youre trying to hang out in a gay nightclub and suddenly your eyes are burning your head is numb and the tables are dirty and unbearable its time to find a husband
87 it is important to know your partners pet peeves things they naturally dislike early on
88 you should familiarize yourself with your own pet peeves
89 usually a good lover already knows
90 based on what folks say if you like to be attached while sleeping you are a woman and if you do not like it you are a man whatever the truth is to be a good man you have to put up with numbness in your arms you dont die from a numb arm
91 manage your partner and work completely separately
92 a person who asks his partner to compare the importance of work to himself is an angel in good times but turns into a terrifying bitch when things are bad you have to be alert
93 it is beneficial to me to tell only good stories about my expartner even if its false
94 when you run away be sure you do
95 a sinking relationship is usually not saved even when you try to rescue it try consistently for a month and if that doesnt work move on
96 the saying if you are ugly at least you have to be good is a lie
97 unlike depression timidity is not cured by dating
98 if your hand is reaching out the moment you see a pretty man you already have a middleaged mans brain
99 never get involved in other peoples relationships at any time i can be gossiped too
100 its better to be gossiped with a lover than to get a good reputation as a single person without a lover
101 we must not forget that the desires of all men are in fact the same
102 often some gay men have bad traits of both male and female
103 when you look at how he spends his week and what he does you see what kind of person he is
104 a guy who has no place to destress throughout a week takes it out on his partner
105 in order to become a guy who does not whine at his boyfriend he must have a stable way to relieve stress apart from dating
106 in spite of all obstacles and difficulties when the opportunity arises be sure to check it out you have to go catch it
107 remember the world is vast and there are many gay men
108 despite the untested belief of mankind that whats important is invisible to the eye we judge everything by whats visible

x200b

a person who can reflect on how he has lived and what he has shown as a gay man is probably already a happy dr relationship

gyeongsang,advice on airport travel,im moving back home in august and im concerned about getting to the airport does anyone have any suggestions about getting to the airport with three suitcases i live in the gyeongsang region and currently there are no airport buses going to incheon from there i dont mind taking the train or anything but im just concerned about how im going to be able to handle my luggage and everything by myself
gyeongsang,question so what happens if a travel ban was imposed mid flight,im just curious today the philippines china hk and macau has imposed a travel ban for  north gyeongsang province or gyeongbuk including daegu and cheongdo county im pretty sure there arent any direct flights from those places to the philippines and they would have to fly through either maybe incheon or gimhae but what happen to the flights that already took off today were they made to go back to south korea on the same day
gyeongsang,ive already checked online and couldnt find anything but  are there intercity bus passes in s korea the equivalent of the korail pass,edit we plan to do a lot of travelling in the south but the rail connections between jeolla and gyeongsang seem sparse so bus it is

gyeongsang,reached people group of the week  koreans of south korea,"its that time of year again when we are forced to sit at a table and tell our families things we are thankful for but what i am thankful for is groups that became reached after thousands of years of being unreached today we are doing a rather obvious one the koreans im posting this one because south korea sends the second highest number of missionaries around the world how awesome is that and up until around 1800 they never had access to the gospel

how were they reached

catholicism was first introduced during the late joseon dynasty period by confucian scholars who encountered it in china in 1603 yi gwangjeong korean diplomat returned from beijing carrying several theological books written by matteo ricci an italian jesuit missionary to china he began disseminating the information in the books and the first seeds of christianity were sown in 1758 king yeongjo of joseon officially outlawed catholicism as an evil practice catholicism was reintroduced in 1785 by yi seunghun and since then french and chinese catholic priests were invited by the korean christians  
  
joseon royalty saw the new religion as a subversive influence and persecuted its earliest followers in korea culminating in the catholic persecution of 1866 in which 8000 catholics across the country were killed including nine french missionary priests the opening of korea to the outside world in the late nineteenth century brought religious toleration for the remaining catholics and also introduced protestantism via american missionaries beginning in 1884 the first protestant church in korea was established by seo sangryun and the first protestant missionary to enter korea was horace newton allen both events occurring in 1884 horace allen was a north presbyterian missionary who became an american diplomat he served in korea until 1905 by which time he had been joined by many others  
  
the growth of both denominations was gradual before 1945 in that year approximately 2 of the population was christian rapid growth ensued after the war when korea was freed from japanese occupation by the allies by 1991 184 of the population 80 million was protestant and 67 25 million was catholic wikipediahttpsenwikipediaorgwikichristianityinkorea

and then this

the christian missionaries who arrived in the 1800s and following have contributed much to the health education and general wellbeing of the south koreans christians were vocal in their support of the liberation of the korean peninsula from imperialist japan the establishment of schools hospitals orphanages and universities by the christians paved the way for the modernization of south korea joshua projecthttpsjoshuaprojectnetpeoplegroups12795ks

it is estimated that 30 of koreans in south korean are christian

what are they like

typical qualification that all people groups cant be summed up in small paragraphs and this is an over generalization

south korea boasts asias third largest economy exports of electronics automobiles and machinery allow the country to afford many conveniences of the modern world high rates of cable andor satellite television usage and highspeed internet connectivity make south korean a member of the cutting edge technology users of the world the country is also credited with pioneering the television via mobile devices and internet revolution  
  
distinct regional differences in culture and politics exist among the south koreans the most important regional difference is between the gyeongsang region in the southeast and the jeolla region in the southwest the two regions maintain a rivalry that reaches back to the fourth century ad the rivalry originated from a struggle for control of the peninsula interregional marriages are rare and travel between the regions in sparce despite a major highway connecting the regions since 1984 constructed for the specific reason of increasing interregional travel the highway has not served to improve visitation or commerce between the regions  
  
the political power elite have come largely from the gyeongsang region and consequently this region has benefitted most from government development assistance in contrast the jeolla region has remained comparatively rural and undeveloped  
  
regional stereotypes like regional dialects have been breaking down under the influence of centralized education nationwide media and several decades of population movement since the korean war stereotypes remain important in the eyes of many south koreans however each region has its own stereotypical beliefs about the other regions these beliefs may or may not be based in truth and accuracy joshua projecthttpsjoshuaprojectnetpeoplegroups12795ks

history lesson

the korean peninsula was inhabited as early as the lower paleolithic period the history of korea begins with the founding of joseon also known as gojoseon or old joseon to differentiate it with the 14th century dynasty in 2333 bce by dangun according to koreas foundation mythology gojoseon was noted in chinese records in the early 7th century gojoseon expanded until it controlled the northern korean peninsula and parts of manchuria gija joseon was purportedly founded in the 12th century bce but its existence and role have been controversial in the modern era in 108 bce the han dynasty defeated wiman joseon and installed four commanderies in the northern korean peninsula three of the commanderies fell or retreated westward within a few decades as lelang commandery was destroyed and rebuilt around this time the place gradually moved toward liaodong thus its force was diminished and it only served as a trade center until it was conquered by goguryeo in 313 wikipediahttpsenwikipediaorgwikichristianityinkorea

what do they believe

the dominant religions of south korea are christianity and buddhism despite the fact that most of the population express no particular affiliation with a religion south korea has the third largest number of professing christians of all the east asian and southeast asian countries  
  
there is a great deal of ambiguity in the practice and adherence to the belief systems that exist in south korea many people see religion as an inherited trait as much or more so than a faith also many south koreans practice elements of several belief systems christianity is the only faith that maintains distinct lines between those who belong to the belief system for the other religions it can be difficult if not impossible to know who practices what  
  
the korean church has had amazing growth in numbers and influence it was founded on sound indigenous principles blessed with a succession of revivals refined by persecution and is now one of the foremost in the world for missions vision its presence is highly visible every level of society has been impacted and growth has been remarkable of the 11 largest megacongregations in the world 10 are in the one city of seoul seoul also hosts the largest pentecostal presbyterian and methodist congregations in the world and the secondlargest baptist with over 15000 missionaries the korean church sends the secondhighest number of crosscultural workers to other parts of the world  joshua projecthttpsjoshuaprojectnetpeoplegroups12795ks

how can we pray for them

 pray that god will ignite passion for him and his word in the local christians
 pray they will evangelize the nation with the gospel of jesus christ
 pray they will spread the gospel and distribute bibles to oppressed nations in their region
 praise god for the amazing missionary vision of the korean church ask god to continue to raise up korean missionaries to go to the ends of the earth
 thank the lord for obedient servants who went to preach the good news
 thank the lord for a people group nestled in an area with so much unbelief surrounding it
 thank the lord for his constant provision to these people and to the missionaries that reached them
 pray for our nation the united states that we christians can learn to come alongside our hurting brothers and sisters and learn to carry one anothers burdens in a more christlike manner than we have done historically
 pray that in this time of chaos and panic that the needs of the unreached are not forgotten by the church pray that our hearts continue to ache to see the unreached hear the good news

brothers my hearts desire and prayer to god for them is that they may be saved romans 101

what is nugu while in korean it literally means who in the broader kpop context it refers to groups that are generally unknown amongst the greater public it doesnt have to mean theyre extremely new though it can and there are of course varying degrees of unknown which some groups having very strong niche fandoms and others being almost invisible i take a fairly broad view and will include groups that may be known to some but who dont have widespread name recognition

and now on to the show

  

dongkiz

who are they the dongkiz are a 5 member boy group under dongyo entertainment  their name means kids of the east with the east implying asia  their fandom name is dongari which means those lovesick with the dongkiz but can also translate to club  it was the result of a fan vote and narrowly beat the 2nd runner up ding dong  

company dongkiz seems to be the only group under dongyo entertainment  the company hasnt updated its sns accounts in a while and appears to have failed to pay their website hosting bill so its hard to find out much about them  theyve expressed a desire for dongkiz to help promote the hallyu wave overseas

let me introduce some of the rival matches that exist in the kbo league simply

i hope this will help you enjoy the game more

im not good at english please understand

x200b

 lg twins vs doosan bears jamsil series

mbc blue dragons forerunner of lg twins has been using jamsil baseball stadium since 1982 and ob bears forerunner of doosan bears has been using jamsil stadium since 1985 according to kbos plan ob bears was planning to move to another ballpark after using jamsil baseball stadium for about 3 years but the rivalry has began when the plan fell through and ob bears settled in jamsil stadium since then the fans of each team are arguing with each other claiming that their team is the owner of jamsil stadium

also this series is the kbos most concerned series the kbo reschedule the games so that the two teams must play on may 5in korea may 5 is a childrens day fans also think this game should never be lost for children fan and their pride some fans think it is more important than the korean series

total achievements  lg twins 311 wins 361 loses 17 draws  doosan bears 361 wins 311 loses 17 draws

doosan bears edge

 lotte giants vs nc dinos nakdong river series

this is a rival match between the two teams which nakdong river run across both team fans recognize each other as their biggest rival it is also said if there is a jamsil series in seoul there is a nakdong river series in gyeongsangdo

in 2011 nc tried to create a baseball team at this moment the lotte giants and samsung lions especially the lotte giants  were up in arms about it very strongly however due to public opposition lotte changed its opinion and nc dinos was founded even after this rival matches were created in earnest as fans began to squabble over big or small incident

total achieve ments  lotte giants 44 wins 66 loses 2 draws  nc dinos 66wins 44 loses 2 draws

nc dinos edge

 samsung lions vs lotte giants classic series

this series is the rivalry of two teams whose parent company hometown and team name have never changed since the first year of the kbo league samsungs composition of the squad or the investment of the parent company has always been superior to lottes but contrary to the expectation that samsung will win unilaterally it is a combination that has created many intense competition in important matches in 2016 under the agreement of both teams the name classic series began to be used in certain series both teams play in old uniforms

total achievements  samsung lions 403 wins 271 loses 15 draws  lotte giants 271 wins 403 loses 15 draws

samsung lions edge

 lg twins vs lotte giants lkkolsico

lkkolsico is a comparison of their match with el clsico it took its name from lgs l and kkolttelotte giants nickname derived from kkoljji which means the last

unlike the original the reason this series became famous is that lg twins and lotte giants give some big laughs to people by creating sublevel matches whenever they meet there are many extraordinary games such as the first uncaught third strike walk off in kbo league history or a twoday game so when this series is held some fans of other teams also watch this series to have great fun

total achievements  lg twins 345 wins 323 loses 21 draws  lotte giants 323 wins 345 loses 17 draws 

lg twins edge

there are quite a few rival matches besides this one so if youre curious look for it

gyeongsang,south koreas capital scraps testing mandate on foreigners,"this is the best tldr i could make originalhttpsabcnewsgocomhealthwirestorysouthkoreascapitalscrapstestingmandateforeigners76553271cidsocialtwitterabcn reduced by 57 im a bot

 the city will still recommend tests for foreigners employed at workplaces that are at risk of spreading infections such as bars and small factories said lee haeseon an official from the seoul metropolitan government

 the city of incheon and the provinces of gangwon south jeolla and north gyeongsang  areas that rely on lowwage migrant labor to sustain factories and farms  didn039t announce changes to their mandated tests on foreign workers

 quotthe point is that we are now recommending tests and no longer mandating themquot said lee the seoul official assuring that no foreigner worker will be fined for failing to get tested

 lone lines had snaked around designated testing stations in seoul after the city on wednesday began necessitating tests for all foreign nationals employed in the city regardless of their visa status or recent travel history

 seoul had around 240000 registered foreigners at the end of 2020 but city officials had no estimate of how many were under the test mandate

 on thursday british ambassador simon smith said his embassy told south korea039s national government the tests quotare not fair they039re not proportionate nor are they likely to be effectivequot he still advised british nationals in the area to be tested to avoid fines

gyeongsang,new coronavirus cases in south korea rises to 20,"south korea has now confirmed 20 new cases of the coronavirus including 14 people involved in an outbreak traced to several church services in the central city of daegu  


the spike in new cases is unprecedented so far in south korea and brings the number of people infected in the country to 51

including the cases announced on wednesday 19 have been reported in daegu and the surrounding north gyeongsang province with 16 of them tied to an earlier confirmed carrier koreas centers for disease control and prevention kcdc said in a statement

the earlier case was confirmed on tuesday in a 61yearold woman known as patient 31 she had no recent record of overseas travel but had attended church services and sought care at a hospital before being tested for the virus the agency said

now at least 15 people who attended religious services with patient 31 have tested positive for the virus

one other person who came in contact with her at a hospital has also come down with the disease

hundreds of people are believed to have attended services with patient 31 in recent weeks at a branch of the shincheonji church of jesus the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony a religious movement founded in 1984 by south korean lee manhee who is revered as a messiah by followers

on tuesday shincheonji church posted a statement on its website confirming the woman had attended services and advised its members to stay home it encouraged members who had attended meetings on 9 and 16 february to be tested and quarantine themselves

the daegu branch has been shut down since this morning and is conducting prevention measures the statement said

health authorities view the daegu case as a superspreading event kcdc director jeong eunkyeong told briefings on wednesday

besides the church patient 31 also visited a hotel and eventually a hospital daegu mayor kwon youngjin said in a facebook post

none of the womans family members have shown symptoms while taxi drivers who were in contact with her are now in selfquarantine kwon said

a clinic that treated patient 31 after a traffic accident on 6 february said she refused to be tested for the virus at that time despite a fever because she had not travelled abroad recently or been in contact with known patients

kcdc officials said they were reviewing policies governing people who refuse to be tested and added police could be involved in such cases

after her symptoms worsened she was finally tested for the virus on 17 february according to the kcdc

south korean president moon jaein has called for stringent infection control measures and every possible action to boost the economy which he said was in an emergency situation as the result of the epidemic

1 you have to use the standard language of jeolla province if by chance you happen to be found out to use words or accent of gyeongsang you might be assaulted by so called democratization
