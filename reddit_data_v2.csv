ulsan,travelling with 2 large suitcases from incheon to ulsan
ulsan,easiest way is probably airport express bus from incheon t1 or t2 to ulsan no problem to put 2 bags under the bus
ulsan,take the shuttle or bus from icn to gimpo gmp when you check in for your flight to ulsan usn show the korean air agent your eticket number from the flight to icn you wont have to pay for the second bag if you have a direct flight from gmp to usn if you are within 12 hours or something like that if you get unlucky and have to do what i just did i went from gmp to jeju to usn you will have to claim and recheck your bags in jeju at that point you will have to pay for the second bag
ulsan,oh cool was worried they had like a luggage limit thanks
ulsan,travelling from ulsan to gwangju
ulsan,inter city bus check kobus there are about 6 buses a day listed on there
ulsan,"if you take a combination of ktx or srt then you have to travel north to osong first to transfer net journey time on board might look like 2 hours 40 minutes but you add extra 20 minutes or so for transfer buffer plus ktx stations on both ends are far outside from respective city centers you lose more time on getting tofrom train stations

nonstop express bus should take 3 hours 40 minutes on average its definitely slower than ktxsrt in terms of crusing speed but bus terminals are closer to the city center in both cities therefore doortodoor journey time might as well even out

train ticket for your journey will be roughly 70 more expensive than express bus ticket unless you go for premiumgrade express bus"
ulsan,1 month trip to s korea what would you do
ulsan,if you have a lot of time definitely do jeju gyeongju for a night or two is good as well
ulsan,"jeju is a must its known for the black pork belly and hallabong oranges as well as the fresh seafood a lot of scenic places as seen from many kdramas cafes are pretty the roads along the ocean are perfect walking or biking ill be going again in april this time to see mt hallasan id recommend taking the kt to busan from seoul and then taking jeju air from busan to jeju best route if you are to go last year i went during hurricane season so busan and jeju were off the list i went to gangneung instead which is on the east side of seoul and also another hot vacation spot amongst koreans both are good options if you want to see the ocean 

ill also throw out japan most koreans also love going to japan since flights are cheap that is also a whole different country to explore if you have the time to go"
ulsan,"if its a day trip i would suggest incheon and suwon both places are really nice and if you havent been worth a visit 

if you like beaches i would recommended sokcho or gangneung gangneung is popular because of the bts bus stop and goblin filming location if it is something that interest you but my favourite is just enjoying the beach and the tofu village 

since you have been to busan why not try daegu or pohang a couple days at both places would be nice and you can also throw in a small busan trip to revisit it 

yeosu has a nice night market that as good food but 2 days 1 night would be enough 

of course jeju its a lovely place and great atmosphere you can do all the popular things i would suggest though you rent a car because it just makes your time there easier"
ulsan,     all recommended you can easily spend 5 days in  i would dedicate a day to hike 
ulsan,i would personally switch daejeon for gyeongju
ulsan,jeju is incredible do it
ulsan,jeju sokcho yeosu

ulsan,"saw your post about planning a 1 month trip to korea have you checked out this itinerary on there she goes again  
httpsthereshegoesagainorgkoreaitineraryonemonth  
the blogger does a great job of hitting most of the top spots across the country while minimizing travel time in between might give you some good ideas on how to structure your trip jeju and gyeongju are both great suggestions to add like others have said"
ulsan,"march to april is such a nice season to visit korea
i would spend more time in jeollado yeosu suncheon boseong for grean tea farm rather than gyeongsang ulsan or pohang 

if you are into traditional korean culture i would also recommend gyeongju or jeonju hanok village 

as other ops said jeju is a must dont forget to eat black pig"
ulsan,get a plastic surgery
ulsan,hey there what itinerary you ended up with i am also planning to visit south korea in april the first time and was wondering what people do if they around a month to spend
ulsan,is gyeonju possible as a one day trip without spending the night there 
ulsan,thanks anything you especially think we shouldnt miss in jeju i will look at gyeongju for sure i will also look at jeonju which i forgot to mention in my original post
ulsan,thanks so much for this yep we would love to eat the black pork belly and the hallabong oranges so even that alone probably seals the deal i will look into gangneeung we have been to japan a few times tho not for about 10 years i was just thinking i wanted to have the time to be flexible with seeing the cherry blossoms and i wouldnt be pleased if i had booked say a week in japan probably i would need to be thinking about booking that around now and then i somehow missed the cherry blossoms in sk but then also managed to somehow miss them in japan too 
ulsan,"thanks for this yes i was definitely planning a day in suwon will check out incheon

i do like beaches but i will be strolling by the beach in busan quite a lot will need to find out what the tofu village is tho i would like to see that hand at pohang but think it could be a bit of a faff on public transport 

thanks for the yeosu tip will research yes the general consensus here seems to be definitely a trip to jeju but without a car it can be a bit time consuming so we will look into getting a car thanks again that really helped"
ulsan,thank you
ulsan,i so enjoyed sitting with my feet in that hot springs thing in daejeon and i had my first icy cold noodles experience there  will look into gyeongju any specific recs you can give me thanks
ulsan,thanks will do our best
ulsan,thanks
ulsan,thanks yes ulsan is on our list now any specific recs for there if you have the time
ulsan,thanks so much for this such a helpful link
ulsan,thanks for this yes jeju black pig and jeonju are on our list yours if the first mention of suncheon and boseong so i will look into that enjoyed green tea based trips in taiwan so thats something were interested in
ulsan,is jeju good in marchapril and without a car
ulsan,thanks for your reply i cant say thats on my list  but each to their own
ulsan,"its possible if youre not going to bulguksa or 
seokguram i still stayed one night last time though even though i didnt go to those two places i would stay the night so you could see wolji pond at night"
ulsan,"it is possible as a oneday trip if you plan your journey efficiently although you will have to forgo some attractionsplaces that are far from the main cluster

i walked from the gyeongju intercity bus terminal and through the main cluster of attractions and ended at the wolji pond at around sunset just prior to when the lights are illuminated after having time to take in the night lights i then took a city bus back to the intercity bus terminal"
ulsan,its been quite a few years since i went to jeju and othersother posts will probably have better  recommendations i did like the short hike at seongsan ilchulbong gotta get some pork bbq there as well as some seafood osulloc tea farm was kind of crowded when i went but i guess it was kind of cool
ulsan,black pork belly is overhyped youll find out once u try it lol
ulsan,i think all the spots you want to visit are fairly close and easy to reach walkable even one of the only relaxing cities in korea
ulsan,"you for sure have to check out 

daewangam park its a bit far from the main area of ulsan but you can take a bus its so beautiful and the ocean view is nice

if you like museums you can go to the whale museum and whale watching as ulsan is known for its whales  but i heard it has to be a specific time where you can catch a glimpse of the whales

taehwagang bamboo forrest is a nice place for walking having a picnicresting is a very calming place maybe if you want to wind down and have a relaxing walk 

if you like litvibrant places check out the area mugeodong its mostly students who hang out there as its close to the uni but its very lively and you can find nice food places and rec things like karaoke batting cages arcades 

ulsan grand park is another one its a huge park and many things to see and do if you go i think its around may you can see the flowers they have its a huge display its very beautiful 

theres many more but these are my top picks for people to check out

hope this helps"
ulsan,im a big fan of pork belly so i would definitely try it what does overhyped mean in this context not worth the extra spend over normal pork belly or not as tasty as anticipated
ulsan,it definitely does thanks my oh company has a deal with a hotel group and they have one in ulsan so that will work great for us for a few days there
ulsan,"its just a lil more ex than normal pork belly so definitely try it but yes cant really taste a difference 

if youre in seoul try ggupdang kbbq enjoyed that the most"
ulsan,"thanks for this yep regular pork belly is pretty tasty when its done well so i can imagine its fairly hard to beat  i will make a note of that kbbq place thanks actually i just looked it up and found this interesting article  httpsdanielfooddiarycom20230406ggupdang

and im thrilled to read that the staff will do the cooking as when we have been before its a constant battle to get my oh to wait until the meat is actually cooked"
ulsan,"most of the kbbq places do the cooking for you not to worry d 

can check out seongsan ilchulbong for nice views theres even an hour hike up the mountain if thats something youre into can check out haeilri cafe there too its overlooking the sea"
ulsan,itinerary suggests for oct honeymoon
ulsan,kind of surprised you have not mentioned sinsa for high end fashion
ulsan,i hate the word hubby so much
ulsan,thank you for the suggestion googling away 
ulsan,"allow me to save you a step

ulsan,the hubby was very interested in this thank you again
ulsan,itinerary
ulsan,"moving around everyday will get very tiring you will be spending way more time transiting tofrom bus terminals and sitting on buses everyday than you think will you really even get to experienceexplore each spot if youre there less than 24 hours 

quality over quantity i would pick 3 areas and spend 34 days in each instead"
ulsan,removed
ulsan,"hi it looks packed but also some of them are pretty close to each other so i guess that for example suwon and korean folk village could be all in 1 day and gwangju could be a base camp for day trips to damyand bamboo forest and even mokpo

in 2019 i did the east coast sokcho gangneung gyeongju and busan and from busan i went to jeonju to then go back to seoul in 20 days this year will be doing andong hahoe cultural village busan and gyeongju again and then suncheon gwangju mokpo jeju so i cant say anything about these cities since i still havent been there but i can share my experience from the others

i personally loved gyeongju the most it is just not only beautiful but it has everything historically the tombs temples a korean folk village nerby and you can stay in a traditional hanok for good prices there are some hanoks there that are not expensive to stay in

as for gangeung i did not went to the beach we stayed just 1 day and it was to visit some historical sites it was quite nice but the buses at that area werent really frequent so keep that in mind if the idea of gangneung is going to the beach i hear is a good one

as for sokcho our priority was the seoraksan national park it was beautiful really worth it  we went to the beach at night and it was also really nice also one of my favorite places

jeonju it is really nice i think 1 full day is okay to walk around the downtown 

so my conclusion is i think if you have still 2 free days instead of adding more stops maybe try to add more days into the cities you already have and enjoy it because traveling everyday is quite tiring i think sokcho is worth to stay more than 1 day for example"
ulsan,removed
ulsan,thats a lot of time traveling  maybe pick 3 or 4 and enjoy the cities more
ulsan,deleted
ulsan,thanks i thought doing suwon and korean folk village seperately will give me more time at both i can always modify it spontaniously if there isnt that much to do in suwon
ulsan,i have been in seoul a total of 8 weeks i just search for other cities bc i know what i still want to do in seoul
ulsan,"self promotion without actively being a participating member of a sub is forbidden reddit wide and is against reddiquette

ulsan,"i am in korea for 4 weeks and have been there already before for 8 weeks i am a person that has a full itinerary so i will do that many cities 3 or 4 are way too less for 4 weeks for me

my problem is that it is hard to decide between the cities as there is less info that for example for seoul"
ulsan,"i am there for 4 weeks for this

i have been to busan before"
ulsan,11 cities in 12 days is nuts
ulsan,"last time i checked 4 weeks is not 12 days but 28

maybe i worded it wrong with labeling it 1day but i just asked if these cities are nice to travel tooworth it"
ulsan,"this adds up to 12 days  2 free days


1day suwon
1day korean folk village
1 day jeonju
1 day gwangju
1day danyang
1day mokpoyeosu
1day damyang bamboo forest
2 days gyeongju
1day gangneung
1day andong
1day sokcho
i still have 2 free days "
ulsan,travelling and driving in south korea
ulsan,"you need an international driving permit idp to rent here 

driving and navigation can be easy or hard depending on your korean level while the signs have english for the the korean names the gps usually doesnt so people do make wrong turns or take the wrong exit on the highway 

if you plan to drive give yourself double to triple the travel time stated to arrive at a destination because messing up a turn or exit can seriously delay you"
ulsan,"i used lotte rent a car and the gps is in english we had zero problem driving around for three weeks we just usually stayed away from the center of the cities we visited with the car and instead walked around you need an international driving permit issued by the authorities in your home country 

it was off season but we had zero problem finding a parking lot near where we were going and tourist attractions usually have their own parking lot

koreans can sometimes drive aggressively but if you have experience in big european cities it will be no problem"
ulsan,"driving in korea is fine when you are on the big roads as long as you can read the signs and use gps  the difficulty starts when you get off the big roads and start getting into alleyways and trying to park  i dont know what the situation is in austria but korea doesnt really have big parking lots where you can just drive in and the pick a place to park  rather most restaurants just have alleyways and certain unmarked spaces on the sidewalk in front of the store may be customer parking  but its hard to know if you are not a local  

mainly for this reason i find that driving is much more trouble than its worth and have never rented a car myself even though i visit korea every 2 years to see family  my suggestion would be for you to take public transit plane boat train bus to get from city to city and then to hire a local tour guide to drive you around the area  i would think the cost is not as bad as you might think plus the tour guide can show you places and tell you stories that you probably would not discover otherwise"
ulsan,"this is for jeju   

1 there are a lot of new drivers an the island as the local korean college students will go to the island for vacation and drive for the first time

2 unlike mainland korea jeju has a lot of roundabouts but the many of the visiting tourists do not know who has right of way and will enter the roundabout even when your already in it just keep this in mind and do not get to angry when it happens

3 getting into the smaller towns can be a hassle as some of the streets are not designed for vehicle use in case you can just park in the outskirts and walk to your destination"
ulsan,pohang what are you doing in pohang
ulsan,we rented a car in yeosu and returned it in pohang driving in pohang was rather hectic but it was great for getting out in the surrounding area heres a video httpsyoutubedq4pfetklkksiyeompcdjvswrbtw 
ulsan,hi thanks for the reply i actually want to rent car in pohang railway station and return in same branch then go by train to next city after busan fly to jeju and rent car again there in airport and again return before i fly to seoul  would that be an ok option
ulsan,"hi thanks for the reply i also plan to avoid city centers therefore only use cars around pohang and jeju i think i will not need in busan around seoul  
i do have a lot of experience driving inside the city  in vienna and also in between different cities in austria  like salzburg and many other cities and in autobahn too i do hope this will suffice 
i also see aggressive drivers here but try to calm and not get nerved by them
the international driving licence i will get this week i also do have a credit card to use in rental places do they require any limit in card do you know 
i also checked lotte car rental and notice the smallest car is for 5 people  since i will be alone  is there any options to rent smaller cars like smart"
ulsan,"hi thanks for the reply
actually i also do not intend to go really small alleys  rather go from one location to other and park car in a parking lot and so inside the city or villages i do hope to find parking lot options i do plan to use naver map in english as my language skills in korean almost zero except some common phrases from kdramas "
ulsan,i want to see filming locations of hometown cha cha cha and enjoy sea scenery
ulsan,wow thanks i will definitely watch it
ulsan,"with your experience youll be fine just learn the few basic rules that are different for example the traffic lights are tricky at first 
dont know about a card limit we paid about a million won for three weeks for lotte if you sign up for membership free you have a discount they do not have small cars but i dont think its only lotte they mostly have sedan cars in korea"
ulsan,i dont know what chachacha is  but theres a giant steel mill on the coast  i dont understand your numbers but its worth a day tops  you can make it a day trip from gyeongju
ulsan,i love this comment so much
ulsan,oh and they are installing roundabouts all over the country but they dont know how to use them they do not give way to the vehicles already in the roundabout so go slow and watch out
ulsan,hometown cha cha cha is a kdrama that is filmed in different locations of pohang i will do a day in geongju too but for me personally seeing pohang is more preferred
ulsan,ah thanks a lot i will definitely look out for it i am very well trained about them here sometimes i get also drivers who doesnt care about whonis in it who not 
ulsan,theres really not that much to see in pohang  space walk is cool  takes an hour  go to the beach   look at the ocean  look at the big steel mill  done
ulsan,ulsan to jinhae
ulsan,its 2 hours by express bus 
ulsan,april 5th might be pushing it for cherry blossoms
ulsan,really thanks i will have a look again
ulsan,hehe yes i think so but i read the full bloom started around 30th mar this year so im keeping my fingers crossed that it will be the same although i know its very much weather dependant
ulsan,korea entrytrip experience july 11th26th
ulsan,thanks so much for this detailed post can i ask  how did you handle stress in relation to the on arrival pcr test and potentially testing positive anything you did that helped how did you stay covid free prior to your trip and how did you mamage anxiety for your whole travel party i ask as i am very anxious about my upcoming trip
ulsan,"wonderful post it sounds like you had a blast im going to seoul and jeju next may with  friends and its always interesting to hear about transport and getting about on jeju 

i lost it at cafe magnate being owned by the father of some kpop artist poor jimin 

glad you had a great time hopefully the post blues wont hit you too hard"
ulsan,hii i have a question about always carry your passports  isnt it safer to leave it at hotel during sightseeing i am always afraid that im gonna lose it do i really need to have it with me everywhere i go
ulsan,thank you so much for this awesome trip report i enjoy the tone that it was written in and there is a lot of useful information to help me with my own planning
ulsan,this was nice to read thank you were going in late september cant wait
ulsan,there are numerous kakao apps which one are you referring to and what is it useful for
ulsan,"your submission was removed because covid related submissions are not allowed and must be put as comments on the weekly covidentryexit thread which is stickied to the top of this sub

i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subredditmessagecomposetorkoreatravel if you have any questions or concerns"
ulsan,tyvm
ulsan,"thanks for this regarding covid restrictions do you think they stopped you from doing something i guess besides just wearing masks indoors all should be fine right

i was thinking of maybe going in november im just a bit reluctant if they scale up their covid measures until there"
ulsan,good writeup glad you enjoyed
ulsan,great write up thanks
ulsan,thanks for the awesome trip report ive seen lots of these on rjapantravel but not too many here im heading to seoul in about 2 weeks glad to hear the process is pretty simple and smooth
ulsan,"thanks for sharing your experience loved reading about what you did day to day

i have a quick question did they check your name from your preflight test to your passport i got married and unfortunately my name on my passport is still my maiden name i am wondering if i will have to provide something to show the name change thanks"
ulsan,"thanks for the generous writeup an overnight wait in yyz is pretty brutal  there was another redditor who did the same on the same night maybe in your group but if not pretty unusual

its strange you were asked for arrivecan it says not needed httpswwwcanadacaenborderservicesagencyservicesarrivecanhtml but anyway if you create the account and upload docs it is easier to be prepped if you need to create an arrival record"
ulsan,thanks for this writeup i was wondering if after you landed at incheon your temperature was taken i have a layover in seoul in about a week on my way back to the us and im trying to figure out whether if you did land with covid symptoms they would make you quarantine in seoulat the airport or whether theyd send you back
ulsan,thanks for your great detailed post helpful and fun to read i am going to seoul from canada in a few weeks can you explain what you meant by myeongdong destroyed by covid
ulsan,i understood that you first had to do a covid test beforehand and another one after landing
ulsan,how did you manage to create a kakao account every time i try to verify my email they say suspicious attempt has been detected try again later
ulsan,"hi there i just saw this post thanks for sharing your experience

you mentioned that buses split can you please elaborate on that i am not sure i understand and how you figured the solution for this"
ulsan,hi so you said you had to fill out arrivecan because you have long layover in canada im just asking because we have a 3 hr layover from usa to seoul layover in toronto 
ulsan,thanks for the detailed post do you think i can get away with bringing a photo of my passport instead of carrying the actual passport
ulsan,i saved this post many months ago im finally flying on sunday  thanks for the helpful tips 
ulsan,how was the weather there was it unbearably hot and uncomfortable to be walking outdoors so much im going to korea in july too
ulsan,"i can relate i was super stressed about testing positive both on the pre flight test at cvs and at the post arrival test i only relaxed when we got the test results and we settled into our hotel 

before the cvs test we avoided going out for about a week which was a guess at an incubation period easy because of virtual working and we needed to clean out the fridge anyway but this way no unpleasant surprises hopefully youd notice covid before takeoff

another source of anxiety was the long layover since we had to sleep airside with all the people we played it as safe as we could but hopefully you dont need to deal with this

as for the big money i booked all our hotels via agoda which lets you cancel the vast majority of bookings with only 1 days notice i was planning on pulling the trigger on this if we tested positive pre flight 

our flights however werent cancelable due to being on a budget thus the long layovers i knew that there were some insurance policies that cover flight cancellation due to covid so i bought a policy for 200 usd online that also included health insurance etc typical travel insurance you can get a covid only policy for 80100 though i heard the ability to cancel things was pretty good for my psyche"
ulsan,i would like to know this too any measure you took while on the plane n95 face shield or in korea avoid public transit if possible
ulsan,"have fun on your trip hopefully by then covid things are more relaxed i miss it somewhat already x

and yes my sister hates me"
ulsan,you should keep your passport on you always also make a photocopy of it and keep in your roomsuitcase also give one to family back home this is to ensure easier time of you do lose it
ulsan,"legally yes your passport is the only acceptable form of id there we were asked for passport verification occasionally while out sightseeing although very rarely so you could probably get away with not bringing it

just be aware that its illegal just like jaywalking is illegal no one cares until someone does"
ulsan,i meant kakao t thats the taxi app if i said any other ones mb i explained about it in the post but being able to call taxis no matter where you are stuck in the middle of nowhere with the next bus in half an hour and being able to set the designation as someone who cant speak korean and thus found it hard to communicate addresses and names are both life savers
ulsan,covid restrictions didnt really stop us from going places  not as many places are closed as a few months ago and almost everything is open we felt comfortable going to places like street markets and stuff too  korea is good at being clean and conscious of covid
ulsan,"i dont know im not sure how closely they check but i do know that on the qcode form you have to provide both your test results with your name which they would presumably read and obviously your passport so they might see some difference

imo if they do deny your qcode for this reason the support staff are somewhat responsive although i think youd be better off bringing documentation and going through the manual line at incheon more time consuming but probably safer try qcode first though you might just get through and no problems"
ulsan,"thats funny lol and yeah yyz overnight was painful 

both baltimore and incheon asked for it at the check in counter and gate agents required it to board the plane seems like they want it just in case never actually needed to use it after that at the airport though i assume youd need to enter the country for that i was also surprised at the requirement"
ulsan,"our temperature wasnt taken although we werent showing any obvious signs of coughing or whatnot so maybe they just didnt want to stop us and ask i didnt see any stations for covid symptom monitoring 

during our initial covid test landside they asked us once again if wed had any covid symptoms but we didnt 

btw correct me if im wrong but i believe that if you are just doing a layover in seoul and not actually leaving airside you shouldnt ever go through a covid check at all this only should happen if you try to exit the airport and pass through immigration if youre going to go landside for an overnight hotel or something though im not 100 sure about symptom testing as wed already stated no symptoms in qcode etc but personally nothing happened to us"
ulsan,myeongdong a common tourist shopping area a lot of stores and restaurants shuttered during covid due to lack of traffic and theres not much locals thus its dead to be fair i hear its been doing much better lately with the reopening and the passing of the initial slow period due to monsoons and heat
ulsan,yes thats correct
ulsan,not sure it just worked for me maybe it depends on the device and whether your ip is public not sure
ulsan,"hello by buses splitting i mean for one bus line say 340 2 different route 340 buses will travel the same stops for the first 10 stops but then start doing different stops on two different roads leading out of an intersection 

we never ended up figuring out a solution like i mentioned in the post all the relevant solutions typically involve speaking korean i think the only other way is to strictly only use buses on a timetable created by a directions app like naver as they know better"
ulsan,no it seems irrelevant of your layover you must fill out arrivecan as long as you plan to transit through it
ulsan,im not sure if that works  i assume you mean digitally you can consider asking someone when you get to korea if youre allowed to do this as i imagine airport officialsetc are much more proficient in this than i am no harm in asking after all sorry i couldnt help
ulsan,hope it helps still im not sure how much things have changed since then 
ulsan,"it wasnt actually that bad when we were there in terms of heat since it was a relatively cool year and the rain was sweeping away a lot of the heat but the humidity was really crazy especially on jeju island im not sure about this year and think you will probably get a better answer from your weather app than me

i hope the weather is good and that you have a nice trip"
ulsan,"we wore kn95 masks on the plane rides in fact the entire trip and we double layered masks on the international flight i was scared of toronto because of the busy nature of the airport and our long layover hoping we wouldnt get covid and ruin our trip

but no face shields and we took public transit a lot in korea korea itself was very clean and everything was sanitized so wasnt worried about covid

we self administered a rapid test in the middle for the recommended 67 day test to feel safe and it turned out negative"
ulsan,thank you
ulsan,"that is very helpful thanks 

yes i might stick to naver maps then did you find the buses are on time i will most likely rely on bus numbers and times to know if i am on the right one because it takes me some time to read hangul"
ulsan,thanks that makes me feel much bette 
ulsan,yes the buses are on time naver actively tracks buses as well so you can see exactly how far away they are and when theyll come as well
ulsan,excellent thank you so much
ulsan,heres our itinerary
ulsan,"your schedule seems way too packed for example you could easily spend a half or whole day at the national museum alone the dmz is a whole day trip i would go back to the drawing board and do some more research on how far away places are how big they are etc

edit also i wouldnt go to jeonju just to visit the hanok village it is not that historical anyways you can get your fill of hanok at bukchon hanok village i recommend a tour of baek inje house i think you need a reservation to see the inside"
ulsan,if shes into dancingthis was a hit with my friends teenagers when they came to visit  kpop dancehttpswww1milliondancecom
ulsan,"have you pinned everything on navermap this will help you organise things that are closer together to do on the same day itll also help if youre using public transport too
youtube and tiktok will give you names of kpop stores and their locations  seoul forrest isnt listed this is near the sm building if your daughter likes idols from that company the forrest also has benches for bts seventeen etc if youre looking for a free activity"
ulsan,"hi would you know what groups your daughter likes if she likes artists from sm entertainment you can add kwangya located near seongsu to your list for kpop shops theres withmuu in myeongdong and hongdae

theres also the kidol road in gangnam that has statues for some older groups some restaurants also have signatures of the artists so it might be worth looking into restaurants that her favorite artists visited good luck and have fun"
ulsan,"thanks for the tip will ditch hanok then and look into baek inje house

were pretty flexible on sights can see how it goes as we go dmz were going for a half day tour  early start so should be back by 230 latest and im pretty relaxed with museums dip in for a couple of hours see the highlights 

reality is we cant see everything in as much depth as id like but better to have a quick look whilst were there than skip it in order to deep dive something else"
ulsan,thanks have shared although i think she only likes sitting down dancing in the car 
ulsan,"great thank you 

pinned stuff on google maps but have kakao and naver for live navigation"
ulsan,thanks were in seoul now withmuu looks good  but doesnt open till 11 
ulsan,help with 14 day itinerary in skorea seoulsokchoseoraksangeyongjuseoul
ulsan,"1 yes i think gyeongju can be done in 2 days as long as youre arriving early in the morning and late at night the one day might be better spend near seoul


2 no particular reason i could think of do whatever that fits you better


3 this depends on which trail youre going on seoraksan keep in mind weather in seorak can be an ass and any mountain with rak or ak in its name means its difficult"
ulsan,thinking of doing the dinosaur ridge  either as one long day or two shorter ones were not technical climbers but have hiked all around the world and our pace is pretty quick by most peoples standards
ulsan,"oooh dinosaur ridge is beautiful but also hard710 hour course and weather can change rapidly as well


if you decide to do this just be prepared with water snacks extra layers 


i asked my dad who is way more experinced hiker than me in his words not many people but difficult and either you start hiking in the early morning were talking like 34am or you spend a night in the shelter keep in mind sleeping elsewhere in the mountain is illegal he also recommended having someone whos experinced along when attempting and cautioned winter attempt is dangerous and would rather do it in summer"
ulsan,8 weeks trip in korea
ulsan,sounds like an incredible trip thanks for the overview i heard horror stories too especially about tattoos and my friend and i have full sleeves and i have small hand and a neck tattoos my mate is trans and 50 and im female over 60 everyone was so friendly especially elderly women who were constantly asking about my purple hair and a tattoo on my arm which is in hangul we hung out in itaewon and whilst we didnt try queer spaces given our ages we loved the neighbourhood i spent a week traveling by myself and had a wonderful and very safe time i keep saying to people now dont believe the bad stuff theres people that wont like you everywhere so ignore them and enjoy
ulsan,what a delightful summary of your experience d
ulsan,"it was  im glad to hear that you and your friends experiences werent negatives either i went to itaewon but it felt a bit empty it was the weekend before the birthday of last years events so i dont know if it played a part into this or if its because i went around 11pm 

honestly yes you cant please everyone i definitely got a few old people take a weird look at my tattoos but people usually ignore you or dont pay much attention so do the same and everything will go well"
ulsan,thank you im bad at summarises but glad you liked it haha
ulsan,busan to jeonju
ulsan,"just check on korail websiteapp wrt the timings of trains to get a better idea

edit theres a direct bus to jeonju from busan in case you dont want to switch trains"
ulsan,"making horizontal trip by train at the south of korea isnt a good idea because theres no express rails yet what youre seeing is the fastest route by rail which requires you to move northbound

expressintercity bus is the way to go busan bus terminalnear nopo subway station definitely has buses that goes to jeonju"
ulsan,usually theres a 2030 minute layover between trains when you transfer  station is small and you dont need lots of time to find your platform the direct bus is more convenient though
ulsan,didnt realize there was a direct bus thank you so much
ulsan,thank you so much i will look into that
ulsan,and where i can see the route of this bus in terms of landscape is a plus going by bus to busan thanks
ulsan,landscape wise buses are definitely better
ulsan,less common recommendationscities
ulsan,"number 1 would be jeju if you enjoy hiking absolutely nothing in the mainland compares to the 27 olle trails in your shoes id spend 2 of my 5 weeks there      

here are others in relation to your timeframe and where youve been suncheon donghae yang yang gangneung jirisan chuncheon ulleungdo and gochang   

also dont cross out places youve been to i guarantee youve probably missed something huge the petroglyphs of ulsan the tripitaka koreana of gayasan near daegu the seowon of andong the list goes on     

like you i went somewhere almost every weekend for about 4 years with my now wife so have been to almost every place in korea in 2019 i made a list of every place that i couldnt visit on a weekend and rented a car  i took a a month long road trip to visit those some highlights include koreas best temple unjusa 4 days to deeply explore ulleungdo and a visit the the rural areas of boseong and central korea in 20202021 i lived in jeju    
these days i just go back to places i liked for events or make a point to visit places i missed the first time"
ulsan,"tongyeon and geoje are both nice but a car makes life easier geoje has nice stone beaches 

i only spent a night in mokpo it was fine but we just drank theres an official f1 or something race track there so there may be races theres also a go kart track that was fine

im gonna throw gangneung into your travel recommendations east coast nice beaches close to the mountains too a little south is a temple overlooking the ocean  unification park i think thats how you spell it they have an nk sub that ran into a sandbar in the 90s there last time i went you were allowed to go on it too further south is donghae tbh skip it though there are some caves in the middle of the city and  commonly known as penis park worth the visit"
ulsan,"mokpo danyang damyang geoje suncheonboryeong chuncheon gangneung ulleungdo paju suwon jejudo seogwipo jeju city and udoseongsan gapyeong namiseom ganghwado are my recommendations

for hiking mokpo mount paldal and then you could cable car to nearby gohado suwon scaling around hwaseong fortress walls perimeter ganghwado for the ancient fortress and temple trails jejudos sanbangsan seongsan ilchulbong hallasan and udobong

for walking around mokpo downtown danyangs eight views and gosu cave damyangs bamboo forest and river geoje island suncheon for the wetlands and boryeong for the tea fields though it could also be considered hikes chuncheon downtown gangneung downtown and its beaches ulleungdo gapyeongs nami island paju downtown suwon downtown jeju city dongmun area and seogwipo city downtown

geoje island gangneung specifically jeongdongjin beach on the beach line mugunghwa train jejudo udoseongsan are the perfect sun basking destinations because of the numerous beaches and beach walks"
ulsan,"i would say tongyeong and around hallyeohaesang national park ive had great hikes and views there if you like seaish environment youll love it

also the seoraksan national park near sokcho and a bit south of sokcho you have some surfing spots if youre into that"
ulsan,"did you hike mudeungsan while in gwangju going from base to peak and back takes 68 hours and theres a dozen different trails that take you into hwasun or damyang 

also mokpo is great for a coastal city visit and damyang is a stunning sleepy city that also offers so many hiking trails"
ulsan,thanks for the recommendations i forgot to include jeju on my list i was there for a week last year in october it was my number one city for a revisit anyway but you basically convinced me i also have no doubt i missed stuff though i will have to see how my planroute turns out in fact i did miss all 3 places you mentioned above though something like the seowon of andong from the pictures doesnt look like it would be worth ti for me to return for it tbh
ulsan,thanks for the recommendation i heard of the penis park d but i will admit if they are kinda out somewhere  as in not close to a city i miss these things because these random unique spots are just kinda hard to connect for me without a car
ulsan,thanks for all the recommendations i once again notice how little i have seen of sk i mentioned the sun basking because  well it is the season after all i guess i go for the normal tourist stuff like anyone else but as i tried to indicate above by now the templesold buildingsmuseums just kinda look too similar tbh
ulsan,i have been at the seoraksan national park when i was in sokcho it was the main reason i went there to be honest d  yeah the thing with anything on namhae for me was when i looked into it some months earlier buses seemed to be running rarely so back then i went to other cities that seemed easier 
ulsan,i did hike there for one day yes but i never heard anyone mention damyang to be honest and it could be a potential stop if i go for mokpo
ulsan,its harder to get to without a car for sure but still accessible by transit and walking maybe a reason to hit up donghae and use it as a base for the weekend
ulsan,"i mean they kinda are because there is very few sects of korean buddhism left its like 80 of the temples are affiliated with the jogye order those that look pretty unique are often affiliated with a different sect or are more original if you didnt know the japanese destroyed temples all across the country in the span of their entire occupation of the country from annexation to 1945 some were destroyed during the original invasion in the imjin war or were bombed by the americans and north koreans during the korean war right after wwii ended even the palaces are recreations of the original palaces most historical sites were rebuilt remote temples like haeinsa tongdosa haedong yonggungsa ganwolam among a few others survived some of the worst of korean history

x200b

also i had like a decade of living and journeying around korea i just came back from tongyeong and i truly recommend that city for night tourism and walking around it was great"
ulsan,train tickets over chuseok
ulsan,"you are sol  you wont beat locals out of train tickets  there is no scenario where you would win that 

make a new plan  

chuseok is extended this year due to a 2d holiday it will be 28th through the 3rd with travel being difficult during that time and the day before and day after"
ulsan,"you can salvage your trip by adjusting your plans for example arrive in incheon and use public transportation subway bus to get around 

instead of exploring korea geoje busan andong gangwondo etc by ktx or long distance bus explore seoul in depth

could you instead use the extensive seoul metro subway lines to explore the neighborhoods within seoul and parts of gyeonggido

hongdae myeongdong yongin suwon mapo gu gangnam jamsil incheon etc"
ulsan,"it is said that you can easily get a ticket by using an app like yanolja in a way that even koreans are not familiar with

if you use a bus it is recommended to use the banpo express bus terminal  
however caution is needed as the process can be complicated"
ulsan,i am travelling to busan on the 5th oct from seoul would it be difficult to get ktx ticket on this day as well
ulsan,no people will be back at work
ulsan,after the 4th it should be all good
ulsan,thanks a lot this really helps
ulsan,thanks this was really helpful
ulsan,unplanned journey during chuseok holiday
ulsan,seoul is definitely not empty in fact many popular places are very busy
ulsan,the korail website is best for the mungunghwa but the ulsan line only runs to busan or daegu id recommend taking a bus instead and visiting jeonju and yeosu or tongyeong
ulsan,dont travel during chuseok stay put or go somewhere close trains and buses are likely all booked
ulsan,i see thats a new information are there any places that get special attention during chuseok
ulsan,"just recently here someone posted about namsan tower but you could walk up to it and be ok lotte world also gets busy and i suspect worse this weekend  not sure about the palaces  

im not positive about towns in the countryside but you may find less open and many people go from seoul to the countryside during this time so its not that it will be less busy there either"
ulsan,14day itinerary check  seoul jeju busan and gyeongju
ulsan,how was the pace for you were thinking of the same itinerary and destinations also doing it in 14 days
ulsan,"i found it pretty well paced we got to see most of what we had planned with some minor changes but didnt feel like we were missing out on anything we even had one less day than planned in jeju because on the last one we got heavy rain but we saw the forecast beforehand and decided to scrap udo island so were able to squeeze the rest of the attractions in two days we also did gyeongju in 2d1n because of the availability of flights to japan so we had one less day in korea

i would have liked to stay in seoul in straight days instead of leaving and going back in order not to waste so much time going tofrom the airport but it wasnt possible in our situation the one day i felt was a bit overwhelming was the one that we did gyeongbokgung bukchon hanok village and changdokkgung complex in one day the palaces are pretty big some of the buildings are very similar to each other and it was close to the end of our trip so by the end of the day we werent enjoying all that much since we were a bit tired apart from that we really enjoyed our time in korea good luck with your trip"
ulsan,3 week itinerary help
ulsan,"that is way too much moving around in my opinion you will spend almost as much time waiting at bus terminalstrain stations and sitting on said busestrains as you would sightseeing and thats not even considering coordinating checkincheckout times at hotels commuting tofrom hotels and bus terminals etc it just ends up being a bunch of wasted time to go to places that arent really that much different from each other  from a tourists standpoint 

take out pohang ulsan daegu and daejeon you wont be missing out on anything special in these cities spend more time in busan and yeosu dont bother with stopping in changwon if you were planning on it gwangju is cool so stop there or jeonju for a couple nights on your way back to seoul"
ulsan,"we took our two kids for 3 12 weeks and did a whole road trip yeosu to pohang and ulleungdo it was pretty exhausting but a lot of fun we rented a car

we really enjoyed hyangiram hermitage in yeosu which does involve some hiking"
ulsan,damn i did not consider all that thats true the waiting and the checkin times are going to take up time daegu and daejon were not originally on my list but i felt i had time cool il just extend that in busan or yeosu thank you ulsan i have to go i an really excited about the whale watching  thank you i was worried i am being over ambitious with my itinerary 
ulsan,oh hey korea with kids i think i saw your youtube video when deciding on my itinerary it was really helpful thank you
ulsan,very cool 
ulsan,planning a trip to busan and the surrounding area should i stay in busan the entire time and travel out from there or stay the night at other places
ulsan,"is there any reason or something particular you want to see in daegupohangulsan how many days are you staying in busan what time of year

if youre travelling lightly it would probably make more sense to just spend a night in each place to cut down on the amount of time youre sitting on a bustrain if you have lots of heavy luggage then staying in busan and doing day trips might be better so youre not carrying heavy bags around everywhere 

i would recommend taking at least a couple days to check out geoje though okpo is a fun little area most of the scenic places and beaches are kinda far out by bus though so youre kinda at the will of the bus schedules i had to use kakaotaxi a couple times to get back to the hotel cause i got tired of waiting at bus stops 

also tongyeong is worth the trip as well and is next to geoje"
ulsan,"everywhere in korea can be done in one day technically ive seen lots of people including daegu ulsan gyeongju while staying in busan

if you plan to move outside of busan staying at seomyeon is best bet

check out my busan guide for more information httpswwwredditcomrkoreatravelcommentsy3ewzbaguidetobusanfromselfproclaimedbusanloverutmsourceshareutmmediumiosapputmnameiossmf"
ulsan,"it depends on how willing you are to travel for long periods of time per day personally when i was younger id make those day trips these days though id probably stay 1 night per place or something like that   

must see the petroglyphs in ulsan for me but thats a personal interest that not many share"
ulsan,"im mostly just trying to see as much as i can while im there but im not sure if im cramming too much in at once ill be travelling down this friday and staying until new years day so i can catch the sunrise so 8 full days plus the two travel days

im currently living in seoul to study so i can pack light in which case i guess it would smart to stay in some of the areas"
ulsan,this guide is fantastic i need friends like you to help me plan my itineraries for trips like this because im terrible at it lmao thanks so much for your help ill definitely be checking out some of the places in your guide
ulsan,the petroglyphs sound interesting im a big fan of historical sites so ill have to see if i can squeeze those into the itinerary too
ulsan,cool sounds like lots of time id probably go overnight instead of going back and forth each day then you can work your way back up to seoul that way
ulsan,19 days trip suggestions help
ulsan,"ill tell you a few words if im not too involved in your trip

i think seouljejubusanother regionsseoul is a desirable route

its okay to use an airplane from seoul to jeju and a ship from jeju to busan

if you take a boat at night from jeju you can arrive in busan the next morning which is a way to save one day of accommodation

august is the peak season so you have to make a reservation 1 to 2 months in advance

take ktx when you come back to seoul from busan

since seoul is a big city and has been the capital of korea for a long time you will be able to experience many things such as shopping sightseeing food museums and history

gyeongbokgung palace is a symbolic palace in korea

i recommend you to visit

it will be a fun memory because you can rent hanbok near gyeongbokgung palace

jeju is a city of recreation so about 4 nights is appropriate

but jeju island in august is a tourist season

you can get tired due to flight reservations accommodation reservations high prices etc

i recommend black port bbq and seasonal sushi for jeju food

transportation is not a wellequipped area so you have to spend a lot of time traveling

i want to oppose it for 4 days in busan so its complicated and theres not much to seetheres only youth on the beach in busan

i recommend gyeongju which is not far from busan

it takes half a day to get back from busan and has a lot of cultural history

hwaseong fortress is good in suwon but thats all about suwon

sokcho gwangju yeosu and tongyeong are too far from your route

try new food if possible

i cant recommend your food because i dont know your taste

if possible i would like to go shopping in seoul

please purchase the gift items in jeju or use the dutyfree shop

seouls history museum war memorial hall and dmz tour would be good for the museum

the water park is about a 3hour drive from seoul

everland water park is the most used facility

there is also a shuttle bus running in seoul

other areas have famous water parks

it is also okay to visit jeju citys 5day market which opens only on the 2nd 7th 12th 17th 22nd and 27th of every month

its okay to go to namdaemun market in seoul namdaemun market is famous for braised cutlassfish

the most famous beaches are jungmun beach in jeju island and haeundae beach in busan

the accommodation in seoul is a place where many tourists gather but i dont want to recommend it

hongdae is young but i dont like it because its messy and not tidy

anyway i dont know if thats the answer to what youre curious about

if you need more information please comment and i will share everything i know

depending on how far youre going to see and what youre going to experience

i think it can be a long time or a short time

trying to experience too much can lead to failure

i hope you plan well and have a good trip

ulsan,"i went to seoul and busan in august last year and going again this year all i can say is make sure you carry fluids it gets really really hot and humid 

however when i got there there was a big heatwave going on so maybe it wont be as bad this year 

there are a lot of historical sites in busan if you enjoy hiking the mountains in busan are littered with walls lookouts gates fortresses and the view at the top of them are amazing"
ulsan,hi thanks so much for all the detail and recommendations super helpful i had no idea you could take a boat to jeju i think i will do 3 days in busan instead of 4 and ill check out everland water park
ulsan,recommendations for a seasoned traveler
ulsan,"ulleungdo  we went with our two kids and it was amazing  
i want to hike naeyeonsan north of pohang which has 12 waterfalls  juwangsan also looks really cool"
ulsan,what do you recomend for a  12 days trip first timer
ulsan,im not sure if its a historical site naju image theme park  is artificial joseon village used for the shooting of historical kdramas it should be open for visitors to roam the village
ulsan,ah yes i always forget about ulleungdo definitely need to find the time to get out there eventually and ill check out those mountains thanks
ulsan,well i guess it depends if youre willing to move around the entire country or if you want to stick to a regionlast winter a friend and i used the korail pass to explore the north east coast sokchogangneungsamcheoketc for 9 days by train but im sure it could be condensed if you want to explore another region as well id need some more info to give useful advice haha
daejeon,traveling from seoul to daejeon where my hotel is at on the first day
daejeon,yes you can i arrived and caught the train to busan then got my pcr test done in busan on the same day i arrived
daejeon,hello everyonemy keta was nullifiedhow to apply again
daejeon,thank you also do you know of any mastercard atms in icn thanks
daejeon,i didnt have a problem with my citibank card in most places unsure what cards you have and what country your are from which also matters

daejeon,a guide to koreas trains from a guy who really like trains
daejeon,op just want to say this is a top quality post posts like this are why i come to reddit this will be very useful next time we visit korea particularly as the last time we were there it was 2001 and there were far fewer train options we took the midnight crazy bus chain smoking driver speeds seemingly approaching 150kph slaloming all over the highway from seoul to busan thanks for sharing your wisdom
daejeon,"i love the map on 2

about 8 years ago i saw this map in gangneung station iirc i asked the dude if he had extras and if i could have a copy he said okay sure went to the back and never came back lol   

anyways top 5 posts ive ever seen on here ill find a way to add it somewhere"
daejeon,"thanks for the comprehensive writeup always nice to see aficionados writing articles as they are full of details

anyway also wanted to seek your opinion if i want to get to busan from incheon airport should i take ktx from gwangmyeong or seoul cant seem to find much difference other than it being faster from gwangmyeong although it has less frequent ktx trains"
daejeon,this is an awesome post op have saved it so i can revisit thank you
daejeon,this is so cool thanks for compiling all this info trains are so fascinating
daejeon,for the joined trains during rush hour how can you tell if it is a joined train and how do you distinguish which part of the train you go on for example if my ticket says 55a is there only one car 5 to go onto

im looking at a way from seoul to daecheon with transfer at asan of 12min is is really sufficient  or too just "
daejeon,this is such a great post i have a question i am taking the itx from busan to cheonan does the itx leave from busan station like the ktx and srt or does it leave from a different station i got my tickets off the korail app and it just says busan
daejeon,i was watching a video of ktx and thought to myself wow it looks a lot like acela and frances tgv mostly because i guess like acela ktx was based on tgv now i know for sure haha little disappointing since i feel like the train set fronts arent narrow or sleek enough but tgv is an older but proven design im sure unlike america though  of koreas rail the high speed train sets are running are electrified
daejeon,nuriro
daejeon,would be interesting to see what you have to say about ktxcheongryong 
daejeon,small addendum as far as electrical and usb sockets and as well as wireless phone charging goes  check this articlehttpskorearailwaycomenrechargingserviceattrainstationsandtrains out
daejeon,hi great post learned a lot through this but still have some doubts i have upcoming trip end oct and from icn airport i plan to go directly to daejeon i understand tix are available from one month of the intended date and may most of the time gets sold out i see tickets for 05oct morning already ran out so i have tried booking ticket online and via app just to prepare how to proceed when it is already a month from my travel date however on reservation it is asking me a password do i just input the password i want or do i need to make my own account but i also read it needs a korean phone number which i will not have until i arrive in south korea hope you can provide help thanks in advance
daejeon,"when you reserve ktx tickets on letskorailcomhttpletskorailcom  is the reservation valid for the specified time only or the entire day like in some western european countries  
my flight will land at 9am on a friday at icn airport clear immigration then shuttle bus 6770 to gwangmyeong i could add 2 hours of buffer but that potentially means waiting for 2 hours at gwangmyeong station

also from gwangmyeong to busan which is a better experience ktx or ktxsancheon assuming timing is good"
daejeon,"would i experience the 260305 kph of ktx train if im just heading to suwon station from seoul station the trip is 30 minutes there will be one stop in between

but i also checked the cheaper expressitx trains and i suppose slower but the travel time is just also 30 mins same as the ktx

i also checked the ktx going to daejeon from seoul without stop in between which only takes one hour while the expressitx trains with some stops in between take almost 2 hours"

to clarify is the ktxchungyong you mentioned here the same as ktxcheongryong thank you in advance"
daejeon,"how many stations are they going to rename 


singyeongju to gyeongju  that will teach me to use an old map

we are going 
seoul  jeonju
jeonju  busan 
busan  seoul"
daejeon,quick question from a first time traveller to korea is there any need to prebook train tickets talking for example ktx from seoul to busan can we just go to the station whenever and buy a ticket for lets say the next hour or should this be done a few days in advance for economy or standing not first class
daejeon,"as a foreigner ive been trying to buy korail tickets on letskorail with foreign issued visa card and a master card but the 3d secure  has been blocking the transactions despite being on the phone for 30 minutes each with visa and mastercard

thank you for your detailed post about the trains"
daejeon,"is the rail ninja website legitimate in getting ktx tickets planning to travel from seoul to busan busan to gyeongju via bus and gyeongju back to seoul 

i dont have large intercity rail where im from so how much time should i set aside to move around in seoul station check in is that a thing and board the train"
daejeon,thank you for the very helpful post it states that for ktx you can only choose your seats as a foreigner if you book in person  i am trying to book first class seats where my mum and i can be seated next to each other so i should wait till i get to korea or it will randomly assign us if i book online we arrive in korea only about 6 days before we need the train to busan so im just concerned about things selling out as busan is going to be busy for the bts concert  what do you recommend thank you 
daejeon,"i saw your post said group purchase of ktx tickets on the computer shows a page that tells you to contact korail on the phone but when im on the korail website now it seems like i can go all the way to checkout as a foreigner when trying to buy 2 tickets and they are seating the two next to each other i havent actually bought the tickets

anyway my question is im going to buy tickets for the 505am ktx seoul to pohang i dont want to be late so i want to get to the station early but is the seoul ktx station closed before that when does it open every morning"

seoul to busan seated

day 2

busan to seoul seated

x200b

i understand that for the seated tickets reservations have to be made

for the standing tickets do i also have to make reservations or can i just get on the train with my korail pass"
daejeon,thank you for this detailed post im hoping you can answer this question as i have looked everywhere for an answer but i am at a loss i am a foreigner and i just purchased a korail flexible pass online i have a child under 6 but i want to get him his own seat but when i enter his birthday it doesnt allow me to purchase the pass for him because he is under 6 but i want to buy the korail pass and reserve tickets in advance so we can sit together i havent yet arrived in korea so i cant go to a ticket counter in person if i go ahead and use an incorrect birth year so i can buy his pass online do the attendants check details like that great post thanks again

daejeon,"if you have lots of luggage or have someone who has difficulty moving take the airport shuttle to gwangmyeong takes about hour if i remember correctly

if not take the direct arex to seoul station takes about 50 minutes

shuttle is a bit more expensive but has shorter transit time but youre right gwangmyeong has less frequent ktx trains

while arex has longer transit times between arex and ktx around 15 minutes depending on which platform ktx is but its easier to plan your trip and more frequent cheaper as well and all ktx trains stop at seoul station so more options"
daejeon,the one in front has car number 18 the one in behind has 916 so theres only one car 5 but which one is the front may be confusing so always check before you get on
daejeon,"theres no dedicated spot for luggage for mugunghwa except for overhead space that has space for typical carry on baggage on a airplane for larger luggage if you sit on the way back or very front of the car you might be able to squeeze in your luggage at the extra space

or you can put it between coach cars but either you keep an eye on it or it will be left unattended"
daejeon,"not at all i assume transfer at asan is between mugunghwamaum or itx and ktx or srt

because the the latter stops at cheonanasan station while youre heading to asan station these two stations are connected they act more like separate platforms rather than separate stations

once you get off at asan if you look around on platforms you should see sign saying this way for ktx or srtalso written in english follow that

15 minute rule is to give enough buffer between transfers although youre at 12 min seoulasan is too short for trains to accumulate significant delays should be 2 minutes at most likely none at all

overall im not too worried about it and youll be fine"
daejeon,if it says busan station its referring to busan station and not other stations within busan itx also leaves from some other stations in busan such as gupo station but in your case its busan station
daejeon,"not just hsr almost entire rail network of korea is electrified and those that arent are planned for electrification

recently theyve been pumping money into rail infrastructure between mokposouthwest end and busan southeast end which really makes sense and makes me wonder why havent we done this before

on the amtrak note i feel like acela is a missed opportunity what amtrak really needs is a dedicated passenger rail network"
daejeon,never rode on one i mean its newer than mugunghwa it was imported from japan was considered a replacement for mugunghwa never went through due to high budget so only few trains are in service
daejeon,"yes you create a password when booking this is used to confirm that its you if you need to modify your reservation

  
i dont believe it asks for a phone number are you on the official app korailtalk"
daejeon,"the ticket is valid for that train only if you get on a different train time it cannot be used

  
sancheon is newer so better but difference in minimal that i would get on whichever works for your schedule"
daejeon,"no ktx trains that makes a stop at suwon runs on the normal rail until daejeon hence the same travel time

however daejeon and seoul is connected via high speed rail so its much faster connecting suwon to high speed rail is underway but it will take few years"
daejeon,yup same thing think i made a huge set of typos
daejeon,"no clue but this station takes the cake of being the weirdest

httpsenwikipediaorgwikigwaebeoprenecitestationhttpsenwikipediaorgwikigwaebeoprenecitestation"
daejeon,"im looking for to book a seat online on the korail website for a train ride on december 28 but its kept showing no trains is it opened for advance booking during new year holidays 

im also planning to take ktx train from busan to seoul on new year eve in worst case that all seats are fully booked can i still get a standing ticket do i need to get to the ticket booth for the ticket i wont buy a korail pass will it also become fully booked 

x200b

thank you so much for your great article"
daejeon,"he mu is still around but it was a prototype at best ktxeum is actually based on hemu

theres another ktx currently in production which hasnt been named yet based on hemu top speed of 320km should be out around 2025

hemu was definitely something to be hyped for to bad there isnt a track in korea that could support 421km per hour"
daejeon,"there are no trains that connect jeonju to busan directly

by train youll have to first go to dajun or osong and transfer to trains that go to busan

alternatvely you can use the intercity bus from jeonju to busan busan is a big city with about 5 bus terminals some of which are located in outskirts of the city if youre taking the bus make sure your destination bus terminal puts you close the where you want to go in busan

taking the intercity bus is cheaper and faster unless youre using railpass"
daejeon,"holidays dont really cause decreased amount of trains in fact theres a possibility that there will be even more trains planned to upkeep with the demand however if it is long distance trip or if it is a holiday with a very high demand for trainslunar new year chuseok tickets may be sold out for this reason i recommend booking your trains between one month1week before the trip

seouljeonju is connected by ktx i would also check the timetable for yongsanjeonju as some ktx depart from yongsan and yongsan is right next to seoul station

for jeonjubusan no direct train routes are available youll have to transit at osong if you want to use trainsktx unless you plan on using railpass intercity bus between two cities are better busan has 5 intercity bus terminals so check the destination bus terminal if it gets you close to where you want to go

busanseoul is connected by gyeongbu highspeed railway with ktx and srt timetables filled with them keep in mind srt doesnt take railpass"
daejeon,"99 of time you could get your hands on standing tickets they are only sold on station though but if it is seoulbusan youll spend a lot time standing

economy seats for long distance trips could be sold out by that time it might not but i wouldnt risk that get your tickets at least one week before departure to get a seating ticket"
daejeon,"3d authentication is commonly asked question on this sub however noone figured out how to solve it yet it happens completely randomly and card companies says the card is fine

the card in question works fine in korea it only happens on online purchase try with yet another  card for online payment

as far as i know it is up to one month before train departure korail homepage says so"
daejeon,"i seen lots of people shittalk rail ninja anyway official site is httpswwwletskorailcom

language selection is on top right

or you can use the offical app korailtalk both of them support english

time it takes to board a train depends on how fast you can find that train theres no check in make sure youre on the right train if youre on the app it tells you which platform it is 15 minutes before departure or you can look at screen on station theres a lot of trains leaving for similar station at similar time so make sure

they dont even check your tickets as long as youre in the correct seat"
daejeon,"i tested it out after seeing your comment you are unable to choose your seats even in first class and when you try to purchase multiple tickets using computer it says to call korail to purchase tickets

however booking tickets using the korail appkorailtalk gave me better results while i was only able to choose whether i want to go with economy or first class it seems that the system tries to book seats next to each other when you tried to purchase tickets as a group and it led me to checkout page immediately while you are unable to choose which first class seats youll take you are still able to sit together

editing my post based on this"
daejeon,"ah they mustve changed it

technically seoul station is open 24hours but some parts of it close when there are no trains

i found that they start operating again at 4 and the fast food place inside seoul station opens at 4 as well

so anytime after 4am should be fine"
daejeon,having the same question about the standing tickets myself
daejeon,"im gonna go with no they dont check for peoples age unless they clearly see an adult sitting with a child ticket

however the reason why your child isnt allowed to get railpass is because children under 6 ride free but i dont know how seat reservations work for them i think you have to ask korail directly if you can they got their number on the railpass purchase site"
daejeon,"tickets are available on one month before departure up until train leaves the station

for example trains leaving on october 15th will sell their tickets starting on september 15th you can buy tickets for that train as long as its not sold out"
daejeon,"the only pass available to foreigners is the railpass otherwise i havent heard of any other deals these passes save you a ton of cost if youre planning to make frequent trips by trains

compared to trains in other countries koreas trains are on the cheaper side even high speed ones you should be okay"
daejeon,"it is easier to take the intercity bus between pohangbusan because trains require transfer and dongdaegueast daegu station or singyeongju however theres a mugunghwa that runs between pohang station and bujeonone of busans stations that doesnt need a transfer but this one leaves at 555 am from pohang

for seoulpohang ktx from seoul to pohang runs frequently without transfer srt which departs from suseo only has twice a day"
daejeon,"standing tickets are limited but it is super rare to see them getting filled up

the article you saw is mentioning about extension tickets done in similar fashion to what i wrote on how to get srt standing tickets its doable you buy the standing tickets and ask the conductor if there is any portion you can be seated then you pay for the seating ticket if theres an empty seat

youll have to purchase standing tickets at the station but keep checking the websiteapp because last minute cancellation are really common if you see a spot take it if nothing comes up purchase your standing ticketseoulbusan and ask the conductor if you can purchase a seat at least the partial of the way"
daejeon,i see does the outside of each train car have the car number labeled
daejeon,thanks ill get there early and try for a backfront seat 
daejeon,awesome thank you so much
daejeon,"i just saw ktxs newest trainsets are all emus really nice i prefer that style over the french push pull style 

i think brightline and cahsr are going to prove the dedicated passenger rail concept in us but god only knows if they can get some sort of dedicated tracks for the nec in america itd be really nice if they could but i suspect even with private dedicated rail the nec will still be shared with the freight companies and still not be fully electrified"
daejeon,"hi thanks for clarifying  

password  i understand now i thought i need to have an account to have the password to be entered

phone number  i did not proceed yet as it is not yet a month from my travel date only mocked book on a same day and stopped at passenger information however i was referring to phone number being asked when making an account which i thought is needed to have a password 

all clarified for now might come back if i encounter something
thank you again"
daejeon,"i think youve accidently replied to automod
anyway trains after dec 28 including 28th isnt appearing because theyre apparently going through rescheduling they say the booking will be open at a later date which is odd because korail usually tells when it will be open when they make such announcements my reccomendation is to check once a day if it has opened or not

youll be likely to get a standing ticket in case the seating is full they can be purchased on the ticket booth but you can buy standing tickets in advance as well"
daejeon,thank you for this insight 
daejeon,thank you this was very helpful
daejeon,"thanks for the reply op ive read a few different threads across different subs lots of people trying to buy from online retailers tickets figurines makeup etc on how to get pass the 3d secure but yes it seems pretty hopeless at this point 

ill buy my train tickets when i am in korea im just worried that the tickets will be sold out since it will be a heavier travel time bts and black pink concerts are happening does korail add additional trains  schedules to manage anticipated influx of travelers or should i expect the tickets to sell out if i dont secure them a month ahead thanks op"
daejeon,"thanks very much for helping me look further into this is the app in korean and once youve booked on the app does it show you your seats i dont know if its worth booking first class if we cant even choose our seats

i guess either i risk getting poor seats by booking ahead of time or i try to book them once in seoul about a week before and then it sounds like we could choose seats together"
daejeon,awesome thank you i have looked everywhere to find that info and its been nowhere i can find in english anyway
daejeon,thanks for your invaluable input
daejeon,thank you for your reply
daejeon,yup if not sure ask the conductors at the platform
daejeon,although i do believe it is safe to storage larger luggage ob the train right
daejeon,oh my mistake thank you for your notification and information is there any chance the standing tickets will be sold out too  i need to get from busan to seoul on new years eve as ive already booked a hotel room on that day now a bit afraid not be able to catch a train to seoul can i buy the standing tickets on the same website too is it under the same process as reserving a seat on the train
daejeon,cant really say for sure heard busan was looking into getting more transportation to the city dont know they actually did or not if they sell out youll have to use mix between seating and standing tickets
daejeon,"you are able to switch language to english on the app it shows you the seat number just before the checkout you could look at the ktx seat map like this

httpskorearailwaycomeca28cec849debb0b0ecb998eb8f84ktxec82b0ecb29caed8380ec9e85httpskorearailwaycomeca28cec849debb0b0ecb998eb8f84ktxec82b0ecb29caed8380ec9e85

to find which seat it is checked the app again and it tries to make group sit together in economy as well"
daejeon,do you also know which entrance of seoul station is the best for finding the ktx train im not sure where to tell my taxi driver to drop me off
daejeon,yeah its really rare to see something get stolen especially when it clearly belongs to someone btw you can book ahead on letskorail and guarantee yourself a front and back seati recommend back
daejeon,"standing tickets are sold when sitting tickets are sold out and has 1020 of the ktxs seating capacity 1020 are a lot when it comes to 9 cars18 if theyre running multi trains and if one train is sold out there are plenty of other trains in the incredible instance all ktx trains are out of standing tickets itx40 mugunghwa100 have much larger standing ticket capacity i wouldnt worry about it

theyre only sold on stationmost of the time and has no designated seat on the ticket there are two seats between coach cars and these are intended for standing tickets whoever sits there first takes it

since standing tickets dont show up in the conductors ticket system theyll ask you to present your ticket after every stop so if you get a standing ticket make sure to have your ticket readily available"
daejeon,thanks so much as long as i can see the seats before checkout then i know if theyre together and if not i wont buy ill check it out and update here  thank you
daejeon,sorry another question does the train number matter is first class in some better than others thanks
daejeon,honestly taxi drivers will know better than me just say seoul station and theyll land you in a reasonable spot
daejeon,"i booked ahead but didnt see where to choose my seat i must have missed it but thats ok  
youre being an amazing help so sorry to bother you again but i have one more question im thinking of arrived at least 30 minutes before the departure time should i arrive even earlier or even 30 minutes is too much"
daejeon,oh thank you so much for such a complete piece of information im new to ktx reservation system and all kinds of things relating to korea  now i can plan and know what my plan or even plan b are your post and replies have helped us a lot 
daejeon,sorry i have one more question for you to help on i might need to book a seat on srt trains for busan to singyeongju i wont buy the korail pass this time so i guess i dont need to limit my choice only for ktx  could you please guide me the official website for booking seat on srt trains  ive heard that some are of agencies and they do charge a lot extra thank you for your help
daejeon,it could mean differnce between orignal ktx and ktx sancheon however first class has same standard accross ktx so if you plan to ride on first class theres no difference in economy seats however ktx sancheon is recently builtcompared to orignal ktx so it has slightly better seats in economy however ive heard people describe ktx economy as slightly tight but not uncomfortableeven on the orignal
daejeon,"oh no i forgot english website doesnt support seat selection your ticket should have randomly assigned seat on it the front and back seats sell out pretty quick but you should be able to squeeze a luggage behind a very back seat i also heard some of the newer models of mugunghwa do have luggage space between cars but this is hit or miss you never know which type of car is your seat on

  
you could arrive 5 minutes before obviously dont recommend because cutting it close is never great and still get on general rule is 15 minutes theres no checkin procedure or anything find your platform double check youre on correct platform get on when train arrives they dont even check your tickets unless youre in a wrong seat"
daejeon,"httpsetksrailkrmaindolanguageenhttpsetksrailkrmaindolanguageen

this is the official site for srt tickets in english"
daejeon,darn it was working perfectly and put us in seats right next to each other in first class and then when i put in all my payment info to process i got an error code  do think this is to do with the credit card i could try again with a different one but just want to make sure it didnt charge me somehow already
daejeon,thank you so much 
daejeon,thank you so much for your informative post  amazing  i love trains as well my grandfather designed them  planning a rail journey from seoul to busan central and then busan central to incheon next month  your op was from 2 years ago  any strong recommendation on ktx vs srt to central busan station  does it matter most where in seoul you leave from  and can i take both from busan central to incheon  would be a family of four in first class  thank you again op
daejeon,thanks a lot
daejeon,it you dont receive confirmation email or something similar its highly unlikely that the payment has gone through try with a different card
daejeon,"hi again unless youre specifically going for the new model of ktx that started to operate earlier this month ktx and srt are the same it just matters where in seoul youre leaving from  if youre using railpass since srt doesnt have one

while high speed rails to incheon is under construction theyre nowhere near completion youll have to get off at gwangmyeong or seoul station to get to incheon"
daejeon,update had to try with 4 different cards banks and finally it went through success thanks for your help i was able to see the seats and everything 
daejeon,good to know thanks so there is no train that goes from busan to incheon without switching trains    obv easier to stay on the same train with luggage etc   wonder if that switching is enough of a hassle to just get off the train at seoul station and take a taxi 
daejeon,glad it worked out in the end have a great time at the concert
daejeon,can someone enlighten me about daegu andor daejeon
daejeon,"both are nice cities but i recommend going to gyeongju or jeonju instead if this is your first time in korea both are historic cities with many important cultural heritages daejeon and daegu grew as a transportation hub during the early 20th century after the construction of the train

daejeon became a technologyresearch hub during 70s and 80s thats why national science museum is famous there another famous attraction is sungsimdang a large bakery that only sells in daejeon it is so famous and successful that tourists from other cities come to daejeon just because of the bread 

daegu is famous for its central downtown named dongseongro i went there once and it was so energetic and vibrant comparable to the streets in seoul also daegu is where the founder of samsung started his company so theres an interesting park at their initial factory site"
daejeon,as someone thats lived in daegu for close to a decade now i personally recommend it lots of fun things to do
daejeon,daejeon seongsimdang is famous
daejeon,"the people who live in daejeon selfmock daejeon has no funny thing but have sungsimdang bakery 
actually i cant say daejeon has its own food or goto  place but if you visit there you can go some cafes and famous restaurant and you can feel sk not as tourist attraction but as residential area"
daejeon,i am with others who have suggested gyeongju very cool historical city check out bulguska temple seokgurum grotto donggung palace and wolji pond and the tombs just a lot to see and learn about here i was there a couple weeks ago again and i have always enjoyed the area
daejeon,imho both are livable fine downs but nothing terrible exciting for travelers i used to live in daejeon and was like hmmm lets go somewhere else when someone visited me theres at least 5 cooler towns than either off the top of my head gwangju jeonju kongju andong gangneung sokcho suncheon yeosu jeju seogwipo
daejeon,highly recommend you spend 2 nights in andong 
daejeon,i did a quick day trip from seoul to daejeon during my trip  agree theres not necessarily any sites to see but i did find quite a few cute cafes and it was interesting to see a different city i wish i had a little more time to wonder along the river etc i also think its a university town which is kind of fun if you do have some extra time in your itinerary it could be fun to just visit for a day for a different experience
daejeon,"hey friend how was andong we will leave gyeongju tomorrow for the jinju lantern festival but still have a couple of unassigned days before getting back 

for reference we really enjoyed seoul and busan and getting a feel of the tourist  not so touristic in busan districts and actually watching the locals go about their business and their norabang 

gyeongju is a very nice place for a stroll and soaking up the landscape but we definitely dont want to visit any more temples recreations i think weve got that completely checked down by now back home ive got a roman lighthouse from the ii century in my hometown neighborhood and 5 gothic cathedrals in a 200 mile radius so o think our monumental references are expectations are a bit different 
no disrespect at all we think wed rather enjoy better mingling around with people and earring the delicious food please give us more food destinations"
daejeon,"skip them and go somewhere like gyeongju andong or east coast cities like gangneung or sokcho 

daegu and daejeon wont feel one bit different from any other seoul city neighborhood overall"
daejeon,any massage in daegu that has extra service
daejeon,daegu also known as gotham is considered the most bacward politicallyincorrect hicktown amongst the locals daejeon while known as a boring city to visit is quite charming and slowpaced
daejeon,does the bakery have a location at the train station in daejeon was there recently for a wedding and almost every single person had the same bag looked like from a bakery
daejeon,ah yeah thank you maybe ill hit up daegu for a short time after seoul go onto gyeongju and then finish up in busan appreciate the insight 
daejeon,good to know and glad to hear leaning towards leaving out daejeon and visiting daegu before going on to gyeongju 
daejeon,hey man i arrive in daegu later today got any recommendations
daejeon,ooo looks great
daejeon,thanks for that i do enjoy visiting places without much to do exactly and just soaking up the local life so maybe it would suit me nicely 
daejeon,cheers think its definitely gonna slide into the itinerary based on what ive heard
daejeon,weve actually just snuck andong into our itinerary for a few nights so im glad to hear you got any specific recommendations for when there by chance
daejeon,"seoga sundubu  soft tofu stew

andong jjang dumplings  loved this dumpling spot their set meals were great value and some of the best dumplings we had in korea

mammoth bakery  very popular bakery spot famous for their cream cheese bread thought it was just okay but got lots of other nice bits 

andong brewing publichouse  im big on my craft beer and they had lots of their own brews and others from across south korea also had a nonalcoholic craft beer had a pizza here too which was decent but nothing crazy

midrange  never got in here but popular cafe and desserts in an old hanok

enjoyed andong a fair bit parts of the town are a bit uninspiring but there are some very nice pockets i would still recommend going to the hahoe folk village as its not got the same vibe as visiting templesmuseums etc and its an interesting and quaint little place can get there on the bus very easily"
daejeon,"this

also gangneung  great hiking"
daejeon,yes they do it is really tasty and good for value so many train riders visit their store
daejeon,if possible i recommend to rent a car lots of places that are absolutely stunning and getting there would make it a whole lot easier to get to with a car
daejeon,what do you like to do
daejeon,it tastes good but the price is really reasonable
daejeon,"oh right daejeon has government complex daejeon so if you go restaurant around it to eat dinner many of people just finished work and drink soju for exmaple 
it might be speical experience"
daejeon,thanks a lot my girlfriend really wants to try jjang
daejeon,not possible unfortunately
daejeon,enjoy galleries museums any cafe or restaurant recommendations would be greatly appreciated too
daejeon,if youre american and not already in south korea you can walk in and out of aaa with a international drivers permit in 30 minutes id recommend it if its an option
daejeon,"busy day sorry for the late response 

if you go to banwoldang station  

then go to the south end of it exit 9 and take the first right
pretty cafes in that area with some art galleries 
my favorite is deep coffee roasters 

there is my favorite cafe in all of daegu called  
it is more on the expensive side and a bit far but no regrets going there its a coffee wine bar and they built it themselves personally know the owner and theyre great and very knowledgeable about what they sell 

i also recommend 
shares great history about daegu 

 is also a greaat little place in the evening to go to and rest at the mart in the middle of the park and have a drink if youre into that  

famous dumpling places i recommend it  directly in downtown

if you go down the road of 2 13 theres a bunch of good  restaurants to go too across the street from the fire department 


i quickly just wrote it up but if youre looking for anything else lmk"
daejeon,neither of us can drive 
daejeon,than you very much mate ill make good use of the recommendations 
daejeon,oh well thats definitely a no go then hope you have fun
daejeon,thanks now weve started getting a plan together we cant wait
daejeon,solo trip in korea

near seoul  suwon is nice place

 suwon hwaseong fortress you can experience archery at the east gate at night you can enjoy the view by riding a helium hot air balloon 

if you walk along the castle walls from the east gate to the north gate you will come across a pavilion called banghwa suryujeong

there is a small pond in front of the pavilion so it is a good place to spread out a mat and have a picnic 

around  haenggungdong there are many small and pretty cafes and restaurants they are all instagramfriendly and have recently become more famous as a filming location for dramas ex lovely runner  

you can climb to the top of paldaesan mountain or go to paldamunsouth gate market eat chicken in the chicken alley and look around the traditional market 

even if its not around hwaseong fortress the shopping mall called starfield suwon is also nice to see the nearby  seoho lake park has a very artistic sunset view


after or before touring suwon you can go to everland amusement park and korean folk village in yongin"
daejeon,how about visiting  gangneung its a beautiful coastal city located in gangwon province and its definitely worth a visit
daejeon,i travelled solo recently as well  i enjoyed my stay in jeonju stayed in the hanok village and just relaxed walking around
daejeon,please dont add daejeon to your itinerary unless you would like to see a bridge and a bakerytry yeosu

daejeon,"oooh yes i was considering suwon as well i saw a tiktok on the starfield library and it was sooooo stunning

thank you so much for the recommendations"
daejeon,ooh i do want too it is where this drama she was pretty filmed some scenes i think how do you find the public transport there i visited pohang and was terrified by the bus  frequencies there leaving me stranded at some times 
daejeon,ahh thats another place i was considering and foresee myself pretty much just staying and chilling in the accoms how is the public transportation there
daejeon,"i will keep this in mind when i travel to korea next

but it seems like bus drivers do have scheduled breaks from time to time just that the driver i met in pohang couldnt explain it to me due to language barriers a driver in busan did explain to me in whatever english he could manage thank you though "
daejeon,"well library itself is just a library and if its only the reason of visiting starfield maybe little bit disappointed but overall mall is nice because it has everything such as rooftop dogs playground little garden restaurants floor movie theater kids room gym swimming pool clothing shops bookstore basement martlike costco all in one building 

anyway nice place for shopping  

personally buying packed fried or marinated chicken and sushi at basement traders mart and bring it with mat then having picnic lunch or dinner chilling with friends or even myself at seoho lake park or nearby park is better than eating at restaurant in starfirld

httpsyoutubef5jnhpoizg0sisgmh9v38jgumlqx

httpsyoutubetbaadu2chgksizhfcuxvq0ohw2g0z

and also starfield and nearby parks are one of the places where can see the most cute doggos around 

suwon is pet friendly city in general "
daejeon,if you are traveling from seoul taking a ktx train is the best option in gangneung youll mostly need to rely on buses the public transportation there is probably better than in pohang but it could still be a bit challenging
daejeon,transporation is quite good  i mostly took the bus but most of the time i spend walking around the hanok village
daejeon,"ofc hahaha thanks for sharing my travels in korea has been on the cheaper side so far as i rarely go to restaurants mainly because i am travelling alone 

have you been to other cities in korea if so what other places do you recommend"
daejeon,"if you want to get around without paying expensive train fares or using a car the cheapest option is to take the subway near the seoul gyeonggido or to chungcheongdo or gangwondo where the subway reaches


let me list them just for now thinking suwon yongin ansan multicultural city incheon beach tidal mud flats chinatown hwaseongjebu island clam grill above sea cable car yacht experience etc even chuncheon in gangwondo is good

when planning a budget trip it is a good to look at the kakao subway app

if transportation is not an issue boseong green tea fields jirisan mountain seoraksan mountain and other areas with nature come to mind but it will probably take times and money to get there"
daejeon,10day korea itinerary
daejeon,"for the 5th day in seoul if youre fit and into hiking try the hike up bukhansan mountain

httpswwwkomootcomdedetour1532546419sharetokenacihqjesohhuehfiu848h1ylacfrviq9wojh4yfquq9oragrtzrefwtd

beautiful scenery i recommend the easy path tho if you are not fit"
daejeon,"there is a sunsimdang at daejeon station and the original store is a walking distance away aswell you do not need to take the subway  

however as other people said if you are going to daejeon just for bread you are gonna be really bored while it is good there is similar bread in other cities too"
daejeon,is this itinerary feasible also can you recommend something we can do on our 5th day we still have dsp by that time is nami island worth the entire day also is 2 hrs enough time to arrive at the airport before arrival
daejeon,deleted
daejeon,as someone whose husband gets free sungsimdang bread every few months or so from his companyits definitely not worth the trip there just to try it
daejeon,are there any other good hikes id be keen on 3 or 4 during my time there
daejeon,nami island is a theme park whether its worth it to you is based on your preference see youtube videos on it to get a better idea
daejeon,eat some ramen at banpo hangang park shop for souvenirs at daiso at myeongdong or hongdae visit trendy seoul at seongsu half day trip to dmz
daejeon,for my past travels i usually do half day nami island then you may couple it with garden of morning calm or petite france
daejeon,i second this daejeon is famous for being a boring city so i would say skip it and stay longer in busan
daejeon,have read many saying daejeon is boring but i have already booked a place before i read these hahaha planning to go to jangtaesan park
daejeon,unfortunately wed only been on baegundae peak but i heard dobongsan peak is also stunning definitely on my list when i visit again
daejeon,mt seoraksan incredible and worth the drive
daejeon,must have korean food thats not in los angeles
daejeon,street hotteok
daejeon,"maybe abalone i feel like thats much rarer and super expensive in the us most seafood in general tbh

oh also eating oysters with chojang i know there are oysters here too but i never want cocktail sauce"
daejeon,hanwoo beef impossible to get outside of korea
daejeon,"unagi bbq

katsu with cheese technically japanese but i havent found any similar offerings in ca

barley bibimbap"
daejeon,its been 40 years since ive been in korea and ive been here for a month and a half theres really nothing here thats super unique that we cant get back home maybe the live baby octopus the only thing different is the blue crabs here are humongous compared to the size in the states food also doesnt taste better here than the korean food back in the states plus sometimes the street food doesnt taste fresh because its been cooked and sitting there
daejeon,"really i have been searching high and low for korean katsu such as this jeongdon

httpswwwmangoplatecomrestaurantswuk02yqci9h

can you recommend a few"
daejeon,bbq chicken here is night and day compared to the states
daejeon,the street hotteok you cant get anywhere and they are slightly  different in each place my fave was busan and the bungeoppang is also slightly different in each city and nothing like we have here in ktown in aus
daejeon,"seoul
highly recommend oreno ramen main store
 and man jok oh hyang jokbal

feel like theres no good jokbal in the states  oreno ramen is a chicken based ramen that i have not seen in the states either"
daejeon,soy sauce marinated raw crab crab is larger fresher and cheaper in korea
daejeon,street food really is the thing but some of the cakes  breads in the coffee shops mightve different too im surrounded by lorean cafes and restaurants and ive never eaten anything like the walnut  cream cheese and walnut bread  cake that i could only get in one bakery in gangnam
daejeon,ive never found good  or  in la my favorite chicken dishes in korea my favorite  spot is a popular one near hoegi station in seoul
daejeon,"sweet chilly crispy boneless    at oppadak

my personal favorite"
daejeon,i mean food in la is just a bit expensive but pretty much the same
daejeon,pyungyang naengmyun     cold noodle    not the sweet and sour high msg ones you find at restaurants that sell everything   the traditional cold noodle dish thats made with clear beefy broth that hasnt been seasoned with a lot of spices sold at restaurants that specialize in cold noodles   it doesnt exist in nyc and it doesnt exist in la   practically only in korea
daejeon,jjokbal
daejeon,thanks everyone for the great suggestions ill definitely try to look out for some of these once im out there  on another note does anyone know where i can get some good duck bbq in daejeon jeonju busan or gyeongju  my family loves duck but im having trouble finding a good place and ill just be with them in the cities outside of seoul
daejeon,psst  la korean food is better  the only thing you might get in korea that you cant get in la is fresh 
daejeon,perhaps the famous raw crabsshrimps
daejeon,"it would help if you listed what is available in la   
however im from la and live in seoul youre right its not even close"
daejeon,i found one place in la that does  style  but honestly cant think of much else
daejeon,i suggest you check out the foodie channels on youtube that feature korean food there are so many options available
daejeon,korean east coast has tasty raw fish mulhoe 
daejeon,white  forgot what city but its a place known for its 
daejeon,sujebi  you can get it in la i grew up there but i just had it in seoul at samcheongdo sujebi and it rocked me to my core so good
daejeon,pyongyang naengmyeon might seem bland but it has such a pure taste we had it at woo lae oak dont think its related to the one in la but cant remember
daejeon,"thankyou chicken in gjeonju was there last week and it was incredible kfc literally everywhere in seoul is great jeonju most food options are near the hanok village busan go the main fish market for sea food but also reall good bbq and other options in seomyeon  


edit i know you said food you cant really get at home im from la too but these are just some very general notes for authentic korean food you cant get here definitely fish market in busan seafood stew or octopus"
daejeon,id recommend kind of street food like hottek tanfulu or something like that i dont know how many or how various kinds of korean food are there but i guess korean restaurants there are so expensive very cheap food like  korean street food rarely would be accepted in uss foreign food markets what do you think
daejeon,taejongdae yolo fish grill in busan
daejeon,just try everything you can eat a lot of the same things in la but theyre nowhere near the same quality as they are here the korean food in la doesnt even compare here in korea they have beef tacos but their no where close to what a carne asada taco in ca would taste like
daejeon,honestly visiting korean  local markets is an experience that la cant offer just because there are things in la doesnt mean itll taste the same in korea walk around and explore and see what eateries youll bump into 
daejeon,"i tried this chicken stew dish and it was stellar they allow solo diners so that isnt a problem it may be a lot for a solo diner but you can easily take it to go this was in seoul worth trying out

httpsseoulshoppercomblogsrestaurantspoongnyeondakdoritang"
daejeon, in busan
daejeon,i highly recommand to watch korean youtube ddoganjinrestaurants youve gone more than twice which introduces the best delicious resturants in each region that you will travel im gonna leave the link herehttpsyoutubecomplaylistlistpl8zmfxf9ts5yzyrlnag51mqkurwybbk5sipcn496poqnhfs4no it hunts the real one which even each region natives dont know it will help you to find musteat places
daejeon,as far as i know gyeongju bread is very famous in korea and you cant find it in la i recommend that you try to gyeongju bread  when youre in gyeongju
daejeon,"not a suggestion but a somewhat related question is it worth trying  myeongdong kyoja when visiting korea when they have their own branch in la mdk noodles 

ive been to the mdk noodles in ktown and personally thought it was good but not worth waiting for a potentially long time and now that im planning a trip to sk ive always wondered if there was any difference between the la mdk noodles branch and the actual myeongdong kyoja in seoul and if there is a difference then is it significant enough that myeongdong kyoja should actually be a stop during our time in seoul"
daejeon,a lot of people are saying its no different but thats a lie haha la korean food is really good tho seoul has so many districts that its hard to tell you exactly where to go dont go to the overly hyped places on social media theyre usually disappointing i know this is super random  not korean  but if you like honey  go to starbucks and get a honey grapefruit ice tea its sooo good cant get it here seafood is also really fresh in busan
daejeon,when youre trying to move with express bus try  foods
daejeon,"as a korean who has been living in the the states for the past 15 years these are my top 3 places not in order that i liked during my most recent visit to seoul   
traditional korean top 3  
 seongbukdong nurungji baeksuk    
 jinmi pyeongyang naengmyeon   
 jinju kitchen hamo

korean fine dining  top 3

street foodamerican food top 3  
 pyungangsoe tteokbbok   
 pungnyeon ssal nongsan   
 jackson pizza "
daejeon,1 this blew my mind the most
daejeon,good call  outside of fish and octopus im not the biggest fan of seafood but i do love jeonbokjuk so maybe ill look out for that
daejeon,"this dont be scared by the workers carrying giant hunks of flaming charcoal it enhances the meat flavor and seriously is another level from the common grills seen in the states

if you like chinese korean fusion find a good lamb skewer place run by a chinesekorean and go nuts also order gwabarou a less sweet and more chewy version of sweet and sour pork im obsessed with lamb skewers places"
daejeon,katsu with cheese is pretty common in socal in la  oc
daejeon,i love the pungcheon eel bbq in seoul best meal of the trip for us
daejeon,crabs for sure  korean crabs are very different and the texture and fragrance is different from the states
daejeon,korean food is just as good in ktown you do know smoking crack is heavily penalized here right
daejeon,is korean katsu very different from japanese katsu  there are few korean katsu owned places in la like wako but im not sure if its like katsu in korea
daejeon,lol you can find this in la
daejeon,theres been more than one korean american chef whos said korean food in ktown is just as good or better than what you find in seoul the korean population in la is the biggest outside of korea after all but its totally subjective of course and that person is probably used to the korean food you get in la
daejeon,"i respectfully disagree    
a few years back i was home for my birthday and wanted kamjatang i read a bunch of reviews and ended up going to what was rated the best in la compared to korea kamjatang basically any run of the mill spot is way way better not to mention my favorite spot   
a few years before that the same scenario played out but for jjim dalk again it was good if youve never been to andong i went to andong last week and again way way better   
most recently it was dalk galbi and kimbap its kimbap cheongguk quality at best sure sure if you pay like 2025 a roll you get comparisons to a 3 dollar one in seoul but are we comparing the same things at that point"
daejeon,can you recommend me your fave spot for kamjatang or any good ones in seoul
daejeon,considering i havent even been to korea yet much less not exactly a connoisseur of korean food im certainly not going to argue with you on this i was just saying what ive heard some people say but like i said everyone has their own opinions
daejeon,yup   kamjaguk is imho identical to kamjatang
daejeon,ah but i mean where is your favorite spot 
daejeon," 

 this is literally the name of the restaurant it is on line 4 sungshin womens uni"
daejeon,ah okie thanks so much 
daejeon,itinerary shakedown  2 weeks first time in south korea
daejeon,hiking in bukhansan mountain one day would be nice
daejeon,daejeon is infamous for having nothing to do id recommend daegu but it can be quite hot around this time
daejeon,"sokcho intercity bus terminal do operate bus ride between sokcho and busan  do you mind if i ask you if there is specific reason why you would go back to seoul and then take train to busan

add x the sky busan and haedong yonggungsa temple on your busan travel schedule its located in haeundae so you will find easy to reach

suggestion something like haedong yonggungsa temple  blue line beach train station songjungtake train  blue line beach train station mipoget off train  x the sky busan sounds reasonable route"
daejeon,"i think you should cut down on seoul and busan since they are just big cities and add gyeongju which is pretty close to busan

we are still in korea and our plan looks like this we love hiking and not so keen on big cities so far our plan

 3 days in seoul there are no art galleries which is weird we love art galleries museums were also okayish but have beautiful architecture we went for some shopping but we are not big shoppers

 2 days in seoraksan you can do all 3 main one day trails in one day if you are fit enough it was really beautiful and the trails well maintained prepare to climb some stairs a lot

 3 days in gyeongju the bus from seoul is cheaper than train to busan and gyeongju is just one hour bus ride from busan very lovely small city with lots of traditional architecture we also took a public bus to gyeongju national park for a hike much less demanding than seoraksan because much lower peak the trails can be a bit slippery when going down i landed on my ass twice but i didnt bring my hiking shoes i think its off season here because so many places weve been to were empty

our future plan is
2 days in busan again we are not very keen on big cities i did some research and other than busan museum of art and gamcheon culture village nothing else caught my eye

5 days in jeju  seogwipo we want to chill on the beach a bit and then do a hardcore hike hallasan national park weve read that it takes about 8 hours to complete then we rest again and fly back to seoul for a night

most of the intercity buses can be bought in advance on klook minus one from gyeongju to busan which we bought at the machine when we arrived our transportation looks like this

seoul  sokcho by bus
sokcho  seoul  gyeongju by bus
gyeongju  busan by bus
busan  jeju by plane
jeju  seoul by plane

we have yet to take a taxi because you can buy a public transport card and top it up naver local navigation did not disappoint us so far you can almost get anywhere with public transport"
daejeon,thanks it looks really nice
daejeon,thanks for the tip about daejeon do you mean daegu is hot now or are you saying it will be hot in midoctober when i would potentially go there
daejeon,"awesome suggestions thank you

ok i thought the sokcho to seoul to busan route didnt make sense as well but i saw several articles which were then reinforced by chat gpt that the easiest and fastest route is to go back through seoul thanks for pointing this out ill try to map out a more direct route"
daejeon,thanks for sharing your itinerary ill check out things to do in gyeongju maybe as a day trip from busan that was one thing i forgot to mention in my original post we really like doing at least one day trip if we are in a city for 4 days to get a chance to see more of the country
daejeon,deleted
daejeon,it would definately chill down in mid october
daejeon,"reserve ticket from here

httpstxbusetmoneycokrotcktrmlinfentydohttpstxbusetmoneycokrotcktrmlinfentydo"
daejeon,"i didnt mean it doesnt have any it has a lot but they are small and mostly privately owned i am used to big art galleries owned or semi owned by government for example the national gallery in london or the louvre

we went to sema national museum of modern and contemporary art and dongdaemun design plaza and there was not much to see tbh maybe we had bad luck because it seemed like half of the exhibitions were closed

if you have better recommendations please share because we will be back to seoul for a day"
daejeon,got it is there any reason you recommend daegu
daejeon,thank you
daejeon,is this a 3rd party site or something official for the tmoney card
daejeon,"this site is super confusing is one of these options a tmoney card or can i actually use my nonkorean credit card

httpsimgurcomakmq4chphttpsimgurcomakmq4chp



and what would a tourist put in the resident registration number field or is it optional"
daejeon,daejeon to incheon airport
daejeon,buses run from daejeon to the airport at 2030min intervals all day its actually one of the most popular routes in the country does it not show up on your end from daejeon terminal to the airport takes around three hours
daejeon,"you can do ktx if you have the strength for it people store thier bags in the area between cars i forget if only particular cars have baggage or not  but get the ones that do only have baggage storage if thats the casw even when they get full you can just leave it there to the side

ive seen one person do 4 checked luggage which imo is absurd and they looked like they hated life but ive seen it ive also done 2 checked luggage plus bag and personally for me thats no problem but going over 2 2 hands would be tough

your solace is in korea odds are extremely low that people will see an unintended checked bag and run off with it so in the car compartment as well as if you need to take some time unloadingloading onto the train or if the elevator on your platform isnt working and you need to take a couple trips via escalator you can do that with peace of mind

problem with daejeon to seoul is you may be getting on a train that departed from busan which means baggage spots could be full but its a roll of the dice because people that day could also be getting off at earlier cities choose an early off time preferably and book early to get the baggage carriage car again cant remember if every section between cars has baggage carriage or not

from seoul station you can get the airport subway line those also have baggage storage and from seoul station you would be getting on at the departure station which means first dibs on seat and storage

dont have any better alternative suggestions but not sure how familiar with ktx you are so figured id mention the above"
daejeon,"use naver maps and enter the future time and date to see your options  youll want to arrive at the airport at least 2 12 to 3 hours early  intercity bus makes more stops and is less luxurious than express bus but the difference between the two can be indistinguishable pricewise and timewise depending on what two cities you are traveling between intercity buses are booked via txbus or bustago online express buses are booked via kobus see visit koreas express bus pagehttpsenglishvisitkoreaorkrsvccontentsinfobscviewdovcontsid140657 for the details

looks like though if you want to get to incheon airport by 930am three hours before your flight youll need to depart from daejeon station no later than 7am  best route is 1 hour and 45 minutes by ktx to gwangmyeon station and then take the 6004 or 6770 to incheon airport  naver map
  incheon international airport 1st passenger terminal transit directions 
httpsnaverme5l7vbmvy
 if you take intercity bus it will take 3 hours and 5 minutes and if you leave by 630am you will arrive at 935am
 if you take express bus it will take 3 hours and 1 minute and if you leave by 630am you will arrive at 931am  you will need to transfer at seoul bus terminal and board the 6020"
daejeon,"there are buses to icn from the main daejeon terminal complex  also calling at the government complex dunsan  a separate route to icn departs from yuseong  this line is calling at sejong city

so it depends on where in daejeon youre starting from expect a journey time of 3 hours on either route"
daejeon,yeah ive been looking at the kobus website but a route from daejeon terminal to the airport doesnt show up for me 0 is there another website that you would suggest using
daejeon,ahh the route is an intercity bus  not express bus  this means that you should be looking on the txbushttpsintercitybusetmoneycokr or bustagohttpswwwbustagoorkrnewwebenindexdo
daejeon,which places should i visit in korea
daejeon,ill recommend you jeonju where you can see traditional houses such as hanok gangneung its by the east sea and you can take a ktx from seoul which takes around 2 hours jeju busan and gyeongju but i wouldnt recommend daegu daejeon or gwangju as there isnt much special to see also if you like going for a hike i would recommend you seoraksan and hallasanjeju
daejeon,have you seen my maphttpskkotozzlu58iwjr
daejeon,yeonnam in seoul is a great neighborhood imo
daejeon,if you havent gotten a cycle get one you can get one second hand for less than 100000  there is so much hidden away here and there  most people dont realize how much goes on in the countryside  with the river parks you can cover a lot of ground for example you can bike all the way from bundang to inchon just using the river paths
daejeon,"definitely visit busan and gyeongju

its okay to skip daegu daejeon and gwangju they are just large cities

jeju island is a mustvisit

songdo is worth visiting but i wouldnt recommend nami island

visit seoraksan and gangneung together

id suggest suncheon over yeosu visit the suncheon bay wetlands both cities are famous for their food

consider a day trip to jeonju or combine yeosu suncheon and jeonju if you like korean food jeolla province including yeosu suncheon and jeonju is a mustvisit

andong is also worth visiting"
daejeon,jeonjuhttpsenglishvisitkoreaorkrsvccontentscontentsviewdomenusn602vcontsid182528 for the bibimbap and more
daejeon,if my friend comes to korea i will take them to busan and gyeongju
daejeon,lots of hiking trails
daejeon,cafe culture and next to hongdae
daejeon,no just the top thing is a hiking trail set its fairly diverse and across the entire country its palaces folk villages hidden beaches im an avid traveler and lived in korea 15 years this map is the culmination of my favorite places
daejeon,1 month trip to s korea what would you do
daejeon,if you have a lot of time definitely do jeju gyeongju for a night or two is good as well
daejeon,"jeju is a must its known for the black pork belly and hallabong oranges as well as the fresh seafood a lot of scenic places as seen from many kdramas cafes are pretty the roads along the ocean are perfect walking or biking ill be going again in april this time to see mt hallasan id recommend taking the kt to busan from seoul and then taking jeju air from busan to jeju best route if you are to go last year i went during hurricane season so busan and jeju were off the list i went to gangneung instead which is on the east side of seoul and also another hot vacation spot amongst koreans both are good options if you want to see the ocean 

ill also throw out japan most koreans also love going to japan since flights are cheap that is also a whole different country to explore if you have the time to go"
daejeon,"if its a day trip i would suggest incheon and suwon both places are really nice and if you havent been worth a visit 

if you like beaches i would recommended sokcho or gangneung gangneung is popular because of the bts bus stop and goblin filming location if it is something that interest you but my favourite is just enjoying the beach and the tofu village 

since you have been to busan why not try daegu or pohang a couple days at both places would be nice and you can also throw in a small busan trip to revisit it 

yeosu has a nice night market that as good food but 2 days 1 night would be enough 

of course jeju its a lovely place and great atmosphere you can do all the popular things i would suggest though you rent a car because it just makes your time there easier"
daejeon,     all recommended you can easily spend 5 days in  i would dedicate a day to hike 
daejeon,i would personally switch daejeon for gyeongju
daejeon,jeju is incredible do it
daejeon,jeju sokcho yeosu

httpsthereshegoesagainorgkoreaitineraryonemonth  
the blogger does a great job of hitting most of the top spots across the country while minimizing travel time in between might give you some good ideas on how to structure your trip jeju and gyeongju are both great suggestions to add like others have said"
daejeon,"march to april is such a nice season to visit korea
i would spend more time in jeollado yeosu suncheon boseong for grean tea farm rather than gyeongsang ulsan or pohang 

if you are into traditional korean culture i would also recommend gyeongju or jeonju hanok village 

as other ops said jeju is a must dont forget to eat black pig"
daejeon,get a plastic surgery
daejeon,hey there what itinerary you ended up with i am also planning to visit south korea in april the first time and was wondering what people do if they around a month to spend
daejeon,is gyeonju possible as a one day trip without spending the night there 
daejeon,thanks anything you especially think we shouldnt miss in jeju i will look at gyeongju for sure i will also look at jeonju which i forgot to mention in my original post
daejeon,thanks so much for this yep we would love to eat the black pork belly and the hallabong oranges so even that alone probably seals the deal i will look into gangneeung we have been to japan a few times tho not for about 10 years i was just thinking i wanted to have the time to be flexible with seeing the cherry blossoms and i wouldnt be pleased if i had booked say a week in japan probably i would need to be thinking about booking that around now and then i somehow missed the cherry blossoms in sk but then also managed to somehow miss them in japan too 
daejeon,"thanks for this yes i was definitely planning a day in suwon will check out incheon

i do like beaches but i will be strolling by the beach in busan quite a lot will need to find out what the tofu village is tho i would like to see that hand at pohang but think it could be a bit of a faff on public transport 

thanks for the yeosu tip will research yes the general consensus here seems to be definitely a trip to jeju but without a car it can be a bit time consuming so we will look into getting a car thanks again that really helped"
daejeon,thank you
daejeon,i so enjoyed sitting with my feet in that hot springs thing in daejeon and i had my first icy cold noodles experience there  will look into gyeongju any specific recs you can give me thanks
daejeon,thanks will do our best
daejeon,thanks
daejeon,thanks yes ulsan is on our list now any specific recs for there if you have the time
daejeon,thanks so much for this such a helpful link
daejeon,thanks for this yes jeju black pig and jeonju are on our list yours if the first mention of suncheon and boseong so i will look into that enjoyed green tea based trips in taiwan so thats something were interested in
daejeon,is jeju good in marchapril and without a car
daejeon,thanks for your reply i cant say thats on my list  but each to their own
daejeon,"its possible if youre not going to bulguksa or 
seokguram i still stayed one night last time though even though i didnt go to those two places i would stay the night so you could see wolji pond at night"
daejeon,"it is possible as a oneday trip if you plan your journey efficiently although you will have to forgo some attractionsplaces that are far from the main cluster

i walked from the gyeongju intercity bus terminal and through the main cluster of attractions and ended at the wolji pond at around sunset just prior to when the lights are illuminated after having time to take in the night lights i then took a city bus back to the intercity bus terminal"
daejeon,its been quite a few years since i went to jeju and othersother posts will probably have better  recommendations i did like the short hike at seongsan ilchulbong gotta get some pork bbq there as well as some seafood osulloc tea farm was kind of crowded when i went but i guess it was kind of cool
daejeon,black pork belly is overhyped youll find out once u try it lol
daejeon,i think all the spots you want to visit are fairly close and easy to reach walkable even one of the only relaxing cities in korea
daejeon,"you for sure have to check out 

daewangam park its a bit far from the main area of ulsan but you can take a bus its so beautiful and the ocean view is nice

if you like museums you can go to the whale museum and whale watching as ulsan is known for its whales  but i heard it has to be a specific time where you can catch a glimpse of the whales

taehwagang bamboo forrest is a nice place for walking having a picnicresting is a very calming place maybe if you want to wind down and have a relaxing walk 

if you like litvibrant places check out the area mugeodong its mostly students who hang out there as its close to the uni but its very lively and you can find nice food places and rec things like karaoke batting cages arcades 

ulsan grand park is another one its a huge park and many things to see and do if you go i think its around may you can see the flowers they have its a huge display its very beautiful 

theres many more but these are my top picks for people to check out

hope this helps"
daejeon,im a big fan of pork belly so i would definitely try it what does overhyped mean in this context not worth the extra spend over normal pork belly or not as tasty as anticipated
daejeon,it definitely does thanks my oh company has a deal with a hotel group and they have one in ulsan so that will work great for us for a few days there
daejeon,"its just a lil more ex than normal pork belly so definitely try it but yes cant really taste a difference 

if youre in seoul try ggupdang kbbq enjoyed that the most"
daejeon,"thanks for this yep regular pork belly is pretty tasty when its done well so i can imagine its fairly hard to beat  i will make a note of that kbbq place thanks actually i just looked it up and found this interesting article  httpsdanielfooddiarycom20230406ggupdang

and im thrilled to read that the staff will do the cooking as when we have been before its a constant battle to get my oh to wait until the meat is actually cooked"
daejeon,"most of the kbbq places do the cooking for you not to worry d 

can check out seongsan ilchulbong for nice views theres even an hour hike up the mountain if thats something youre into can check out haeilri cafe there too its overlooking the sea"
daejeon,seoraksan jangtaesan naejangsan or nami island for day trip to see fall foliage
daejeon,"httpsenglishvisitkoreaorkrsvccontentsinfohtmlviewdomenusn654vcontsid204449 has a list of popular places to see fall foliage

i would choose seoraksan if the forecasthttpsblogtrazycomkoreaautumnfoliageforecast is accurate as it will be the first place in south korea on october 21 to have peak foliage"
daejeon,if youre not interested in hiking  but want to see the foliage then of your choices id recommend nami island naejangsan has beautiful red maple leaves but its a steep hike and very crowded in octobernovember jangtaesan is over an hour away from jeonju so thats gonna be a lot if you plan on heading back to seoul the same day even if you take the ktx
daejeon,havent been to the others but ive been to nami fun little place rent a pension and eat dalk galbi
daejeon,agree with this you dont have to do hard hiking there if you dont want to peak color time will be busy lots of places

daejeon,best to be in jeju or busan in late october fall will be finished elsewhere in korea in the last week of october
daejeon,"i like your plan you can also do day trips out of seoul if you want to see other places too cant speak on sokcho or daejeon but daegu and many people including locals will agree with you is boring especially if youre already doing seoul and busan 100 keep jeju  i may be biased though because it was my fave part of my trip and has been on my bucket list for years 

by northern part of jeju you mean near jeju city consider changing that i went to jeju city during my trip and most of it reminded me of the city parts of busan the parts near the water dont matter because 1 you can access the water from pretty much anywhere in jeju except hallasan and 2 more of the scenic spots are not near or in jeju city going to jeju but predominantly only spending time innear jeju city is having not gone to jeju at all

my friend and i roadtripped the circumference of the island stopping at different points for the night but if you dont want to stay in the middle of nowhere in a random small town which i get then id suggest seogwipo in the south"
daejeon,"wed be renting a car and driving ourselves sorry i probably used a confusing choice of words

i think based on your advice and our usual travel preferences it sounds like seogwipo might actually be a better home base for us we are quiet people who live a slow life sounds like well get our fill of busy city life in seoul and busan ive also heard jeju is the korean hawaii so i guess its probably similar to staying along the north shore of oahu vs staying in honolulu

thanks so much for the advice"
daejeon,"my only question is why you would limit yourself on the northern part of jeju

like yes 4 days is short and you could have some rainy days but you could easily put in some destinations all over the island if you really want jeju is not that big

there is no point in staying near the airport imho unless you have like a very early flight and need to be there"
daejeon,"very good to know thank you

we had originally planned to arrive in seoul a week earlier in october but our travel plans changed unexpectedly its good to know well still catch some fall goodness in jeju and busan"
daejeon,"thank you this feedback is helpful

we are considering day trips out of seoul but it will all depend on how we get on with our energetic toddler

road tripping jeju and making several overnight stops along the way would have been a great way to do it if we werent traveling with a toddler we would do that but i think itll just be easier to settle in and return to one place if its only for 4 nights we live in regional town too so quite used to traveling a fair distance to get tofrom anywhere

the hotel were looking at is in oedodong to be honest we chose it because the hotel amenities price etc fit our preferencesneeds most of the sights and activities we are looking at are spread all over the island we planned on doing day trips hence the need for the hire car so we figured it probably didnt matter too much where we actually stayed given that extra info would you still recommend seogwipo over being near jeju city"
daejeon,we wouldnt i think there has been some confusion i meant we were looking at staying in a hotel on the northern part of the island we plan on renting a car and driving all around the island to different sightsactivities
daejeon,"they are incorrect my bday is oct 30 and i always know that i always miss the foliage in seoul bc i go to bangkok  and also its cooler before then but the big snap is crispy weather happens around then too

so jeju and busan will turn first  you can google fall foliage 2023 or other years and see maps like this for an outline 

httpsenglishvisitkoreaorkrsvccontentsinfobscviewdomenusn177vcontsid177021"
daejeon,"totally fair re seoul day trips

sorry if i missed it but are you hiring someone to drive or youre renting and driving yourself maybe its a difference in australian vs american english lol but i definitely recommend the latter for time flexibility reasons especially if something comes up with the toddler

i see where youre coming from and its a sound plan but think of it as this like you said since you planned on getting a car dont mind driving longer distances to do things and will have to anyways you figured it probably didnt matter too much where you actually stayed  then why not stay somewhere thats slightly quieter more scenic and more uniquely jeju you can do everything you mentioned elsewhere than jeju city but the difference is youd see more of jejus heart

seogwipo might not be the most of any of those but it still is one of the most major towns in jeju so i am certain you will find a nice hotel with the amenities and other things to fit your preferences we stayed there a night in a beautiful airbnb and loved it  theres nature and views waterfalls beaches and more urban things to do cafe culture good food spots etc if your son likes the beach maybe hamdeok or hyeopjae 

i feel really strongly about this because my friend and i did actually stay in jeju city at one point on our trip around jeju  we stayed the last night since we booked the first flight out back to seoul the next morning so it was easier to be as close as possible to the airport exploring jeju city after a week of seeing every other coast of jeju it was easy knowing who ranked last

so to answer the question of do i still recommend seogwipo over jeju  it isnt that jeju city is a bad choice by any means  that island is one of the most beautiful places ive been to and i am not an island person at all  you can do better i know that i am a stranger on the internet this is a family trip and you guys definitely are hoping to do another korea trip at some point in the future but personally the way i see it is that if you are going to travel somewhere foreign go see the heart of the culture youre immersing yourself in jeju city isnt where to do that you will see the korean metropolitan life in seoul and busan"
daejeon,10 day itinerary 
daejeon,busan has a great hiking path along the coast the igidae coastal trail i recommend starting at oryukdo sunrise park and hiking north to igidae park its about 47km and provides some really stunning views along the way its part of a larger trail haeparang trail 770km total if you want to extend your hike you can easily access by bus or taxi no car rental needed
daejeon,you should consider a night in gumi instead of daegu or daejeon
daejeon,"if you are heading from busan towards seoul by ktx then id usually recommend getting an accommodation near to busan station getting to the station with your luggage will be easier 

if intending to stop by gyeongju  daegu andor gumi like the other redditor suggested i would probably do something like book an accommodation in daegu for 3 nights and then commute to gyeongju  gumi the next and then daegu on the last day before heading to seoul it may even be possible to reduce one night at busan to add one more night to this section of the trip since more commute time will be involved  
if planned this way it might be worth looking at korail pass"
daejeon,do you fly on delta or korean air and can you amend your ticket to add on seoulincheon icn  busan pus flight to your international itinerary without incurring a big penalty
daejeon,thanks are there any places in gumi besides geumosan which you would recommend i unfortunately only speak english and looking at other posts in this subreddit it seems like gumi is not a english friendly city
daejeon,"thanks for the tip on korail pass i will look into it i was planning to mainly use ktx and metros for most of my commute so korail pass would probably come in handy 

i only intended to stop in gyeongju as the google images looked spectacular 

daegudaejeon were just going to be pitstops as i wanted to check out something less rather than exploring and getting lost in all the unique things which seoul has to offer 

so i dont mind other recommendations for semienglish friendly places within south korea i was looking at gangneung as it has something called as squid sundae which just sounds awesome im assuming that you can only find it there and not in busan"
daejeon,i fly delta codeshared with korean air so i should be able to change it to pus instead of icn any particular reason why you would recommend that
daejeon,not english friendly but the adventurous are rewarded with a truly beautiful city
daejeon,"if you are only stopping at gyeongju and staying there a night or two then korail pass may not be worth it but perhaps try doing a price comparison before deciding if a pass is better or if paying a la carte fares from gyeongju to daegu it may not be necessary to go by ktx since they are reasonably near it is possible to factor in gangneung if you get korail pass but that means you need to get to all these places within the pass validity period to make its money worth

also if im correct only the bigger cities like seoul busan and daegu have subway infrastructure  daegu has only 3 lines if that even counts so if you go to gangneung you can go there by ktx from seoul or daegu even but getting around within gangneung itself will be either by bus or walking ive been to daegu for a day trip before and actually relied more on buses to get around

i have a friend who went to gangneung just last month and i heard from her that generally the further you are from seoul and maybe busan the lesser english they use so do take note"
daejeon,"im landing at icn at xxxx and i want to go directly to busan how do i catch ktx train to busan or vice versa is a recurring question weekly if not more often almost no one knows the icnpus feeder flight exists even when it solves a big portion of their problem of multiple transfers on ground transportation hauling their suitcases around so i put this prompt to everyone who asks that particular question to the extent i feel like being a bot

granted not every inbound flight to icn is suitable for connection to said feeder flight because of the large scheduled gap during the day if the layover at icn is too long then the point of timesaving would be moot

but my point is that many people dont even realize that they can search for pus as the final destination and weigh the pros and cons to begin with let alone any extra cost considerations

for reference these are the list of the icnpus flights im talking about

ke1405  0625  0735  
ke1407  0825  0935  
ke1515  1710  1820  
ke1419  1825  1935  
ke1427  1935  2045

needless to say you pay for this leg if you choose it but its on the offer by korean air so you can make a better informed decision on the costbenefit even if you ultimately opt for ground transportation instead"
daejeon,thats actually a valid point
daejeon,yeah i figured till the bus signsstops are announced in english i should be ok else just use google maps as to where to get off thanks for the information much appreciated
daejeon,"i love the proactiveness brother i will definitely keep that in mind i always thought pus was a much smaller airport than icn and you need to transit to a domestic terminal in icn to head over to pus so was opting to take ktx as trains are always fun

i just am going to have one backpack on me and i land at icn around 10am so was just going to give a few hours for immigration etc and then take the ktx to busan around 2pm"
daejeon,incheon airport to yeongdonggun 
daejeon,"the layout of the network is that yeongdong is geographically on the seouldaejeondaegubusan corridor of which daejeon is an important regional hub therefore southbound ktx the bullet train calls at daejeon

but the journey time on ktx between seoul and daejeon is 1 hour you lose out 10 to 20 minutes for transfer at daejeon and a slow train to yeongdong takes about another 30 minutes your stationtostation net journey time then comes around full 2 hours

in comparison if you catch a slower train all the way from seoul without transfer then net journey time mostly comes around 2 hours 20 minutes you forego the hassle of transfer sit back and can even take a 2hour nap if you will unless every minute counts with your arrival into yeongdong a direct train would be a better choice

when you bookbuy a ticket you might want to pick an itxsaemaeul train over a mugunghwa just for comfort the latter is a lowergrade train using seriously dilapidated rolling stocks wouldnt recommend unless theres no alternative"
daejeon,"  
itx goes directly to youngdong it is basically the same as ktx but the operator is private company vs government owned ktx you can choose to get on at seoul yeongdeungpo or suwon station 

1 6007 bus to yeongdeungpo station itx to yeongdong station 3h20m

2 4100 bus to suwon station itx to yeongdong station 3h10m

3 arex to seoul itx to yeongdong station 4h

would recommend comparing trian schedules with your arrival time to see what fits your schedule best yes you should be okay to put your suitcases on the train

daejeon,thanks thats really useful specially the choice of train i thought they were just the same but different operators
daejeon,thanks really useful
daejeon,"all longdistance rail operations are under the state monopoly of korail bullet trains and conventional trains alike theres a separate legal entity running srt bullet trains out of seoul suseo station but its ultimately a subsidiary of korail using the same rolling stocks as ktxsancheon and nearly identical fare structure

so theres really no meaningful distinction between operators in korea half a dozen different train names denote service grades in the descending order of ktx of all subvariants  srt  itx of all subvariants  mugunghwa the otrains vtrains strains etc are special tourist trains and you dont touch them unless youre specifically taking that train tour you might see one such variant in yeongdong"
daejeon,how was yeongdong planning on going in feb
daejeon,twas good very small town but nice hill  park i found it relaxing wouldnt live there but a nice place to visit
daejeon,coooll my grandmother is from there thinking about spending a week there looks beautiful you think its worth a full week or should i do 5050 there  somewhere else wont have a car either
daejeon,not a full week it is veeery small and not many things to do i used it as my base of operations because i had free accommodation but there isnt much to do
daejeon,half a day in incheon and other day trips
daejeon,"theres literally nothing to do anywhere that early when you land and incheon isnt actually close to the airport anywhere you would go would still be like 45 mins away so just go into seoul 

and again nothing really opens until 11a anyway"
daejeon,i would not and wow that is a lot of places to visit
daejeon,a bit overkill with cities imo
daejeon,incheon airport to daejeon
daejeon,"the difference is minimal airport bus to gwangmyeong has to be concerned about traffic but it drops you off really close and its just short walk to the platforms good if you have lots of luggage

arexairport railroad is reliable however they involve a lot of walking something to be concerned if you have lots of luggage

in the end it just comes to preference"
daejeon,"icn  gwangmyeong 46 minutes
gwangmyeong  daejeon 47 minutes

icn  seoul direct 58 minutes normal 1 hour 16 minutes
seoul  daejeon 1 hour 6 minutes

around a 35minute difference per mapnavercom set to 130 pm on june 3rd"
daejeon,"because my son gets carsick really easily

then its arex express to seoul station  ktx for your family its a foregone conclusion imho

httpswwwairportrailroadcomcomaindohttpswwwairportrailroadcomcomaindo  english button on top this official website displays express trains exclusively

naver journey planner is capable of plotting a route by arex express train as much as by arex commuter train but you could get confused unless you already have sufficient knowledge of how the transportation network is set up as a whole"
daejeon,additionally do not use google maps they do not work in korea navermap or kakao map only
daejeon,i usually use both naver and google to compare and havent found them to be that different i know naver is supposed to be better but i like the google interface so much better naver is harder for people who dont know korean
daejeon,it really isnt i cannot speak korean at all and using naver is really easy for me
daejeon,4 weeks travel itinerary recommendations
daejeon,"after the end of the semester

be careful with the monsoon season which applies to both koreanormally starts mid june and japannormally starts early june"
daejeon,skip daejeon completely seriously why daejeon and absolutely add that time to japan instead
daejeon,should have mentioned that were staying in daejeon for the last week of the semester because of studies there
daejeon,youre attending kaist university arent you
daejeon,ah ok makes sense i do recommend you somehow add a few extra days to japan though if you can especially if its your first time there
daejeon,car or public transport 
daejeon,definitely train
daejeon,ive read on the same question and debated as well using a car in a foreign country especially if you dont know the language could get really stressful you might have some trouble with signsposts and find difficulty in parking spots etc the trains are actually quite efficient and public transport in korea is very reliable unless you know hangul and have had experience driving in korea before id advise against it
daejeon,"all the cities you mentioned are accessible by express train and are relatively wellequipped with public transportation so id recommend traveling by train

while i too personally enjoy renting a car and exploring during foreign trips considering the cities you mentioned im not sure if a rental car would be necessary im not sure exactly which option would be more costeffective or how much of a price difference there might be but id lean towards taking the train you could enjoy drinking soju or beer with your meal and you wont have to worry about parking either"
daejeon,no car you would be stuck with traffic jam
daejeon,"train or bus for tourism at 2  bus are cheaper like 1015dollar by people the car is a pain in cities red light take ages the most must see spot are into cities like seoul suwon and busan are a big no car needed but for country side its different since many spot need bus commute
the car add flexibility for hit all isolated spot along the way and there is ton of them its also cool if you like driving and road trip and there is clim inside
so if i resume no car in big city car for roam coast or mountain"
daejeon,cars are comfier but for first time or infrequent visitors i think public transportation is a large part of the experience that youd lose behind the metal and glass the thoughts and sights and sounds and smells are just not the same when youre driving maybe you could just drive for a few days that way you also get access to hidden places that are realistically inaccessible via public transportation like restaurants operating in random hills honestly koreas a great place to take buses subways and trains theyre clean cheap and reliable and you dont have to worry about getting dropped off in a dangerous street because they dont really exist
daejeon,"take the train i also like driving and would prefer renting a car when traveling but you do not need it here in cities like these 

it is cheap clean and on time if the travel times are too long for you by train taxis are also cheap i dont recommend driving bc there are some hilly and extremely narrow roads depending where your gps will take you there are even cars driving through crowds and as a nyc driver that would give me anxiety the parking situations also dont seem fun"
daejeon,if you are only visiting cities then you should only take public transport id recommend a car if you were doing day trips about of the city or you were on jeju but for your itinerary public transport is more than fine
daejeon,"i lived in korea for 9 years for the first 5 i only used public transportation and lots of places were definitely accessible by it in fact i thought there was pretty much nowhere i could not reach by public transportation in korea their public transportation is very very good for the last 4 years i had a car and wow i discovered restaurants beautiful nature and hidden gems i would have never come across were i restricted to just public transit i discovered the places that only koreans knew about that you would never find in western tour books without question that the best food i had in korea was accessible only by car 

with that said for a first trip to korea i would recommend sticking to public transportation korea is an incredibly dense country and there is so much one can do see and eat when using public transit for those whoever get the chance though on subsequent trips i would recommend also trying out exploring korea by car"
daejeon,car is definitely your best bet you can get anywhere directly speak freely with your family and actually be able to sit down time is money so in a sense it is actually cheaper too
daejeon,ktx ticket reservation
daejeon,you dont see anything when you go to checkrefund ticket menu of korailtalk app and put down your indentifying information
daejeon,my ktx ticket had a reservation number and qr code on it
daejeon,"hi did you manage to resolve your issue  i have the same problem  i had no problem booking ticket from seoul to busan had copy of tickets with qr code payment confirm on my credit cart  yet when i checked back on letskorail website i cant see my reservation using all emailpasswordcredit card information  but when i ask for reissue i can see all my tickets on their website

i am not sure if i should be concern fingercross the hard copy of my ktx will be valid  it has dates seating qr code on it

only problem i have now is booking a return trip as the site does not accept previous credit card i used"
daejeon,ohh ok it worked when i entered my credit card number case closed ill leave this post though in case someone has the same problem if email and password dont work try the credit card number
daejeon,no theres a blank page 
daejeon,you can stop by ktx booth anytime and they will print you a real ticket with qr code
daejeon,"thats rather strange are you redirected to the same blank page when you instead clicktap on the reservation list link on the email as shown on the image

or did you also try by credit card number or your own password other than email"
daejeon,spending the weekend in daejeon any suggestions
daejeon,"1 every friday saturday from 1800 to 2200 location central market night market
2 daedeok street beer festival 517518 location biraedong"
daejeon,expo skytower starbucks has nice view
daejeon,thanks 
daejeon,cities to visit with korail pass
daejeon,"if youre here for a month spend more than just 34 days plus whatever day trips outside of seoul the korail pass might give you some minor savings by using it over the course of a few days but youd be doing yourself a disservice by using it just to quickly see a couple other areas of the country i feel like its mainly meant for people who do short trips and want to do a whirlwind tour of the country before leaving again

busan definitely needs more than 1 day i always recommend 34 sokcho and gangneung i would say 2 days depending on what you wanna do skip daejeon and daegu theyre nothing exciting or special for a tourist jeonju and gwangju you might as well do 23 nights and do both of them together instead of going back and forth to seoul just to sleep 

korea is a small country but doing day trips back and forth across the country just to go back to seoul at night wastes a lot of time a month is tons of time to properly travel around the country if you want to see outside of seoul"
daejeon,skip daejeon hit jeonju if you can get to jeju make it happen
daejeon,"thanks for the info its just that we already have our hotel in seoul booked for the whole time and are not really the kind of people to travel around with our luggage all the time  not really backpackers i mean 
we are already going on a trip to jeju for 2 nights and would therefore double book a lot of nights if we went around the country renting rooms everywhere we are fine with going by train by nighttime and like to see a lot in short time periods so i appreciate your recommendation with gwangju and jeonju"
daejeon,"thank you for that info do you have any recommendations for either jeonju or jeju we will be in jeju for 2 nights and are planning to rent a scooter to get around the island a bit especially the southwest 
thank you"
daejeon,i totally agree with what you said its a pain to check out your hotel in seoul drag all the luggages with you to a train then when you get to your destination you usually have to wait to check in you loose so much time moving around and hotels hopping korea is a small country so doing day trip like you plan is not a bad idea at all i am inter in what you end up going for your day trip
daejeon,fair enough just dont underestimate the time it takes to travel around you might go somewhere thats only one or two hours via ktx but when you factor in doortodoor times taxisbuseswalking to and from stations it takes a lot longer than youd think
daejeon,"two days in jeju is not nearly enough and a moped on jeju is fun but its a big place probably bigger than youre imagining its the size of the us state of rhode island

i have many recommendations on jeju as i live here  southwest is the best place in jeju"
daejeon,you lose more time taking day trips to places that usually take a couple days to appreciate and doubling your time both commuting back and forth to ktx stations and sitting on trains doing day trips especially to the southern areas and going back to seoul at night to sleep is not an efficient use of time at all cities closer to seoul like suwon where you can see everything in half a day then sure
daejeon,thanks for reassuring me i will probably make a day trip to gangneung and sokcho might even stay there the night depending on how much i like it and because i want to go to seoraksan also i will definitely do the gyeongjubusan trip probably with just 1 night in gyeongju now with whats been recommended to me i think i will stop in gwangju for one day as ive never been to the southwest of korea before
daejeon,we are sadly on a bit of a tight schedule there snd our flights are already booked we were planning on going to the green tea fields of osulloc some hiking on hallasan and see the beaches is there anything in specific that you recommend
daejeon,"oh wow thats a packed two days for people on a moped i dont even think you can rent a moped here this island is much bigger than you seem to think 

osulloc is hugely overrated its a gift shop with a museum attached their tea tastes amazing but ive never met anyone who said they were glad they went usually the opposite

if you have only a day or two on jeju and no car i highly recommend an olle trail theyre up to 20 kilometers in length usually 1417 and go past scenic spots ugly spots and always have a little mountain to climb along the way trail 10 is my favorite these days other notables are trails 1 6 9 and 18 youll get a full jeju experience on any trail you choose except for 16 that one is pretty crappy 

moreover i highly highly recommend you rebook your flights and spend more time in jeju

hallasan is bigdeal hiking not for daytrippers who plan to rent mopeds there are some lovely and easy trails along its slopes and shoulders but you wouldnt even be able to reach the slopes most likely the roads up there are steep and my little chevy spark has a lot of trouble with the climb 

if you want a good beach and hike together hamdeok is beautiful and has an oreum mini volcano you can climb for a fantastic view of the north coast you may see horses and paragliders its part of olle 19

another great option would be to get bicycles and ride around the islands perimeter it can be done by athletic and motivated riders in 24 hours but that kinda defeats the purpose my point is that its pretty easy theres a marked bicycle trail just be mindful of local drivers because they wont be very mindful of you unfortunately 

otherwise for getting around jeju you should plan to use taxis or buses outside the cities buses are infrequent so youll want to research bus schedules ahead of time theres information online in english"
daejeon,well if you say that it would be much better to get a car instead of scooters we might consider that it might be easier to get around with thanks for the information we sre planning on spending modt of our time around the jejusi area anyways and just want to see some more of the island for the full day we have there
daejeon,gf and i want to travel to korea in august  goal is 14 days budget around 2000 each looking for advice
daejeon,"is the budget for flights  hotels  spending if so it could be doable but it will be tight 

when i was showing my friend around korea for 2 weeks back in january just accommodation relatively cheap but not too low quality and ktx cost us around 500 each lets say 1300 including flights 

that leaves 700 which is around 1000000 krw 

but including sim card and transit probably 900000 krw 

64000 a day per person its a decent enough budget but you wont be able to do a lot of shopping 

personally id try to take at least 1000 of spending money after flights and hotel to not be worrying about cash during the trip 

of course everything is subjective and depends on you you could technically only eat super cheap foods like kimbap and survive on like 10000 a day if you really wanted but its not really realistic"
daejeon,"i actually think 2k is kind of too tight for the places u consider to go

im going with 3 friends to korea this summer and were going 26 nights currently we paid
 1k for flight tickets could be cheaper flying somewhere else
 722 for airbnbs pp seouljejubusan total seoul was most expensive but we chose to settle in myeongdong
it was approx 30 euros per night pp but i guess you can find a little bit cheaper we found it important to have a bit space for the luggages as well 
in your case it would be 30 x 14  420
 120 euros for jeju flight i cant find any english info for ferries  jeju flight tickets are all only flex now when we tried to book it hence the 120 euros
 lets say you eat an average of 15 euros per day  15 x 14  210

if we go by your itinerary it would be 420  800 120  210 1550

what to consider still
 ktx one way is 74 euros i guess you can take slower trains for 35 euros 
 car rental in jeju or are you taking public transit
 activities costing money such as dmz tour like you mentioned
 simcard 

i think you will have roughly only 200 euros left as a buffergiftsspending which in my opinion is a bit risky but perhaps not for you 2"
daejeon,i know many dont agree but personally i would pick one busan or jeju considering travel times when you can check in and out of places i like to not have so many stops you would need to consider that for yourself and decide of course have you checked hotel prices for the weeks you are going those can vary depending on time of year you go as well im not sure about august because i avoid going then at all costs lol
daejeon,as you stay together in a hotel room you can easily make it with 4k 1600 for flights and 840 for hotels 60x14 leaves you with roughly 1500 thus 100 per day easily doable  maybe not if you intend of doing big shopping i really dont see an issue here even with sim 75k won and ktx to busan and jeju flight plus rental it is manageable as august is not a great travel time in korea hotels might be cheaper than junejuly  just book beforehand and you can manage your budget accordingly 80100 a day is plenty
daejeon,also consider that august is the busiest month for holidays among koreans transportation will be more challenging and costs may be higher
daejeon,"thank you for the detailed reply

our initial plan was 2000 each for flights hotels and spending but if another 300 would make a difference then well look to increase our budget a little we definitely want to do quite a bit of shopping

if you say relatively cheap accommodation what price ranges should i be looking at are there any hotels you stayed at you could recommend"
daejeon,"picking one of jeju or busan sounds like a hard decision to make 

i personally wanted to go to busan for the historical sites we are both history majors though in different disciplines and jeju for the scenery but i definitely agree constantly checking in and out every few days sounds like a hassle especially having to pack your bags every time etc

is august really that bad ive talked to a lot of friends who have been to korea before and the responses have been quite mixed from id never do that again to its not that bad tbh"
daejeon,i stayed at urbanstay boutique ikseondong when i was with my friend i really enjoyed that area around 63 per night for a twin room maybe its a bit cheaper for a room with only 1 bed
daejeon,busan barely has any historical sites the place for historical sites is in gyeongju
daejeon,send luggage back after exchange
daejeon,"the netherlands is one of the few remaining countries to which surface mail is still accepted you can find an extrasturdy doublewall corrugated box tape it around on all 6 sides and send it off by sea give it 3 months or so unless the houthis start shooting missiles at cargo ships again

an extra label for the delivery address printed in 72point font or so in addition to the official post office shipping labelinvoice would help reduce the chance of it going missing"
daejeon,daejeon zero oclock festival
daejeon,"httpwwwwalkintokoreacomnewsarticleviewhtmlidxno4118
an article about last years event

not sure where youre traveling to but daejeon is a bit far from seoul youll need to catch a ktx unless you rent a car or go the bus route "
daejeon,and yet another itinerary check post first time in korea going for 3 weeks
daejeon,removed
daejeon,"hey i happen to just hit many of the same cities except busan as you but this this is a lot 

on my trip like you i was a planner but i learned something about my experience in korea  in the end i got a lot more out of korea when i began to savor it and this is what im going to pass along to you especially since you are ethnically korean and going to korea for the first time 

i read through your itinerary and here is my feedback and much is not about your specific itinerary but things that impact your plans 

traveling in seoul and around korea will take a lot longer than you think you may have to rethink everything on your itinerary because of it especially once you see for it yourself the vehicle speed limit is generally lower compared to the states you might often find yourself grabbing taxis you will walk a lot metro train stations are deeper underground transferring between stations can be an experience etc but the mass transportation infrastructure is first class 

weather will also be another curveball for you it will be hot and humid during the summer be ready for it on other days you will have rain bring your raincoats and umbrella or borrow them from your grandparents 

also bring decent masks or just get them in korea i didnt use the masks for covid as much as the air pollution fine dust which caught us completely off guard it should be better in june though if you plan to have data plan which i recommend either by sim or through your carrier  google maps has option to show air quality readings  yeah on some days it could be that i still take my mask out because air quality readings can change by the hour

monthsweeks before you arrive 1 some helpful apps if you dont have them kakao kakaot for taxis  but on main roads it is sometimes just easier to flag a cab uber backup option google translate apps that have subway maps both in english and korean 2 get an international drivers license from aaa 3 book any necessary rental cars thru lotte rental car most foreign friendly and just can the collision insurance 

once you land sim card if you dont plan to use your carrier and a foreigner tmoney card for everyone in your group

food some of my thoughts herehttpswwwredditcomrkoreatravelcomments139z6jpcommentjj689ynutmsourceshareutmmediumweb2xcontext3 i honestly dont think its a big deal to try to go out of the way for common korean cuisine your local neighborhood has tons of good variety focus more on regional specialties like in daegu i really liked the pig intestines the daegu variety really opened my eyes in jeju black pig bbq and tons of seafood in seoul hanwoo bbq expensive street food and food in the basement of department stores 

im a fan of the specific parts of your itinerary for personal experiences concerts cafe tattoo and spas but i really enjoyed the korean folk museum and your dad may too by the gyeonbokgung palace and the secret garden by changdeokgung  two things you have not listed we also enjoyed seoul sky at lotte tower there is an experience there to be harnessed outside on the top 

i assume you considered taking the ktx to daegu then to busan but i understand that might be costly to you 

for busan  im not familiar

for daegu  not that unique to your itineraryexperience to see go spend time with family and get daegu food specialties 

for jeju  i would skip the north side and recommend you stay on the south side and preferably an airbnbtype accommodation grab the car from lotte rental car and drive it seems the islanders there are used to rental cars there and the roads are easy to drive in hyeopjae beach is ok and great for korea but for me beaches is not a korean specialty if youve been to the ones in the states 

lotte world is fun its not that much of an adrenalinerush type of park just make sure you go on a slower day like a weekday 

some museums and department stores may close on certain days make sure you double check monday is often a rest day

hope this helped have fun"
daejeon,"you can check out concerts on yes24 interpark and melon global ticketing sites not sure exactly when youre visiting but quite a few concertsfestivals during these two months 


i was blown away by  kakaomap  
127 dongsunggil jongnogu seoul httpkkotol4t4gquzq0 last time i visited and ill be going again im not a fan of  but their  was just amazing if its in your budget a fancy dinner at a hanwoo spot like born  bred or course dinner at bicena should be good experiences too"
daejeon,deleted
daejeon,did you go to these spas how did you find them and contact them
daejeon,very similar situation to you  korean american going w family in junei dont speak korean well lol also very similar itineraries i plan to do most of these things too color analysis shangpree lol only thing id add is a picnic at han river might dm you for recs for some things if thats ok lol
daejeon,"currently finishing my 2 week trip for seoul  busan  jeju i used to live in seoul and busan 57 years ago 
youll find you get some things done quicker than expected so can do more things from other days
temples and markets once youve seen a couple youve seen them all so may find you can skip a few 
haedongyongungsa temple is a must as its by the sea beomosa is in the mountains so a different vibe gyeongbokgung in seoul is a staple maybe im contradicting myself now 

the market in jeju is all hallabong orange themed so thats also a must 

you may need a couple of early nights after all the walking and eating 

i dont have any recommendations because everything is great and ive never been in korea with family to consider very excited for you"
daejeon,"im a big proponent of travelers visiting gyeongju it would be great if you could find a way to spend a day there as you travel from daegu to busan or busan to seoul

on day 5 the blueline park sky capsule ride seems out of place since its located in proximity with all the activities on day 7 

on day 7 i highly recommend taking the blueline beach train back from songjeong to haeundae near sunset if you can get the timing right a walk around dongbaekseom by haeundae is also really nice if you have time for it not too intense"
daejeon,"for day 5 

 gamcheon village closes at 4 i think so this is probably best earlier
 blue line park train is pretty great if you do an all day
 at busan tower play the minigame then if you pick a bad prize ask to upgrade to the soju glass

day 7 

 haedong yonggungsa temple gets very busy and can kind of be a bummer but still nice
 hongdea beach is good but if you can do blue blind beach train its cool to see it all the hike at the top of the beach is nice that goes out to the old light house

day 10

 lotte world tower is pretty great we didnt do the park as ive heard its very kids based if you do the world tower you can do the shit bridge which would tap that adrenaline i see you have this planned other days maybe consider olympic park which is right there to

day 11

 namsan is gorgeous hike up the side with the city wall on it its a great climb with great views maybe put a love lockmemory lock while up there

day 18

 coex is good pretty big but kind of weird layout
 banpo parking was crazy when we went but well worth it hanging out wish i had a bike to ride under it

general notes 

 the city wall museum is pretty interesting of youre near by
 lotte in busan has roof top lookouts that are nice"
daejeon,your trip looks great and gave me a lot of ideas may i ask though how you booked your facial with shangpree spa ive been trying to find an email of theirs that works 
daejeon,"i dont know if you know jain kim the korean climber she opened her own gym in seoul that i wanted to visit but didnt have time for maybe should check that out 

httpsinstagramcomrocklandsuyuigshidntc4mtiwnjq2yq"
daejeon,this is incredible thank you kind human
daejeon,"this is so detailed and much appreciated

we will be driving a personal car from seoul  daegu  busan  seoul but i will be taking the ktx from busan  daejeon  seoul if end up solotripping it to daejeon for my tattoo 

i definitely am going to have to take a second look at my itinerary these next couple days and just cut it down so i can have the time to enjoy the life in korea and not be so stressed about time and getting things done more of a personal thing i need to work on too 

thank you for all this though"
daejeon,will definitely check it out thanks
daejeon,removed
daejeon,lol i can be an intense planner which is not always a good thing thank you for your advice
daejeon,of course and enjoy your trip 
daejeon,oh and in jeju get the tangerines im not sure if they are in season year round but those were the best tangerines ive ever had
daejeon,im gonna be completely honest i didnt do too much research on the blueline park sky capsule ride but someone else on this sub commented on someone elses itinerary that it goes to the gamcheon cultural village so that was kind of my idea for that but i know no further details about the logistics of that or if its even a thing lol
daejeon,seconding the beach train
daejeon,ill pm you
daejeon,any chance you still have the feedback this person gave 
daejeon,havent tried it sorry saw a lot of folks ordering it when i was there though
daejeon,yeah i heard around octobermarch  is the season for tangerines outdoors but places still have greenhouses for tangerine picking inside is this true or is there a particular place you recommend for them
daejeon,omg me too im here now and no theyre not in season ive only seen a couple dodgy looking ones on the trees 
daejeon,hello uhomiegprotein do you mind sending me the email you used to book shangpree spa as well thanks
daejeon,i dont know if there are greenhouses but the best one i got is in a supermarket you may have to grab one from a vendor try it right there then grab more if they are good these vendors are everywhere
daejeon,if you go to the market they have hundreds so they must grow them indoors somewhere and you can buy freshly squeezed juice and also have free samples of the different types of them
daejeon,cycling route guidebook for korea
daejeon,thank you someone else linked your thread and its amazing great detailed guidebook i appreciate you putting this together
daejeon,looking for recommendations for inbetween destinations
daejeon,gyeongju busan and jeonju u could think about no idea why for daejeonz nothing to do there jeju for 5 days unless you like hiking too many days i guess explore gyeongju in spring season is gonna be good
daejeon,hey do you have any idea about atms at incheon airport t1 im gonna be landing very late and wanted to know if all the atms or atleast the global atms are in service 247
daejeon,most of atms are 247 in korea if you cannot find one on arrival floor go to departure floor most of case bank atms are better
daejeon,best hotels for a workation
daejeon,"intercontinental or park hyatt

otherwise your list is a pipe dream"
daejeon,budget is extremely important because that can all be had for several hundred per night
daejeon,"i recently visited seoul as a tourist and i have to say the city is fantastic highly recommend visiting the nseoul tower gyeongbokgung palace the historic hanoks traditional houses and the modern gangnam districttheres something for everyone

if youre planning a workation its worth using a special search engine dedicated to digital nomads i often use it myself when i travel for remote work 
you can check which cities in a given country offer accommodations suitable for a workation and both seoul and daejeon are listed as options
httpswwwtripofficecomrepublicofkoreahttpswwwtripofficecomrepublicofkorea"
daejeon,fairmont
daejeon,in seoul  check out local stitch seogyo creator town
daejeon,you can start with the lowest priced hotels that still provide good value
daejeon,straight up sounds like you need a travel agent
daejeon,bookingcom
daejeon,cheap eats
daejeon,"japan has the best convenience stores so i think youre gonna be disappointed when you get to korea haha 

but anyway that is a tight budget but it might be doable when using naver maps search  it translates literally to drivers restaurant and they specifically cater to taxi drivers for fast and cheap meals when theyre on the go but they welcome any customer it will be very basic food and service but youll be able to get a meal for like 6k9k won and it will be better than a crappy dosirak from the 711"
daejeon,that money translates to roughly 8000 per meal 2 meals a day you can easily find cheap and filling places to eat food markets kimbab places they serve kimbab and often some other basic korean dishes  however if you are eating at convenience stores in japan on that budget then youll probably do the same in korea korean restaurant food prices are comparable to japanese just slightly cheaper
daejeon,"korean restaurants typically have dishes that are like 78k won at the cheapest if you just get a bowl of noodle soup like that and eat two meals a day you might be able to pull it off but thatd be very difficult as others say your budget is realistic for one person to skimp on but two seems to overreach 

even convenience store food isnt that cheap if you actually want a real meal which would be like 6k won at least ive recently been living out of convenience store meals so i know"
daejeon,itll be tight but cheap places to eat at can be found they might be tricky to find on the go if you dont know the area though try looking for simple korean buffet places search for   or  on naver maps these wont be fancy places but theyll have simple and tasty korean food for about 710k per person and you can usually eat as much as you want
daejeon,"you may want to check out some of the places shown in this video httpsyoutubezlb6n6o9m7w

katsu curry for just 3000 won"
daejeon,"eur 25 is 35000 won in korean money  
it is difficult for two people to eat nutritious meals for a day with that money  
convenience store lunch boxes are about 5000 won these days  
its hard to survive with convenience store lunch boxes for 6 months  
create more travel expenses or adjust the travel period if that is too difficult"
daejeon,you can go to bunsikjip or there must be some cheap food like cupbap toast bapburger pho etc or maybe a taxi driver restaurant they are usually reasonable compared to the amount of food and quality but i havent been there for a while
daejeon,korean food is cheap as hell you will have no issues
daejeon,"very difficult thats about 35000 for 2 people to eat for a day  or less than 12000 per meal or 6000 per person per meal sorry thats unrealistic in my opinion

you need realistically budget 100000 per day per person not including accommodation if you cant you really cant afford to travel at this time  thats for food transportation costs personal care and incidental items"
daejeon,thanks to everyone for the help appreciate it 
daejeon,"convenience store food in korea is not as good as japan and somewhat more expensive and less nutritious however it is still an option  

i think seeking traditionally inexpensive dishes like kimbap would be your best bet"
daejeon,"there are lots of cheap places even buffets at 7k krw but as a tourist that is travelling you wont know them

like i always explore new restaurants with noodles for 5k krw or under but only after ive been running through the neighbourhood for weeks now

if you are just travelling and staying at a place for a short time its a lot of luck involved finding those cheap places lots of those places wouldnt be cheap if they would get more popular because they would raise the prices then so you dont find them easily

but in general kimbap stores have always cheap food kimbap and noodle stores are a safe bet for cheaper food often time selfservice side dishes with free soup and water"
daejeon,convenient store foods are cheap about 30005000won per meal
daejeon,"i realised this when i got to korea i was excited for the convenience store food but i quickly learned its not as good as in japan but theres lots of delicious food in korea i just had to be careful where i chose to dine but your budget is very tight for two people 

edit oh and convenience store food is not that cheap"
daejeon,bunsikjip is like kimpab heaven jongno kimbap
daejeon,"i dont think its unrealistic at all im in seoul and in my neighborhood there are a ton of of small korean snack places that sell stuff for less than 6000 eg the bibimbap is 5500 i saw some places that are even cheaper

so if i find this in seoul other cities should be even easier i have no idea what strategy you can put in place to find such places reliably though id say its harder near the most popular places and rich neighborhoods but it should be doable you can use naver map to quickly look the prices of the menus but some really cheap and small restaurants dont even have a naver detailed menu

if you dont find it you can use the convenience store but imo its really not healthy but it helps "
daejeon,what where in seoul are you finding bibimbap for 5500
daejeon,unrealistic no one wants to eat the same thing day after day for a few months
daejeon,i am in sillim near snu venture town in this area there are a lot of cheap option as this is a students place basically people come eat solo quickly then leave i just had a kimchi jjigae for 5000 
daejeon, then order different things  i gave example of dishes it doesnt mean its the only thing available i mean its mostly what i do myself
daejeon,yeah sillim is a cheaper neigborhood in seoul so that makes sense
daejeon,8 weeks trip in korea
daejeon,sounds like an incredible trip thanks for the overview i heard horror stories too especially about tattoos and my friend and i have full sleeves and i have small hand and a neck tattoos my mate is trans and 50 and im female over 60 everyone was so friendly especially elderly women who were constantly asking about my purple hair and a tattoo on my arm which is in hangul we hung out in itaewon and whilst we didnt try queer spaces given our ages we loved the neighbourhood i spent a week traveling by myself and had a wonderful and very safe time i keep saying to people now dont believe the bad stuff theres people that wont like you everywhere so ignore them and enjoy
daejeon,what a delightful summary of your experience d
daejeon,"it was  im glad to hear that you and your friends experiences werent negatives either i went to itaewon but it felt a bit empty it was the weekend before the birthday of last years events so i dont know if it played a part into this or if its because i went around 11pm 

honestly yes you cant please everyone i definitely got a few old people take a weird look at my tattoos but people usually ignore you or dont pay much attention so do the same and everything will go well"
daejeon,thank you im bad at summarises but glad you liked it haha
daejeon,busan to jeonju
daejeon,"just check on korail websiteapp wrt the timings of trains to get a better idea

edit theres a direct bus to jeonju from busan in case you dont want to switch trains"
daejeon,"making horizontal trip by train at the south of korea isnt a good idea because theres no express rails yet what youre seeing is the fastest route by rail which requires you to move northbound

expressintercity bus is the way to go busan bus terminalnear nopo subway station definitely has buses that goes to jeonju"
daejeon,usually theres a 2030 minute layover between trains when you transfer  station is small and you dont need lots of time to find your platform the direct bus is more convenient though
daejeon,didnt realize there was a direct bus thank you so much
daejeon,thank you so much i will look into that
daejeon,and where i can see the route of this bus in terms of landscape is a plus going by bus to busan thanks
daejeon,landscape wise buses are definitely better
daejeon,any advice on what to do in daejeon is anyone in daejeon right now
daejeon,it is the city of no fun just take ktx to seoul or there is also intercity bus to suwon
daejeon,lol daejeon just go to seoul as others said theres one good bakery there and i guess a science museum but thats really all there is to the city
daejeon,"hanbat arboretum daejeon oworld daejeon museum of art kaist shinsegae department store and some mountains bomunsan sikjjangsan etc

downtown area eunhaengdong dunsandong bongmyeongdongetc if you want to feel college life you can go to gungdong

you can also search festivals 

daejeon is my hometown yeah it might be a boring city but still some things to enjoy

hahaha 

x200b

enjoy  hope you can have good memories there"
daejeon,lol why does everyone think darjeon is borring i accidentaly found hanbat and the shoping area around skyroad is quite nice i cant imagine there should be nothing else to do here
daejeon,there is a nice geology museum
daejeon,go to dunsan or another city
daejeon,"watch this out first

httpsyoutubeub6glg8o7nghttpsyoutubeub6glg8o7ng"
daejeon,"it was voted as top1 nojamno fun city by koreans

even were clueless on what to do there"
daejeon,well thats something i think i already found the bakery so ill probably head for the science museum next
daejeon,yeah i live in sejong and also a lot people say exactly like about daejeon that its no jam city but i think only seoul and busan are jam city then 
daejeon,any chance you could repost this please link has died
daejeon,student accommodation in daejeon
daejeon,online and apps are plagued with bait and switch go visit a local realtor
daejeon,"rlivinginkorea has a great wiki with a lot of great information regarding rentals and options

usually its best to wait till you get here unless you can afford a higherend realtor because online photos rarely match what the actual place looks like and you dont want to pay money for someplace and find its not close to your standards when you get here 

most people book a hotel airbnb stay for their first week and then look for places once they are here unless you are looking at highend rentals you typically move in the day or week after the current tenant moves out  keep in mind that all rentals accept for a goshiwon will require a key money deposit that you will get back when you leave between 30100m krw for one to two roomstudios"
daejeon,ill try but what are the general turn around times would it be 1 month or 2 etc
daejeon,thank you that is what i have ended up doing airbnbs are relatively affordable too so its all coming together
daejeon,nope they want you to sign after they show you the place you specifically tell them you want immediate availability
daejeon,hey i will be soon in daejeon too can you recommend any realtor and what you did now exactly
daejeon,hey when ur visiting daejeon and ur going as a uni student or travel bcs am a uni student and will be there soon so looking for accommodations too
daejeon,hello ill be visiting daejeon in june as a university internship student so i was wondering if anyone could suggest me a realtor
daejeon,trip report vegan in korea 21120301 seoul gwangju daejeon
daejeon,i really appreciate this write up ill be there early next month and have similar concerns  especially intrigued by that rose tteokbokki is it suitable for a solo traveller to eat there thanks again 3
daejeon,thank you so much for this i am also an australian vegan traveling to sk soon gwangju and seoul and this is by far the most detailed and helpful information i have found i appreciate it
daejeon,"not me devouring this post as a vego perthite in my 20s about to head to sk as a first time solo traveller

honestly op thanks so much for this detailed post i was feeling a little anxious about finding food in korea but this really helps 

im not too fussy so worst case scenario i can buy some bread jam and peanut butter and pack that as i go out each day perhaps just make some sandwiches each day when im far from vegan restaurants"
daejeon,deleted
daejeon,hi im travelling to seoul in a couple of weeks will only visit for 4 days in total do you have any suggestions for places that i must visit and things i must do just in seoul
daejeon,im not even vegan but what a great itinerary you really made the most of your time  only exaggerating a little to say you did more with your two weeks or so than i did in most of a decade fun and inspiring to see whats interesting to motivated and curious visitors thanks for sharing
daejeon,next time you can get an americano or whatever from any cafe and then swing by a convenience store to grab a soyoatalmond milk carton like a juice box size and pour it into your coffee i was impressed with the altmilk options at korean convenience stores they even had unsweetened altmilks
daejeon,hey thereim a long time lurker first time reddit account creator just wanted to say thanks for a great write up on your trip to seoul im planning a trip in marapr and had similar questionsconcerns about vegan food options im really grateful to come across your detailed post so just wanted to send a note to say many thanks
daejeon,everywhere i ate was fine for solo diners  never had a problem as i walked in to restaurants just said for one when asked and they would showed me to a table hope you enjoy your trip 
daejeon,hey nah we just walked in  you can check their instagram pretty sure booking is only required for the monthly dinner service
daejeon,"depends what you enjoy really 

i think the war memorial  hangul museum  national museum is a good way to spend a day with three things that are close to each other that are educational and fun and are easy to spend an entire day exploring theres plenty of museums and galleries around seoul in retrospect i wish i went to some art galleries as well so could easily build an entire itinerary around those

if youre into kpop hybe insight was really good and is nearby the above three as well

if youre a foodie than cow tteokbokki vezza darcenciel and alta were all highlights for me albeit i only had vegan food cant answer if you want omni food

its also really easy to fill time just wandering around the city although i didnt include it in the writeup i did find myself just walking around gwangju and the hongdae area finding cool street art and different statuesmonuments

hope that helps "
daejeon,"thanks lurked on this sub a lot while planning the trip though i do wish more people did write ups when they got back home eg see 
rjapantravel which has plenty of posttrip posts so we can hear about how they enjoyed their trip instead of just how theyre enjoying planning haha"
daejeon,thats actually such a good idea will have to remember that for future travels
daejeon,"glad to have helped   make sure youve downloaded happycow on your phone and youll have no problem in the bigger cities 

if you have time and youre in the area the owner of lucyd in seoul is from chermsidekedron and they told us they wish that more queenslanders visited"
daejeon,suggestions for month long trip to korea
daejeon,"singaporean here whos been to seoul during precovid times public transport there is just as good as ours you can get by with both google maps and naver via bus and trains for directions i actually preferred google maps i cant remember why but to find business restaurants and certain places you have to use naver as they are not available on google maps what i did was find the address on naver than navigate via google maps reviews are also more available on naver than google although google has more english reviews plus it has a built in translation feature for korean reviews 

i chose airbnb cos im introverted af and dont want to speak to or meet anyone plus the hostels i saw all had small storage space and i had a big ass luggage 

i occasionally ate 711 and cu convenience store food to save money the food was pretty decent o

other than a completely different landscape navigating seoul is much like singapore easy to get around on foot and public transport english signs everywhere 

where you might have a problem is dining in restaurants not everywhere has english menus and english speaking staff were rare tbh bring google translate and use camera to translate menus etc occasionally i had to use live translate to speak with waiters too one thing that i found kinda jarring was that some restaurants dont let you dine solo so look into the places you want to eat at before you go there 

tickets for attractions and transportation is easily available via klook and kkday also can get portable wifi via those sites you might want to book certain toursattractions in advance i didnt get a chance to visit the dmz tour as i tried to book it too late 

cant comment on anything outside seoul though as i havent been elsewhere"
daejeon,"i havent been to all of those places but depending on your comfort with this kind of thing maybe youll see it as part of the adventure i suggest considering renting a car  at least when you are out of seoul i wouldnt drive in seoul  there are a lot of interesting things in the korean countryside that arent easily accessible by public transit  apparently in jeju renting a car or going on a tour is basically required if you want to really explore the island  even parts of busan i found to be a pain to get to by bustrain  car rental is not cheap though

if you do consider renting a car youll need an international drivers permit which you should easily be able to get in singapore  you wont be able to get one after arriving in korea if you decide to drive  if you drive in singapore im sure youll find korea outside of seoul to be a piece of cake  especially once you figure out how the tollroads work

i recently rented a car in busan and drove to tongyeong  definitely recommend a visit  beautiful spot  also visited namhaedo which i enjoyed

as for train vs bus  bus will be cheaper but train generally faster especially ktx  its the classic what do you have more of time or money dilemma  i know korail has passes but im not sure how much of a value they really are

i would recommend getting a t money card  you can get one at a convenience store at the airport  it saves you a lot of hassle of fishing for change riding busessubway and you get about a 10 discount on the fare  you can also use the card on many vending machines as well some taxis and convenience stores among other places

google maps wont give you proper routing in korea  for that i think the best app in english is naver maps  the problem though is that naver maps areas of interest doesnt search well in english  so i found myself finding the names of places in korean and cuttingpasting into naver maps  if something was nearby and i was just going to walk and navigate myself i found google maps the easiest

for places to eat i found an app called mangoplate useful mostly in korean but it does a good job of autotranslate

enjoy"
daejeon,i want to add gapyeong area such as nami island and garden of morning calm to your list if i remember correctly it takes an hour or two by train from seoul station i spent a whole day there and its one of my favorite places in korea
daejeon,"gyeongju and busan wouldnt need 45 days recommend 12 full days for gyeongju and 24 full days for busan i did train from seoul to busan dont book online i paid 54usd and the ticket was about 30usd at the station you need to print the ticket at the station and it lists the price busan to gyeongju was only an hour away and i took the bus because its a lot cheaper than the train option and i read the train drops you off on the out skirts of gyeongju 
myeongdong is kinda dead for the night markets and i recommend renting a hanbok and walking around the palaces for a day also if you have some free time i suggest getting facials or lasers at muse clinic in gangnam make reservations online they dont upsell or push you for treatments and speak english suggest booking an earlier time or set about 2 hours for the treatment"
daejeon,you might like naeyeonsan a mountain with a hiking trail with twelve waterfalls a bit north of pohang which is north of gyeongju  we didnt actually make it there because my daughters ankle was hurting but i hope to someday  i have a sixminute video of our trip herehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvl8hkjx8lgpa  turn on subtitles for place names
daejeon,suncheon is dope and yeosu is nearby i would also highly suggest you cut daejeon and double up on jeju i lived in jeju for a year and still go back for more especially in the summer the beaches are amazing geumneung beach is the best in the island and ive been to literally all of them ive done the jeju olle trails that circumnavigate the entire island i also lived in daejeon a year and while daejeon is fine to live in it has absolutely nothing notable that you cant do better in seoul the only exception is if you have friends there or if you have an affinity for universities kaist
daejeon,thank you definitely will need a translator as i barely know any korean what are some of your favorite places in seoul if you dont mind sharing hahah
daejeon,was it common for restaurants not to let you dine solo
daejeon,best app for me to navigate in jeju really was kakao maps but in seoul ive used citymapper its in english and worked really well
daejeon,"i dont have a drivers license yet 

heard jeju would be tough without a car some  recommend to get a bike in seoul though might try that out as i love biking anyway

i have lots of time hahah really want to take trains as well especially the sea train will check out the passes

definitely will be getting the tmoney card not sure if i wanna get the korea tour card though probably only gonna visit the seoul tower

thanks for all the suggestions"
daejeon,looks awesome thanks for your suggestion
daejeon,"thanks for the advice might actually do my trip in reverse then seoul  gyeongju  busan  samcheok

since there is the train from seoul all the way to busan train to busan heh"
daejeon,ooo sounds dope thats unfortunate but i loved your video do you know if the sea train stops near naeyeonsan really wanna check it out
daejeon,"jeju is right up there on my bucket list i love beaches and nature trails already have many on my todo list hahah might be going there twice as my summer school at kaist might bring me there for a school trip again 12 days probably

will check out suncheon and yeosu do you have any tips for jeju seeing youve been there for quite long im thinking of taking a flight from busan but my plans are still not set in stone so i cant book the tickets yet"
daejeon,"seoul tower was a great view point i 1010 regret climbing up that mountain rather than taking the cable car i sweated my ass off even though it was 3c 

gwanghwamun square and castle is a mustsee 

absolutely loved the korean war museum if you have been to ns you can kind of appreciate the kind of shit they went through for their country really gives you a perspective of national pride 

the national museum was good but only if youre into museums of historical relics and stuff not nearly as good as the war museum however grim that may seem 

although my favourite thing to do in seoul was to just take long walks along the numerous streams and rivers that run through the city super beautiful to see nature thriving all kinds of fish insects and birds were in the stream right next to my airbnb and i spent nearly every night observing them before heading back to sleep and starting my day off taking in the fresh morning air there too 

in hindsight at the time i went i hadnt seen a single kdrama yet now as a seasoned kdrama addict id visit all the spots my fave dramas were filmed at if i could go again 

side note i found the night market food to be very underwhelming compared to taiwan and japan or even our pasar malam unless you die die want to try the foods there my advice is to skip it pretty much anything they sell there you can find in sg tteokbokki korean chicken wings bulgogi corndogs etc are all available here so dont bother go for the authentic restaurants instead"
daejeon,ooo might have to download kakaomaps then didnt know citymapper also works in korea nice
daejeon,"i would really recommend cycling around jeju there is a marked route around the entire coast just follow the blue line and you can manage it in three days with still enough time to stop and take in the sights of the main towns along the coastline 
there are bike hire places on jeju city so start and finish there and if you like hiking you can then climb hallasan but make sure to book that in advance 
if you choose to do the cycling around the island id also recommend picking up a bicycle passport as you can collect stamps along the way and its a nice souvenir  and in other places in sk if you decide cycling is a good option for you httpswwwbikegokrengcontentdokey2009110791806"
daejeon,my korean friend told me you can get around with bus on jeju using kakao maps it shows the bus driving live and the routes as well i would recommend a car but bus is still fine if youre going to the touristic places there one thing i really recommend is the hallasan hike if youre into that it took me 4 hours to the peak including breaks in between the experience on the way to the top and the view of the top was amazing but if you dont have time then there are plenty of other things to do in jeju
daejeon,doesnt look like it  i dont think it would be super easy to get to but it looks like theres a bus to goes to bogyeongsa temple where the trail starts from pohang terminal  pohang itself is a nice areamaybe you could squeeze that in along with gyeoungju
daejeon,"yess i have a few of these historical sites on my map already love these kind of things and nature my first kdrama was crash landing on you haha recommended by a friend and watched it while i was bored to death during ns

will keep that in mind when visiting seoul tower"
daejeon,used both my whole trip 15 days ago 
daejeon,oh wow thats really cool
daejeon,yess i love nature trails and mountains something i cant find in singapore adding that to my list
daejeon,"get the 510 bus from pohang train station  im researching  
edit or bus 5000  i found a couple of things that said 510 but both naver and kakao maps say 5000"
daejeon,thanks will do more research myself too
daejeon,stopping point between namhae and seoul
daejeon,songnisan  is a cool area with small town vibes and great local food not too far from daejeon beopjusa is a nice temple to visit and the surrounding nature is beautiful
daejeon,thanks for the idea it sounds perfect and ill look into it
daejeon,messing around with chat gptit wants me to visit nami island
daejeon,daejeon lol
daejeon,i question its intelligence
daejeon,you can skip mireuk mt bro lol  visit the stupid jewelry museum if you are going to go to iksan lol
daejeon,if you need ai to plan your vacation stay home 
daejeon,i found it amusing that each of these places apparently warrants exactly two days to see it
daejeon,ah didnt even notice have you tried to give it specific instructions to avoid that and to avoid nami
daejeon,i should try that
daejeon,daejeon  suggestions for things to do
daejeon,dunsan at night is fun
daejeon,dunsan is really about your only option in that city
daejeon,"when we were in daejeon we went to costco

you can also check out the very famous and popular bakery at the train station   sung sim dang bakery "
daejeon,"most koreans ive met said dont go

theres a car cafe there thats kind cool

never really spent much time there myself though"
daejeon,it is the city of nofun
daejeon,"went there recently to see a korean friend of mine daejeon has a bad reputation for being boring but i enjoyed the expo park night show fountain and music with all of the food trucks i sat and had a beer after touring the park itself during the daytime theres also a light show on the main expo tower not sure if its limited to certain times of the week or year though or if its good to mingle with others if thats what you are looking for 

i also heard from the same friend that daedong sky park is pretty at night with nice restaurants cafes and a good view of the city again more of a chill vibe but taken from a daejeon native"
daejeon,19 days trip suggestions help
daejeon,"ill tell you a few words if im not too involved in your trip

i think seouljejubusanother regionsseoul is a desirable route

its okay to use an airplane from seoul to jeju and a ship from jeju to busan

if you take a boat at night from jeju you can arrive in busan the next morning which is a way to save one day of accommodation

august is the peak season so you have to make a reservation 1 to 2 months in advance

take ktx when you come back to seoul from busan

since seoul is a big city and has been the capital of korea for a long time you will be able to experience many things such as shopping sightseeing food museums and history

gyeongbokgung palace is a symbolic palace in korea

i recommend you to visit

it will be a fun memory because you can rent hanbok near gyeongbokgung palace

jeju is a city of recreation so about 4 nights is appropriate

but jeju island in august is a tourist season

you can get tired due to flight reservations accommodation reservations high prices etc

i recommend black port bbq and seasonal sushi for jeju food

transportation is not a wellequipped area so you have to spend a lot of time traveling

i want to oppose it for 4 days in busan so its complicated and theres not much to seetheres only youth on the beach in busan

i recommend gyeongju which is not far from busan

it takes half a day to get back from busan and has a lot of cultural history

hwaseong fortress is good in suwon but thats all about suwon

sokcho gwangju yeosu and tongyeong are too far from your route

try new food if possible

i cant recommend your food because i dont know your taste

if possible i would like to go shopping in seoul

please purchase the gift items in jeju or use the dutyfree shop

seouls history museum war memorial hall and dmz tour would be good for the museum

the water park is about a 3hour drive from seoul

everland water park is the most used facility

there is also a shuttle bus running in seoul

other areas have famous water parks

it is also okay to visit jeju citys 5day market which opens only on the 2nd 7th 12th 17th 22nd and 27th of every month

its okay to go to namdaemun market in seoul namdaemun market is famous for braised cutlassfish

the most famous beaches are jungmun beach in jeju island and haeundae beach in busan

the accommodation in seoul is a place where many tourists gather but i dont want to recommend it

hongdae is young but i dont like it because its messy and not tidy

anyway i dont know if thats the answer to what youre curious about

if you need more information please comment and i will share everything i know

depending on how far youre going to see and what youre going to experience

i think it can be a long time or a short time

trying to experience too much can lead to failure

i hope you plan well and have a good trip

daejeon,"i went to seoul and busan in august last year and going again this year all i can say is make sure you carry fluids it gets really really hot and humid 

however when i got there there was a big heatwave going on so maybe it wont be as bad this year 

there are a lot of historical sites in busan if you enjoy hiking the mountains in busan are littered with walls lookouts gates fortresses and the view at the top of them are amazing"
daejeon,hi thanks so much for all the detail and recommendations super helpful i had no idea you could take a boat to jeju i think i will do 3 days in busan instead of 4 and ill check out everland water park
daejeon,is south korea for us
daejeon,"what have you enjoyed about other places youve been

i love korea but prefer to spend more time outside seoul than in it"
daejeon,"i think south korea has a lot to offer in terms of hiking tons of beautiful mountains and some coastal ones

i think seoul has a lot of cultural spots but its very much overshadowed by the shopping and nightlife and the glamour as a city then again what types of culture are you into historictraditional seoul got the palaces modernartsy fartsy it got a few good museums though also many sights commonhigh on the tripadvisor type lists are very much a social media happy place rather than substantial cultural landmark imo

i think busan is great but its a much smaller scale and spread out and thus has fewer of many things unless you include gyeongju as busan

it might work better if you share where else you have travelled that you enjoyed and why and the community could give you better feedback on it"
daejeon,"which countries have you been to which ones did you like or not like and why

honestly its not like america where every city has a unique history  korean cities are all pretty much the same  seoul is just bigger"
daejeon,if you like tokyo then you will probably like seoul  both cities were previously completely destroyed during wars so there isnt much historical places to visit  but when it comes to eating shopping looking at cute designs and people everywhere both cities are good along with both having a fine rail and metro system
daejeon,"tldr i would recommend daejeon area or daegu if you want to stick to metropolitan citiesalthough cheongju might be the best fit for you overall

cheaper more access to nature and more centrally located for shorter travel times around the peninusla  here we go

busanulsanchangwongimhae have a great urban culture although ulsan and changwon are more neat than busan imho but itll be difficult to get to gangwon jeonju etc  also the sea would be great but hiking and outdoorsy stuff would be lacking maybe have to bus out to jinju tongyeong etc

gwangju has a very particular culture which i would love to experience having lived in daegu but not for first timers

seoul has a reputation as a newbie trap flashy lights and fun to visitbut maybe not to live

daegu has hiking opportunities like apsan along with a big urban area of 25m people and short transit times to mountainous regions like yeongju and chungju and the ocean like pohang and busan  you can also get to jinju by ktx and jeonjugwangju by bus  you can explore the entire plain of gyeongsangbuk surrounded by the east sea and multiple mountain ranges

in terms of connectivity daejeon would be best  the area around daejeon is more flat and less rugged compared to daegu though and the population would be less at about 15m with a flatter nightlife to boot  however getting to all areas of korea will be quicker with the hubs of osong and cheonanasan stations very accessible cheaply and from there the mountainous chungjujecheontaebaek corridor as well as the jeonjuiksangwangju corridor and even the yeosu area off iksan

all of which leads to my suggestion  cheongju city  its about 800k but the urban center and nightlife is big enough so you wont get bored  osong station is in cheongju and it borders cheonan and daejeon so you can get around the peninsula very easily and cheongju starts the gorgeous chungjujecheontaebaek route i mentioned before  also cheaper and a sizable foreign community

give it a shot in a country where you can get from seoul to busan in less than 3 hours living in the middle gives you a cheaper life and more nature without losing your access to megalopoli  a smaller city might be the best balance"
daejeon,"edit i initially read your post as a lifemove thing like youd be here for a year or something retrospect i misread edited some parts below to make it more applicable but might have missed couple spots 

south korea has tons to offer really as new comers i would heavily encourage you see seoul and busan both can travel between via ktx but i would recommend preresearch on how to get tickets as an english speaker another spot depending on time is jeju a lot less on the urban side but depending on season may be worth checking out as its a popular domestic vacation spot 

that said if you like urban centres that are rich with a sense of adventure but still have some hikingbiking yeah you didnt say biking im projecting my own interests a bit activity nearby honestly the latter can be found almost anywherenear any city but the former is the best in seoul there are urban centres within seoul to fit any flavour you want highclass to holeinthewall to quasipocha districts which are like outdoor eat and drink spots that open at certain times 

for the hiking and biking bit the river which cuts through seoul is great for both walks and biking tons of cool foothillsmountains around to hike as well 

i lived in korea which is a different lense in my opinion from observing some posttrip posts here korea can be a difficult spot sometimes to travel depending who you are i think there are a lot of koreaboos korean obsessed westerners who are young and maybe lack life and travel experience to really know how to put themselves out there and have fun and the language barrier adds a whole other thing which again if you lack travel experience or are ignorant enough to think  korea can speak english would make it tough to travel here plenty of english friendly spots though once you know where to go 

that said it really is a rewarding place to travel and shortterm live for fun tons to due and relatively easy to travel due to its smaller size"
daejeon,"busan is prettier than seoul imo because it is near the sea it reminds me a little bit of honolulu just bigger

however in general most korean cities are going to look very similar to each other and none of them are going to be as pretty as european cities for example seoul is a fun city but i would never call it pretty after living here for three years haha

korea has some of the best hiking in the world though and there is a lot of culture and history to learn about if you come people dont often realize that korea is one of the oldest continuous societies in the world

i would definitely recommend coming"
daejeon,"daejeon daegu and cheongju have absolutely zero value allure and appeal for tourists seoul is a massive city but it absolutely caters to foreign visitors above and beyond 

ive lived here 11 years and have no desire or need to go to daejeon"
daejeon,"i actually thought they were staying a bit longer because they mentioned staying in multiple cities  i recommended cheongju as a jumping off point because youre going to be passing through osong station the most if youre traveling the country  for short term tourists it wouldnt be ideal i suppose

it seems like your position is stronger and that only seoul busan and maybe jeonjuandonggyeongju have any value  perhaps that is true from a certain point of view and ill certainly avoid debating it"
daejeon,"if you are mikesaidyes i dont want to know mikesaidno

edit i dont disagree with you  for most tourists it makes more sense to stick to seoul or busan and id heavily slant towards seoul especially for op since they voiced interest in urban centres"
daejeon,2 week korea itinerary  thoughts suggestions and queries
daejeon,"ive done gyeongju by bus and with a rental car bus does take longer but its definitely possible if youre a good hiker you can go straight up or down the mountain between bulguksa and seokguram i hear it takes about an hour there are buses at either end the road is winding and annoying  


my family loved yeosu  hyangiram hermitage is fantastic if youre up for a lot of stairs"
daejeon,"hi all

im still waiting to hear how the train situation works do i need to buy a ticket for each occasion or can i tap with a tmoney card would an tourist korail pass work better on the days im taking multiple trains"
daejeon,"thats great to hear about yeosu i posted in another group and people were telling me not to go there but it looks really nice and relatively straightforward to get around so not sure why

gyeongju definitely looking like something ill need to plan out which attractions i can get buses between and frequency"
daejeon,transportation options in korea
daejeon,"all cities that i know of accept the tmoney card for ridership also if you buy the card in seoul you can use it busan or daegu or wherever just make sure you keep topping up the card with cash either at a kiosk in a subway station english menus usually available or at any convenience store

youll be fine with the tmoney card in middlesized cities and even the small cities worst case scenario you can always carry 2030000 krw and buy a singleride pass for a subway and most buses still accept cash

always be sure that when you leave a bus that you scan your card on the way out also you dont have to but if you intend on transferring or catching another bus or subway within 30 minutes scanning the card on the way out will ensure that your next scan counts as a transfer low or no cost and not a new ride full cost good way to make sure you save a few krw if you plan on using a lot of public transport and i recommend that you do koreas public transit is toptier"
daejeon,"tmoney is the easiest way to get around on public transport i use mine everyday and have used it all over the country no problems i suggest you keep smaller amounts on it less than 20000 and top it up a little more frequently just in case it gets lost in cities with no subway and no card reload machine you can add cash to it at any convenience store just hand it to the cashier with the cash amount and say     or tmoney choongjeon haejuseyo which means please refill my card

also a super helpful app is the tbalance check app to see the balance left on your card the card readers on buses will also tell you the balance left over

youll be fine in smaller cities with no subway lines i live in one and get around just fine using the buses theyre very efficient"
daejeon,"going to be a combination of taxi bus and train depending where youre headed to at the time long trips the train for sure intermediary trips might be better on a bus short trips or trips out of the way might be better in a taxi 

typically the bus or train will be the cheapest way to travel by a wide margin however you might be looking at like a 3 difference to take a taxi and avoid 1015 mins of walking plus waiting for the trainbus then a longer ride as well"
daejeon,"the tour card is just a glorified more expensive version of the tmoney card either will do

ive been to all of chuncheon sejong and daejeon and you will do fine with your tmoney card on all forms of transit tap in and its a good habit to tap off of a bus in case you need a transfer

what are you going to sejong for unless the national tax museum excites you there really isnt much there since its a newly planned city you might enjoy suwon a lot more particularly for hwaseong fortress and the gimbap store from extraordinary attorney woo"
daejeon,not really sure about sejong it was just a city i saw on google maps and thought thered be something to see there we wanted to get as much of korea as possible in 2 months suwon is definitely our radar as i heard theres actually things to do there i was basing places to go just off the google maps and see if theres anything worth seeing in a specific city love woo young woo thanks for the info
daejeon,i wouldnt go to sejong its a city for civil servants and government officials and most buildings are administrative not much to look at in tourism perspective
daejeon,new mod  hello everyone
daejeon,god bless you i couldnt do all that extra work haha
daejeon,deleted
daejeon,welcome and congrats on the promotion
daejeon,its a bit of a hobby lol
daejeon,im what sense nature historical
daejeon,"i guess i can answer in general   

more boseong  boseong is a place most people go to the tea fields so i am assuming you went to that however at the south end of boseonggun are mudflats that still have the imprints of dinosaur eggs it is also the site of the largest depository of jurassic period tracks ever discovered on earth korea tried to make it a thing and the that thing they used to do in the 90s where they tacky up the hell out of a place that would have otherwise been cool to a niche set of people but ruined it korea submitted the area of unesco world heritage consideration and it got rejected not sure why but probably because they ruined it so as an added bonus to the dinos there are abandoned buildings of an outdoor museum i have a thing for abandoned things here more below   

ganjingun  the goryeo era is known largely for its 13th century celadon which is considered to have techniques a good 200300 years ahead of its time by comparison the joseon celadon of centuries later and ming dynasty celadon blows it was largely produced here and the remains of the celadon kilns still remain along with a couple completely intact 800 yr old kilns another unesco world heritage reject this one was koreas first bid in 1992 again korea thought this would be a thing and made a whole celadon land complete with museums camp sites and even a celadon pool and buildings with celadon tiles it is also largely abandoned the big draw were legit workshops and shops where celadon is still sold but many figured long ago that with koreas super cheap shipping it was easier and more profitable to just ship it to the rest of the country instead of expecting others to come to it the museums in the area though are indeed top notch and its worth wandering around you will see tons of abandoned things including a failed vr tour   

sado island  part of the jurassic period bid was this island off the coast of yeosu which still has footprints around there were dino tours but even prepandemic it was long delayed and later abandoned sado does have 2 dino statues to greet you and i do mean only you when i went i was the only visitor even slightly interested only 10 people in the tiny boat and only 4 of us got off one lived there another came for fishing and my wife and i the water is shockingly crystal clear and theres an isthmus that connects 2 other islands and you could walk to a 4th in low tide though not recommended in any case a nice overnight place bring your own food though because there is 1 restaurant and 1 convenience store but both regularly close during holidays i went for chuseok and was fucked    

the last i hesitate to recommend but bigeumdo it has amazing salt flats that recently were added to unescos list along with suncheon however and this is a big however it is also a known place to house modern day slaveshttpsenwikipediaorgwikislaveryonsaltfarmsinsinancounty

daejeon,just a heads up that bts are having a free concert in busan on october 15th so expect that the days prior after and especially on the 15th public transport might be super packed hotel prices are also rising ridiculously because of it
daejeon,"depending on what your looking to do in damyang you may be able to too it and the bamboo forest in one day the forest is not big at all 24 hours not really a full day then the rest of damyang besides meta province which is walkable 45min1hr from the forest is mostly hikes and spread out through out the area

to add to the previous commenters mention about busan the hotel mark up has places that are usually 200000 krw a night going for 1200000 krw a night i would book it asap or change your itinerary around those dates"
daejeon,thanks that made me laugh out loud that explains why busan was so expensive
daejeon,the hotels have been booked for busan just noticed the lack of options during that period on bookingcom 
daejeon,recommendations for a seasoned traveler
daejeon,"ulleungdo  we went with our two kids and it was amazing  
i want to hike naeyeonsan north of pohang which has 12 waterfalls  juwangsan also looks really cool"
daejeon,what do you recomend for a  12 days trip first timer
daejeon,im not sure if its a historical site naju image theme park  is artificial joseon village used for the shooting of historical kdramas it should be open for visitors to roam the village
daejeon,ah yes i always forget about ulleungdo definitely need to find the time to get out there eventually and ill check out those mountains thanks
daejeon,well i guess it depends if youre willing to move around the entire country or if you want to stick to a regionlast winter a friend and i used the korail pass to explore the north east coast sokchogangneungsamcheoketc for 9 days by train but im sure it could be condensed if you want to explore another region as well id need some more info to give useful advice haha
daegu,best way to travel from incheon airport to daegu 
daegu,"the issue you might be having is that korail does not handle the airport train  httpswwwairportrailroadcomhttpswwwairportrailroadcom   from incheon to seoul even though it does have incheon airport t1 in its station list after arriving to incheon t1t2 you hop on the 14000 krw arex airport railroad express to seoul in seoul station you then buy a ktx ticket to dongdaegu

at seoul stations there are elevators seoul station  ktx train is wheelchair accessible if your parents want that as an option

im not in korea but maybe this helps daegu is a smaller station with max itx speed train dongdaegu is connected to srt and ktx trains dongdaegu is 10km from the other daegu station still in daegu

daegu,theres only one flight ke1433 at 1840 from icn to tae and you can connect to it airside transfer only if you take korean air delta or american on the international leg though tae and pus connectors are timed to accommodate many afternoon arrivals from north america including aa flying in from dfw you cant know whether itd be feasible unless and until you actually run a journey planner ideally you should have 152 hour layover at icn to secure extra buffer though the system will still project a connection with just 55 minutes eg korean air atlicntae
daegu,airport limousine bus to dongdaegu station  takes about 4 hours  if you have a lot of luggage its the easiest way  buy tickets in the arrivals lobby buses are right outside
daegu,oh my gosh bless you this was an incredibly well thought out and helpful comment thank you really really appreciate it i knew there was something different about the incheon to seoul stretch but couldnt remember this will help so much when booking
daegu,one site to visit on the way from seoul to daegu car travel
daegu,"sayuwon
82 543831278
httpsmapsappgooglub38hjhjszbvzklv6

it would need a whole day but my friend told me about this

its not very well known even in korea but looks stunning and you need a car to visit"
daegu,how out of the way are you willing to do imho any world heritage site or on the tentative list is worth stoppinghowever some are more out of the way than others haeinsa comes to mind
daegu,andong hahoe village and the byeongsan seowon confucian academy are just slightly off the trail and very popular sites to visit hahoe village was interesting but i really liked the atmosphere of the seowon
daegu,"wow that is stunning

i found on the web that you need about 3 hours to walk through and see each and every aspect of the arboretum i hope well manage to make the road and the visit to this place in one day

thank you so much"
daegu,have you been to this i started looking into it because of your comment and it looks amazing
daegu,"haeinsa

well i dont think we could go to the seaside but id say one hour on detour is okay

haeinsa looks doable but still a bit ordinary just another temple i cant say that its bad but now sure it will justify

anyway  thanks for the idea"
daegu,my friend recommended the whole day to be fair so not sure if it would work for you with all the driving  but it does look absolutely incredible
daegu,"i didnt quite have the time nor energy in the end

my friend from daegu told me about it she highly recommends it"
daegu,the tripitaka koreana is the reason to visit not the temple itself
daegu,oh awesome i actually found your comment while searching for things to do in daegu i might change it to a trip to sayuwon and gunwi now
daegu,ive read you need a reservation to enter the building that holds the tripitaka but cant find where to make one do you know how to make or if you need to make a reservation
daegu,"oh yeah they sound much more fun than daegu tbh

let me know if you make it to sayuwon"
daegu,download the 1330 app and ask there korean tourism its 24 hours and free and in english
daegu,i went ages ago and didnt need one
daegu,i want to find ktx round tickets from seoul to daegu i searched on korail official websites there are no tickets of ktx direct train that travel between two cities on the other hand i found ktx ticket in rail ninja travel directly between two cities how is it work
daegu,search for dongdaegu rather than daegu i chose a random date and there were plenty of tickets available and as the other person said please dont use railninja and only book directly from the official website
daegu,when are you wanting to travel you cant book more than a month in advance there are definitely direct routes between seoul and daegu also never use railninja its not an official seller
daegu,which station are you using ktx doesnt stop at daegu station  only dongdaegu  and srt doesnt go to seoul station  only to suseo
daegu,there are a ton of itx trains going to daegu station that day and also ktx trains going to dongdaegu station book seouldaegu and daeguseoul separately instead of looking for round trip on one ticket
daegu,going to siggraph asia
daegu,"rail ninja is fine but youre going to pay a premium because theyre a broker not a distributor  might beable to pull up the inner city train on the app the train ultimately goes to busan so might have to look at that and change it from there 

some times your hotel will book it for you if you call them and ask them to but may be too far out for that"
daegu,i have done the train to daegu  if you are not in a hurry take the bus  nice views
daegu,thx
daegu,dec 5
daegu,thx
daegu,yes i go there alone
daegu,nice we are 20 people from work going there from sweden
daegu,im a student from hk im worried that some of the  exhibition are too difficult for me hope i do enough preparation to understand
daegu,"ive been working with 3d since 94 and many talks are way over my head  

many technical talks are about technology that will be incorporated in mainstream software in a couple of years others are very specialized to only solve one problem in one production and aint really useful in other production 

some talks are more a broad presentation of how they made for example the waterfall in black panther others go deep in the math behind a specific shader 

there will be something for everyone and even if you dont understand everything you will enjoy yourself"
daegu,trip report second and final week

daegu,its beautiful and a shame we didnt have more than the morning to spare for a visit
daegu,its in busan museum  for koreans its possible to book via their website we just stopped by one day earlier and reserved right there we tried calling them but no one picked up the phone so going there in person was the only possibility for foreigners
daegu,thank you  and enjoy im sure youll have a great time
daegu,thats the woljeonggyo bridge in gyeongju
daegu,thanks a super cheap canon i think its the 1300d and my phone pixel 6a usually i also used my dji mini se 2 a few times
daegu,yes of course we left the car many times at the hotel because we didnt want to bother with looking for parking their public transportation was just as good as in seoul and you can simply use your tmoney card
daegu,oh no we will miss it 
daegu,sorry where is the 4th picture mountain view taken would love to take a hike too
daegu,oh nice thank u ill be going there soon
daegu,4th through 6th photos are on saryangdo  you have to take the ferry from tongyeong  is the port to get there and then take the bus to the other end of the island the bus driver already knew where to drop us off its the most known hike on the island
daegu,have fun
daegu,a guide to koreas trains from a guy who really like trains
daegu,op just want to say this is a top quality post posts like this are why i come to reddit this will be very useful next time we visit korea particularly as the last time we were there it was 2001 and there were far fewer train options we took the midnight crazy bus chain smoking driver speeds seemingly approaching 150kph slaloming all over the highway from seoul to busan thanks for sharing your wisdom
daegu,"i love the map on 2

about 8 years ago i saw this map in gangneung station iirc i asked the dude if he had extras and if i could have a copy he said okay sure went to the back and never came back lol   

anyways top 5 posts ive ever seen on here ill find a way to add it somewhere"
daegu,"thanks for the comprehensive writeup always nice to see aficionados writing articles as they are full of details

anyway also wanted to seek your opinion if i want to get to busan from incheon airport should i take ktx from gwangmyeong or seoul cant seem to find much difference other than it being faster from gwangmyeong although it has less frequent ktx trains"
daegu,this is an awesome post op have saved it so i can revisit thank you
daegu,this is so cool thanks for compiling all this info trains are so fascinating
daegu,for the joined trains during rush hour how can you tell if it is a joined train and how do you distinguish which part of the train you go on for example if my ticket says 55a is there only one car 5 to go onto
daegu,"this is such a good post  
im taking the mugunghwa train from busan to seoul exactly for the views and also so ican just read for a few hours in peace lol  
im taking my luggage with me is it easy and safe to store the luggage inside the train how does it work"
daegu,"are transfers complex for people not speaking at all korean language 
im looking at a way from seoul to daecheon with transfer at asan of 12min is is really sufficient  or too just "
daegu,this is such a great post i have a question i am taking the itx from busan to cheonan does the itx leave from busan station like the ktx and srt or does it leave from a different station i got my tickets off the korail app and it just says busan
daegu,i was watching a video of ktx and thought to myself wow it looks a lot like acela and frances tgv mostly because i guess like acela ktx was based on tgv now i know for sure haha little disappointing since i feel like the train set fronts arent narrow or sleek enough but tgv is an older but proven design im sure unlike america though  of koreas rail the high speed train sets are running are electrified
daegu,nuriro
daegu,would be interesting to see what you have to say about ktxcheongryong 
daegu,small addendum as far as electrical and usb sockets and as well as wireless phone charging goes  check this articlehttpskorearailwaycomenrechargingserviceattrainstationsandtrains out
daegu,hi great post learned a lot through this but still have some doubts i have upcoming trip end oct and from icn airport i plan to go directly to daejeon i understand tix are available from one month of the intended date and may most of the time gets sold out i see tickets for 05oct morning already ran out so i have tried booking ticket online and via app just to prepare how to proceed when it is already a month from my travel date however on reservation it is asking me a password do i just input the password i want or do i need to make my own account but i also read it needs a korean phone number which i will not have until i arrive in south korea hope you can provide help thanks in advance
daegu,"when you reserve ktx tickets on letskorailcomhttpletskorailcom  is the reservation valid for the specified time only or the entire day like in some western european countries  
my flight will land at 9am on a friday at icn airport clear immigration then shuttle bus 6770 to gwangmyeong i could add 2 hours of buffer but that potentially means waiting for 2 hours at gwangmyeong station

also from gwangmyeong to busan which is a better experience ktx or ktxsancheon assuming timing is good"
daegu,"would i experience the 260305 kph of ktx train if im just heading to suwon station from seoul station the trip is 30 minutes there will be one stop in between

but i also checked the cheaper expressitx trains and i suppose slower but the travel time is just also 30 mins same as the ktx

i also checked the ktx going to daejeon from seoul without stop in between which only takes one hour while the expressitx trains with some stops in between take almost 2 hours"
daegu,"hi super awesome post 

to clarify is the ktxchungyong you mentioned here the same as ktxcheongryong thank you in advance"
daegu,"how many stations are they going to rename 


singyeongju to gyeongju  that will teach me to use an old map



i also messed up by buying a ticket to daegu instead of dongdaegu  but it helped because my hotel was in waegwan lol


what im saying is hotels need to better describe which stations to take to get there and hotel sites confusingly list hotels two cities over"

daegu,what ever happened to the proposed hemu
daegu,whats the best way to get from jeonju to busan
daegu,"are there decreased trains during public holiday periods my partner and i are visiting korea for a holidayfamily trip in december how far in advance do you recommend train tickets should be booked

we are going 
seoul  jeonju
jeonju  busan 
busan  seoul"
daegu,quick question from a first time traveller to korea is there any need to prebook train tickets talking for example ktx from seoul to busan can we just go to the station whenever and buy a ticket for lets say the next hour or should this be done a few days in advance for economy or standing not first class
daegu,"as a foreigner ive been trying to buy korail tickets on letskorail with foreign issued visa card and a master card but the 3d secure  has been blocking the transactions despite being on the phone for 30 minutes each with visa and mastercard 

when i go and buy the tickets in person at the kiosk how far ahead am i able to buy the tickets ive heard that in person at the kiosk i can only buy tickets no more than 4 days ahead is that accurate

thank you for your detailed post about the trains"
daegu,"is the rail ninja website legitimate in getting ktx tickets planning to travel from seoul to busan busan to gyeongju via bus and gyeongju back to seoul 

i dont have large intercity rail where im from so how much time should i set aside to move around in seoul station check in is that a thing and board the train"
daegu,thank you for the very helpful post it states that for ktx you can only choose your seats as a foreigner if you book in person  i am trying to book first class seats where my mum and i can be seated next to each other so i should wait till i get to korea or it will randomly assign us if i book online we arrive in korea only about 6 days before we need the train to busan so im just concerned about things selling out as busan is going to be busy for the bts concert  what do you recommend thank you 
daegu,"i saw your post said group purchase of ktx tickets on the computer shows a page that tells you to contact korail on the phone but when im on the korail website now it seems like i can go all the way to checkout as a foreigner when trying to buy 2 tickets and they are seating the two next to each other i havent actually bought the tickets

anyway my question is im going to buy tickets for the 505am ktx seoul to pohang i dont want to be late so i want to get to the station early but is the seoul ktx station closed before that when does it open every morning"
daegu,"ive bought a 2day korail pass can i do something like this

day 1

cheongnyangni station to gapyeong station standing

gapyeong station to cheongnyangni station standing

seoul to busan seated

day 2

busan to seoul seated

x200b

i understand that for the seated tickets reservations have to be made

for the standing tickets do i also have to make reservations or can i just get on the train with my korail pass"
daegu,thank you for this detailed post im hoping you can answer this question as i have looked everywhere for an answer but i am at a loss i am a foreigner and i just purchased a korail flexible pass online i have a child under 6 but i want to get him his own seat but when i enter his birthday it doesnt allow me to purchase the pass for him because he is under 6 but i want to buy the korail pass and reserve tickets in advance so we can sit together i havent yet arrived in korea so i cant go to a ticket counter in person if i go ahead and use an incorrect birth year so i can buy his pass online do the attendants check details like that great post thanks again
daegu,dont forget the new eum320 that launched a few months ago with a top service speed of 200 mph
daegu,"you are allowed to buy tickets from one month before departure

i dont get it do i have to buy tickets more than a month prior to the departure or are tickets available only for a month prior to the departure"
daegu,hiis there a discounted pass for those travelling often between seoul and busan for example
daegu,actually im planning on going from seoul to pohang for sightseeing for a day or 2 and afterward departing from pohang to busan to stay at busan for a few days before going back to seoul for some sightseeing again before preparing to get back to incheon airport to take my flight to depart from korea however it seems that there is no ktx from pohang to busan so im wondering if there is any way to get to busan from pohang and also through the ktx map am i right to say that ill have to get down to change at singyeongju station to get to pohang station from seoul station thank you
daegu,"hi  i was gonna book ktx seoul to busan 9 dec but morning trains after my flight are all sold out can i just go to the counter to get standing ticket or standing tickets are limited
i saw the korean version of the app where we can be on waiting list or buy standing ticket but i cant make an account because i have no korean number 
i googled and saw an article mentioning to just get into the train standing  mention to the assistant that i want to get a ticket on the spot is that really doable 
thank you in advance "
daegu,thank you and that sounds like a wild night
daegu,when i was at gangneung station last month i heard he was still looking s
daegu,thank you i saw quite a few train related question on this sub lately maybe this will help
daegu,"if you have lots of luggage or have someone who has difficulty moving take the airport shuttle to gwangmyeong takes about hour if i remember correctly

if not take the direct arex to seoul station takes about 50 minutes

shuttle is a bit more expensive but has shorter transit time but youre right gwangmyeong has less frequent ktx trains

while arex has longer transit times between arex and ktx around 15 minutes depending on which platform ktx is but its easier to plan your trip and more frequent cheaper as well and all ktx trains stop at seoul station so more options"
daegu,the one in front has car number 18 the one in behind has 916 so theres only one car 5 but which one is the front may be confusing so always check before you get on
daegu,"theres no dedicated spot for luggage for mugunghwa except for overhead space that has space for typical carry on baggage on a airplane for larger luggage if you sit on the way back or very front of the car you might be able to squeeze in your luggage at the extra space

or you can put it between coach cars but either you keep an eye on it or it will be left unattended"
daegu,"not at all i assume transfer at asan is between mugunghwamaum or itx and ktx or srt

because the the latter stops at cheonanasan station while youre heading to asan station these two stations are connected they act more like separate platforms rather than separate stations

once you get off at asan if you look around on platforms you should see sign saying this way for ktx or srtalso written in english follow that

15 minute rule is to give enough buffer between transfers although youre at 12 min seoulasan is too short for trains to accumulate significant delays should be 2 minutes at most likely none at all

overall im not too worried about it and youll be fine"
daegu,if it says busan station its referring to busan station and not other stations within busan itx also leaves from some other stations in busan such as gupo station but in your case its busan station
daegu,"not just hsr almost entire rail network of korea is electrified and those that arent are planned for electrification

recently theyve been pumping money into rail infrastructure between mokposouthwest end and busan southeast end which really makes sense and makes me wonder why havent we done this before

on the amtrak note i feel like acela is a missed opportunity what amtrak really needs is a dedicated passenger rail network"
daegu,never rode on one i mean its newer than mugunghwa it was imported from japan was considered a replacement for mugunghwa never went through due to high budget so only few trains are in service
daegu,"yes you create a password when booking this is used to confirm that its you if you need to modify your reservation

  
i dont believe it asks for a phone number are you on the official app korailtalk"
daegu,"the ticket is valid for that train only if you get on a different train time it cannot be used

  
sancheon is newer so better but difference in minimal that i would get on whichever works for your schedule"
daegu,"no ktx trains that makes a stop at suwon runs on the normal rail until daejeon hence the same travel time

however daejeon and seoul is connected via high speed rail so its much faster connecting suwon to high speed rail is underway but it will take few years"
daegu,yup same thing think i made a huge set of typos
daegu,"no clue but this station takes the cake of being the weirdest

httpsenwikipediaorgwikigwaebeoprenecitestationhttpsenwikipediaorgwikigwaebeoprenecitestation"
daegu,"im looking for to book a seat online on the korail website for a train ride on december 28 but its kept showing no trains is it opened for advance booking during new year holidays 

im also planning to take ktx train from busan to seoul on new year eve in worst case that all seats are fully booked can i still get a standing ticket do i need to get to the ticket booth for the ticket i wont buy a korail pass will it also become fully booked 

x200b

thank you so much for your great article"
daegu,"he mu is still around but it was a prototype at best ktxeum is actually based on hemu

theres another ktx currently in production which hasnt been named yet based on hemu top speed of 320km should be out around 2025

hemu was definitely something to be hyped for to bad there isnt a track in korea that could support 421km per hour"
daegu,"there are no trains that connect jeonju to busan directly

by train youll have to first go to dajun or osong and transfer to trains that go to busan

alternatvely you can use the intercity bus from jeonju to busan busan is a big city with about 5 bus terminals some of which are located in outskirts of the city if youre taking the bus make sure your destination bus terminal puts you close the where you want to go in busan

taking the intercity bus is cheaper and faster unless youre using railpass"
daegu,"holidays dont really cause decreased amount of trains in fact theres a possibility that there will be even more trains planned to upkeep with the demand however if it is long distance trip or if it is a holiday with a very high demand for trainslunar new year chuseok tickets may be sold out for this reason i recommend booking your trains between one month1week before the trip

seouljeonju is connected by ktx i would also check the timetable for yongsanjeonju as some ktx depart from yongsan and yongsan is right next to seoul station

for jeonjubusan no direct train routes are available youll have to transit at osong if you want to use trainsktx unless you plan on using railpass intercity bus between two cities are better busan has 5 intercity bus terminals so check the destination bus terminal if it gets you close to where you want to go

busanseoul is connected by gyeongbu highspeed railway with ktx and srt timetables filled with them keep in mind srt doesnt take railpass"
daegu,"99 of time you could get your hands on standing tickets they are only sold on station though but if it is seoulbusan youll spend a lot time standing

economy seats for long distance trips could be sold out by that time it might not but i wouldnt risk that get your tickets at least one week before departure to get a seating ticket"
daegu,"3d authentication is commonly asked question on this sub however noone figured out how to solve it yet it happens completely randomly and card companies says the card is fine

the card in question works fine in korea it only happens on online purchase try with yet another  card for online payment

as far as i know it is up to one month before train departure korail homepage says so"
daegu,"i seen lots of people shittalk rail ninja anyway official site is httpswwwletskorailcom

language selection is on top right

or you can use the offical app korailtalk both of them support english

time it takes to board a train depends on how fast you can find that train theres no check in make sure youre on the right train if youre on the app it tells you which platform it is 15 minutes before departure or you can look at screen on station theres a lot of trains leaving for similar station at similar time so make sure

they dont even check your tickets as long as youre in the correct seat"
daegu,"i tested it out after seeing your comment you are unable to choose your seats even in first class and when you try to purchase multiple tickets using computer it says to call korail to purchase tickets

however booking tickets using the korail appkorailtalk gave me better results while i was only able to choose whether i want to go with economy or first class it seems that the system tries to book seats next to each other when you tried to purchase tickets as a group and it led me to checkout page immediately while you are unable to choose which first class seats youll take you are still able to sit together

editing my post based on this"
daegu,"ah they mustve changed it

technically seoul station is open 24hours but some parts of it close when there are no trains

i found that they start operating again at 4 and the fast food place inside seoul station opens at 4 as well

so anytime after 4am should be fine"
daegu,having the same question about the standing tickets myself
daegu,"im gonna go with no they dont check for peoples age unless they clearly see an adult sitting with a child ticket

however the reason why your child isnt allowed to get railpass is because children under 6 ride free but i dont know how seat reservations work for them i think you have to ask korail directly if you can they got their number on the railpass purchase site"
daegu,"tickets are available on one month before departure up until train leaves the station

for example trains leaving on october 15th will sell their tickets starting on september 15th you can buy tickets for that train as long as its not sold out"
daegu,"the only pass available to foreigners is the railpass otherwise i havent heard of any other deals these passes save you a ton of cost if youre planning to make frequent trips by trains

compared to trains in other countries koreas trains are on the cheaper side even high speed ones you should be okay"
daegu,"it is easier to take the intercity bus between pohangbusan because trains require transfer and dongdaegueast daegu station or singyeongju however theres a mugunghwa that runs between pohang station and bujeonone of busans stations that doesnt need a transfer but this one leaves at 555 am from pohang

for seoulpohang ktx from seoul to pohang runs frequently without transfer srt which departs from suseo only has twice a day"
daegu,"standing tickets are limited but it is super rare to see them getting filled up

the article you saw is mentioning about extension tickets done in similar fashion to what i wrote on how to get srt standing tickets its doable you buy the standing tickets and ask the conductor if there is any portion you can be seated then you pay for the seating ticket if theres an empty seat

youll have to purchase standing tickets at the station but keep checking the websiteapp because last minute cancellation are really common if you see a spot take it if nothing comes up purchase your standing ticketseoulbusan and ask the conductor if you can purchase a seat at least the partial of the way"
daegu,i see does the outside of each train car have the car number labeled
daegu,thanks ill get there early and try for a backfront seat 
daegu,awesome thank you so much
daegu,"i just saw ktxs newest trainsets are all emus really nice i prefer that style over the french push pull style 

i think brightline and cahsr are going to prove the dedicated passenger rail concept in us but god only knows if they can get some sort of dedicated tracks for the nec in america itd be really nice if they could but i suspect even with private dedicated rail the nec will still be shared with the freight companies and still not be fully electrified"
daegu,"hi thanks for clarifying  

password  i understand now i thought i need to have an account to have the password to be entered

phone number  i did not proceed yet as it is not yet a month from my travel date only mocked book on a same day and stopped at passenger information however i was referring to phone number being asked when making an account which i thought is needed to have a password 

all clarified for now might come back if i encounter something
thank you again"
daegu,"i think youve accidently replied to automod
anyway trains after dec 28 including 28th isnt appearing because theyre apparently going through rescheduling they say the booking will be open at a later date which is odd because korail usually tells when it will be open when they make such announcements my reccomendation is to check once a day if it has opened or not

youll be likely to get a standing ticket in case the seating is full they can be purchased on the ticket booth but you can buy standing tickets in advance as well"
daegu,thank you for this insight 
daegu,thank you this was very helpful
daegu,"thanks for the reply op ive read a few different threads across different subs lots of people trying to buy from online retailers tickets figurines makeup etc on how to get pass the 3d secure but yes it seems pretty hopeless at this point 

ill buy my train tickets when i am in korea im just worried that the tickets will be sold out since it will be a heavier travel time bts and black pink concerts are happening does korail add additional trains  schedules to manage anticipated influx of travelers or should i expect the tickets to sell out if i dont secure them a month ahead thanks op"
daegu,"thanks very much for helping me look further into this is the app in korean and once youve booked on the app does it show you your seats i dont know if its worth booking first class if we cant even choose our seats

i guess either i risk getting poor seats by booking ahead of time or i try to book them once in seoul about a week before and then it sounds like we could choose seats together"
daegu,awesome thank you i have looked everywhere to find that info and its been nowhere i can find in english anyway
daegu,thanks for your invaluable input
daegu,thank you for your reply
daegu,yup if not sure ask the conductors at the platform
daegu,although i do believe it is safe to storage larger luggage ob the train right
daegu,oh my mistake thank you for your notification and information is there any chance the standing tickets will be sold out too  i need to get from busan to seoul on new years eve as ive already booked a hotel room on that day now a bit afraid not be able to catch a train to seoul can i buy the standing tickets on the same website too is it under the same process as reserving a seat on the train
daegu,cant really say for sure heard busan was looking into getting more transportation to the city dont know they actually did or not if they sell out youll have to use mix between seating and standing tickets
daegu,"you are able to switch language to english on the app it shows you the seat number just before the checkout you could look at the ktx seat map like this

httpskorearailwaycomeca28cec849debb0b0ecb998eb8f84ktxec82b0ecb29caed8380ec9e85httpskorearailwaycomeca28cec849debb0b0ecb998eb8f84ktxec82b0ecb29caed8380ec9e85

to find which seat it is checked the app again and it tries to make group sit together in economy as well"
daegu,do you also know which entrance of seoul station is the best for finding the ktx train im not sure where to tell my taxi driver to drop me off
daegu,yeah its really rare to see something get stolen especially when it clearly belongs to someone btw you can book ahead on letskorail and guarantee yourself a front and back seati recommend back
daegu,"standing tickets are sold when sitting tickets are sold out and has 1020 of the ktxs seating capacity 1020 are a lot when it comes to 9 cars18 if theyre running multi trains and if one train is sold out there are plenty of other trains in the incredible instance all ktx trains are out of standing tickets itx40 mugunghwa100 have much larger standing ticket capacity i wouldnt worry about it

theyre only sold on stationmost of the time and has no designated seat on the ticket there are two seats between coach cars and these are intended for standing tickets whoever sits there first takes it

since standing tickets dont show up in the conductors ticket system theyll ask you to present your ticket after every stop so if you get a standing ticket make sure to have your ticket readily available"
daegu,thanks so much as long as i can see the seats before checkout then i know if theyre together and if not i wont buy ill check it out and update here  thank you
daegu,sorry another question does the train number matter is first class in some better than others thanks
daegu,honestly taxi drivers will know better than me just say seoul station and theyll land you in a reasonable spot
daegu,"i booked ahead but didnt see where to choose my seat i must have missed it but thats ok  
youre being an amazing help so sorry to bother you again but i have one more question im thinking of arrived at least 30 minutes before the departure time should i arrive even earlier or even 30 minutes is too much"
daegu,oh thank you so much for such a complete piece of information im new to ktx reservation system and all kinds of things relating to korea  now i can plan and know what my plan or even plan b are your post and replies have helped us a lot 
daegu,sorry i have one more question for you to help on i might need to book a seat on srt trains for busan to singyeongju i wont buy the korail pass this time so i guess i dont need to limit my choice only for ktx  could you please guide me the official website for booking seat on srt trains  ive heard that some are of agencies and they do charge a lot extra thank you for your help
daegu,it could mean differnce between orignal ktx and ktx sancheon however first class has same standard accross ktx so if you plan to ride on first class theres no difference in economy seats however ktx sancheon is recently builtcompared to orignal ktx so it has slightly better seats in economy however ive heard people describe ktx economy as slightly tight but not uncomfortableeven on the orignal
daegu,"oh no i forgot english website doesnt support seat selection your ticket should have randomly assigned seat on it the front and back seats sell out pretty quick but you should be able to squeeze a luggage behind a very back seat i also heard some of the newer models of mugunghwa do have luggage space between cars but this is hit or miss you never know which type of car is your seat on

  
you could arrive 5 minutes before obviously dont recommend because cutting it close is never great and still get on general rule is 15 minutes theres no checkin procedure or anything find your platform double check youre on correct platform get on when train arrives they dont even check your tickets unless youre in a wrong seat"
daegu,"httpsetksrailkrmaindolanguageenhttpsetksrailkrmaindolanguageen

this is the official site for srt tickets in english"
daegu,darn it was working perfectly and put us in seats right next to each other in first class and then when i put in all my payment info to process i got an error code  do think this is to do with the credit card i could try again with a different one but just want to make sure it didnt charge me somehow already
daegu,thank you so much 
daegu,thank you so much for your informative post  amazing  i love trains as well my grandfather designed them  planning a rail journey from seoul to busan central and then busan central to incheon next month  your op was from 2 years ago  any strong recommendation on ktx vs srt to central busan station  does it matter most where in seoul you leave from  and can i take both from busan central to incheon  would be a family of four in first class  thank you again op
daegu,thanks a lot
daegu,it you dont receive confirmation email or something similar its highly unlikely that the payment has gone through try with a different card
daegu,"hi again unless youre specifically going for the new model of ktx that started to operate earlier this month ktx and srt are the same it just matters where in seoul youre leaving from  if youre using railpass since srt doesnt have one

while high speed rails to incheon is under construction theyre nowhere near completion youll have to get off at gwangmyeong or seoul station to get to incheon"
daegu,update had to try with 4 different cards banks and finally it went through success thanks for your help i was able to see the seats and everything 
daegu,good to know thanks so there is no train that goes from busan to incheon without switching trains    obv easier to stay on the same train with luggage etc   wonder if that switching is enough of a hassle to just get off the train at seoul station and take a taxi 
daegu,glad it worked out in the end have a great time at the concert
daegu,can someone enlighten me about daegu andor daejeon
daegu,"both are nice cities but i recommend going to gyeongju or jeonju instead if this is your first time in korea both are historic cities with many important cultural heritages daejeon and daegu grew as a transportation hub during the early 20th century after the construction of the train

daejeon became a technologyresearch hub during 70s and 80s thats why national science museum is famous there another famous attraction is sungsimdang a large bakery that only sells in daejeon it is so famous and successful that tourists from other cities come to daejeon just because of the bread 

daegu is famous for its central downtown named dongseongro i went there once and it was so energetic and vibrant comparable to the streets in seoul also daegu is where the founder of samsung started his company so theres an interesting park at their initial factory site"
daegu,as someone thats lived in daegu for close to a decade now i personally recommend it lots of fun things to do
daegu,daejeon seongsimdang is famous
daegu,"the people who live in daejeon selfmock daejeon has no funny thing but have sungsimdang bakery 
actually i cant say daejeon has its own food or goto  place but if you visit there you can go some cafes and famous restaurant and you can feel sk not as tourist attraction but as residential area"
daegu,i am with others who have suggested gyeongju very cool historical city check out bulguska temple seokgurum grotto donggung palace and wolji pond and the tombs just a lot to see and learn about here i was there a couple weeks ago again and i have always enjoyed the area
daegu,imho both are livable fine downs but nothing terrible exciting for travelers i used to live in daejeon and was like hmmm lets go somewhere else when someone visited me theres at least 5 cooler towns than either off the top of my head gwangju jeonju kongju andong gangneung sokcho suncheon yeosu jeju seogwipo
daegu,highly recommend you spend 2 nights in andong 
daegu,i did a quick day trip from seoul to daejeon during my trip  agree theres not necessarily any sites to see but i did find quite a few cute cafes and it was interesting to see a different city i wish i had a little more time to wonder along the river etc i also think its a university town which is kind of fun if you do have some extra time in your itinerary it could be fun to just visit for a day for a different experience
daegu,"hey friend how was andong we will leave gyeongju tomorrow for the jinju lantern festival but still have a couple of unassigned days before getting back 

for reference we really enjoyed seoul and busan and getting a feel of the tourist  not so touristic in busan districts and actually watching the locals go about their business and their norabang 

gyeongju is a very nice place for a stroll and soaking up the landscape but we definitely dont want to visit any more temples recreations i think weve got that completely checked down by now back home ive got a roman lighthouse from the ii century in my hometown neighborhood and 5 gothic cathedrals in a 200 mile radius so o think our monumental references are expectations are a bit different 
no disrespect at all we think wed rather enjoy better mingling around with people and earring the delicious food please give us more food destinations"
daegu,"skip them and go somewhere like gyeongju andong or east coast cities like gangneung or sokcho 

daegu and daejeon wont feel one bit different from any other seoul city neighborhood overall"
daegu,any massage in daegu that has extra service
daegu,daegu also known as gotham is considered the most bacward politicallyincorrect hicktown amongst the locals daejeon while known as a boring city to visit is quite charming and slowpaced
daegu,does the bakery have a location at the train station in daejeon was there recently for a wedding and almost every single person had the same bag looked like from a bakery
daegu,ah yeah thank you maybe ill hit up daegu for a short time after seoul go onto gyeongju and then finish up in busan appreciate the insight 
daegu,good to know and glad to hear leaning towards leaving out daejeon and visiting daegu before going on to gyeongju 
daegu,hey man i arrive in daegu later today got any recommendations
daegu,ooo looks great
daegu,thanks for that i do enjoy visiting places without much to do exactly and just soaking up the local life so maybe it would suit me nicely 
daegu,cheers think its definitely gonna slide into the itinerary based on what ive heard
daegu,weve actually just snuck andong into our itinerary for a few nights so im glad to hear you got any specific recommendations for when there by chance
daegu,"seoga sundubu  soft tofu stew

andong jjang dumplings  loved this dumpling spot their set meals were great value and some of the best dumplings we had in korea

mammoth bakery  very popular bakery spot famous for their cream cheese bread thought it was just okay but got lots of other nice bits 

andong brewing publichouse  im big on my craft beer and they had lots of their own brews and others from across south korea also had a nonalcoholic craft beer had a pizza here too which was decent but nothing crazy

midrange  never got in here but popular cafe and desserts in an old hanok

enjoyed andong a fair bit parts of the town are a bit uninspiring but there are some very nice pockets i would still recommend going to the hahoe folk village as its not got the same vibe as visiting templesmuseums etc and its an interesting and quaint little place can get there on the bus very easily"
daegu,"this

also gangneung  great hiking"
daegu,yes they do it is really tasty and good for value so many train riders visit their store
daegu,if possible i recommend to rent a car lots of places that are absolutely stunning and getting there would make it a whole lot easier to get to with a car
daegu,what do you like to do
daegu,it tastes good but the price is really reasonable
daegu,"oh right daejeon has government complex daejeon so if you go restaurant around it to eat dinner many of people just finished work and drink soju for exmaple 
it might be speical experience"
daegu,thanks a lot my girlfriend really wants to try jjang
daegu,not possible unfortunately
daegu,enjoy galleries museums any cafe or restaurant recommendations would be greatly appreciated too
daegu,if youre american and not already in south korea you can walk in and out of aaa with a international drivers permit in 30 minutes id recommend it if its an option
daegu,"busy day sorry for the late response 

if you go to banwoldang station  

then go to the south end of it exit 9 and take the first right
pretty cafes in that area with some art galleries 
my favorite is deep coffee roasters 

there is my favorite cafe in all of daegu called  
it is more on the expensive side and a bit far but no regrets going there its a coffee wine bar and they built it themselves personally know the owner and theyre great and very knowledgeable about what they sell 

i also recommend 
shares great history about daegu 

 is also a greaat little place in the evening to go to and rest at the mart in the middle of the park and have a drink if youre into that  

famous dumpling places i recommend it  directly in downtown

if you go down the road of 2 13 theres a bunch of good  restaurants to go too across the street from the fire department 


i quickly just wrote it up but if youre looking for anything else lmk"
daegu,neither of us can drive 
daegu,than you very much mate ill make good use of the recommendations 
daegu,oh well thats definitely a no go then hope you have fun
daegu,thanks now weve started getting a plan together we cant wait
daegu,travelling to korea tips on how to manage my time
daegu,"you should book your accoms before the trip many places especially in more convenient  popular locations are booked up well ahead of time

with your budget i think its almost impossible to get a hotel unless at inconvenient locations youll have to look at airbnbs hostels shared dorms etc

you can check on bookingcom or expedia for a sense of the pricing of accoms"
daegu,"to be honest 350 cad for 4 days including hotels transport food and activities sounds pretty tight even if you stay in hostel dorms accommodation is going to be at least 120 cad for 4 nights do you have to pay for transportation from incheon to daegu and daegu to seoul yourself if yes thatll at least be another 45 cad then if you want to spend money on nothing but food and maybe the occasional subway ride thatll be at least another 120 cad 

if youd like a single room and a few activities definitely up your budget a little definitely book hotels in advance the cheapest single hotel room i can currently find in seoul for the dates you want to go is 180 cad for 2 nights usually you can get that cheaper but it seems to be very sold out"
daegu,i recommend you to make a reservation first because good and popular accommodation will be removed quickly i think you can find it on korean apps like yanolja or agoda
daegu,"how late is late night clearly you wont make the direct icntae feeder flight at 1935 even if you fly in on skyteam but you wont find budgetfriendly options if any in the immediate vicinity of incheon airport either on t1 side or t2 side perhaps unseo area around the metro station of the same name which is the airport town so to speak might offer wider options

otherwise you bring yourself to seoul proper and preposition yourself somewhere near seoul station for an easier trip to daegu the next morning getting to seoul station from icn is absolutely possible on an airport limousine bus coach even during the odd hours of the night"
daegu,airbnb is cheaper i got a 29 bucks a night in hongdae small studio type with full kitchen and private bath and small refrigerator i had to book this early because of high competiton hotel is too overprice for me since mostly we just need a 6 hours of sleep
daegu,airbnbs are almost all illegal keep that in mind book a hotel
daegu,i found a hotel for 3850 yen a night through peach airlines when i booked my flight
daegu,late would be 940 pm when my flight lands im assuming ill be another 3545 mins at the airport before i exit security and baggage claim and whatnot
daegu,"airbnbs are almost

all illegal keep that in

mind book a hotel

 gwangjuguy



i detect haikus and sometimes successfully learn32more32about32mehttpswwwredditcomrhaikusbot

opt out of replies haikusbot opt out  delete my comment haikusbot delete"
daegu,"good for you but was that in japan cos this is about korea 

also im not saying its impossible to find cheap hotels its just difficult if op wants to maximise their time and not stay in poorly located or inconvenient hotels 

the popularconvenient areas tend to be more expensive and booked up early i usually have to travel to seoul with only about a months notice and its always difficult to find affordable accoms that meet my standard and are available and my budget is higher than ops"
daegu,"from t1 the last three runs of 6001 toward seoul station are at 2230 2250 2310

then theres n6701 at 2350 with the dropoff one block northeast of seoul station and then theres the first run of n6001 to seoul station transit center at 0020

not that accommodation options around seoul station are necessarily and compellingly better than what you will find around the airportunseo area but at least transportation is less of an issue in your decisionmaking"
daegu,bless you
daegu,no in korea not sure if its because i am currently in japan that the prices are popping up as yen  its currently being discounted from 5500 yen  httpsroomsflypeachcomho2129150912pa5qcheckout20241114tabdescriptionqroom0adults2ygf14qcheckin20241106mgt7woe4wod3zsx0sye3qroom0children0httpsroomsflypeachcomho2129150912pa5qcheckout20241114tabdescriptionqroom0adults2ygf14qcheckin20241106mgt7woe4wod3zsx0sye3qroom0children0
daegu,thats a good price but its also in incheon so its actually pretty far from the usual tourist areas like gangnam myeongdong hongdae etc
daegu,i was just gonna take the public transport to the mentioned areas how about this one httpsroomsflypeachcomho2129162816pa3qcheckout20241114tabdescriptionqroom0adults2ygf14qcheckin20241106mgt7woe4wod3zsx0sye3qroom0children0httpsroomsflypeachcomho2129162816pa3qcheckout20241114tabdescriptionqroom0adults2ygf14qcheckin20241106mgt7woe4wod3zsx0sye3qroom0children0
daegu,"incheon is fine if you dont mind the travel time im basically in seoul to attend concerts over the weekends so convenience is a lot more important to me

im afraid i cant offer much advice on whether certain accoms are good or not  id just say maybe plan a bit about what you want to do or see then use naverkakao maps to see if the travel times and all are ok for you"
daegu,45k for a month
daegu,"ill actually be going to korea for a month myself in a few months from what i have found people generally said 80000 won to 100000 won a day is what you should be spending however food and public transport is so cheap in korea that i cant see how anyone can spend that much unless theyre doing a lot of shopping and a lot of activities each day ultimately theres no fixed amount you need to have to enjoy your time in korea people can spend a lot in korea while others can spend a lot less it depends on many factors 

where youre staying places in hongdae are a lot more expensive than in other areas if youre willing to stay outside the tourist spots but near a bus stop or a train station you can save a lot thats what ill be doing 

it also depends on what type of accommodation you will be staying in if youre in a hostel you will likely be eating out every night and day but it can be cheap to eat out in korea however ill be renting an airbnb and cooking to save money as well be careful though from what my korean friends have told me grocery shopping can be expensive as well in terms of price hostels are obviously the cheapest way to go ive heard that airbnbs and hotels in seoul are almost the same price but from what i have seen hotels are still quite a bit more expensive 

it also depends on your activities it looks like youre going to do quite a bit of traveling so you need to be aware that days like that is where you will likely spend most of your money but plan ahead and buses and trains are really quite cheap ill be taking day trips from busan to gyeongju etc and its only going to cost me like 8 for a bus there 

personally ive budgeted around 5000 for my trip and im expecting accomodation to take at least half of that but ill be spending it on airbnbs and a hotel at the end of my trip if you to stay in a room or a hostel you would save so much money my spending budget will then be around 2500 besides some clothes shopping i think i wont spend much at all either way i believe your trip is entirely made up on your budget you will know what you can or cannot do when youre there but you have more than enough money if you want to visit korea thats for sure"
daegu,"that is more than enough especially if it doesnt include flight 
you can get an airbnd for around 500 or 600 for a month 
get an unlimited seoul transportation pass for around 50  best deals is from lotte mart at seoul station after 7 pm they have 3040 off on their made meals like chicken or other dishes 
for around 5 after discount
restaurants you are looking at 610 per meal

your other biggest expense will be traveling to far places like busan especially if you dont plan it right and get it almost a few days before departure around 40 to 80 one way fast train 

but if you look at it youll spend around 900 for eating out 3 times everyday and accommodation cost you around 600 thats 1500 total the rest is for transportation outside of seoul"
daegu,you can save even more money by staying in a goshiwon but everything is super cheap by western standards
daegu,my wife and i come over every two years last time we stayed for all of october 2022 that amount should be fine depending on what accommodations you stay in as other have said food is very affordable even if you get burnt out on koream cuisine western options are equally affordable if you plan to do no shopping then you are very safe with your estimated budget
daegu,id be careful whostel or goshiwon sometimes because if u dont speak korean sometimes they overcharge you i wouldnt say this is common for anything but rentals and taxis though in certain areas airbnbs are usually a good option and there are also share houses that often provide a couple food options kimchi rice and sometimes meat living here u can spend anywhere from around 5000krw to 12000krw on a cheap meal but i also live in an expensive area so maybe its a few skewed i would say a conservative estimate for food and transportation alone would be around 600800month however this is often a student estimate and if u eat out 23 meals per day 40000krw a day maybe double that
daegu,nice i going there in apr 2025
daegu,when i used to live in korea cooking was not worth it 2017 you could get decent korean food bibimbap kimchijjiggae for 50006000 kre
daegu,thank you sooo much ill take a look at it until then if i feel financially tight i might cut out visiting other cities but ill check it carefully thanks for the help
daegu,a totally agree about cooking not being worth it i went twice last year and didnt cook at all i did put ramen cups in my room for snacks but its just cheaper to eat out
daegu,which express bus in korea
daegu,hmm i dont think korean people really care about which express bus company they use they dont believe theres much difference in the quality of the buses between companies
daegu,"there are a few companies but like the other poster said no one here cares which one they use ive ridden a few and they are all pretty much the same

there are also first class buses which i highly recommend cost isnt that much more but seats are super comfortable and reclines to 135 degrees"
daegu,"whatever fits in your time schedule

there is literally no difference in bus service you get a seat if you book early one for yourself alone if late you sit with someone else they usually dont have free wifi

during chuseok you might get stuck in traffic on the highway but thats something no bus company can avoid"
daegu,whichever you can get on
daegu,you will spend 35 times as long as it would normally take traveling by bus during chuseok  bad idea as you are giving up that day of travel  completely
daegu,"look up train tickets again tomorrow aug 22 in the afternoon and onwards there are bound to be leftovers for southbound tickets if youre starting from daegu ktxsrt or otherwise

still for future reference there is no meaningful difference between bus companies in terms of passenger experience what does make a difference is the grade of the bus you book and take  between 45seater 28seater  and 21seater  equipment each bus comes with a single grade combined with a particular departure time plus pay attention to operational patterns  if and how many intermediate stops between your origin and your destination but across different companies services of the same grade are pretty much standardized

some popular routes will have an alternating supply of different grades some routes have a uniform supply of single grade throughout the day

if youre heading directly for haeundae for example bus can be a very reasonable and efficient choice over train

but again the current booking lockout for train tickets ends tomorrow"
daegu,ok but i have no idea which ones are out there
daegu,"i know but i have no other option

what about the korail pass and enter the train and just stand in de hallway   
i saw that was possible with a pass"
daegu,"thanks for the message   
  
for the seoul  busan line general member sales hours were from 700 am to 100 pm this morning local time for me it was midnight 0000 my time  still i didnt manage to get a ticket for an hour   
  
at the time of searching there were 40000 waiting for me   
all ktx from 13 14 15 and 16 september are fully booked 

im going to try again tonight but the english version of korail does not take you to the queue to book tickets  
  
the srt website doesnt make me much wiser if you search on that website they are still talking about special booking days for holidays in januari 2018 

  
it wasnt a big deal if i wasnt traveling with a little kid but korail didnt mentioned anything last week about chuseok on the english version"
daegu,"it looks like you might need to check the express bus reservation website to find out more you can use the following site

express bus reservation sitehttpstxbusetmoneycokrotcktrmlinfentydo

i tried searching for bus routes on september 15th but i couldnt see any available options it could be because i entered the departure and destination information incorrectly or it might be due to the chuseok holiday rush "
daegu,"i found that you can actually book bus tickets on klook please try accessing the site using the link below sorry for the confusion 

book bus tickets on klookhttpswwwklookcomenusbuses341010southkoreacurrencykrwcampaignid21536796681adgroupid166457250678targetidkwd669737179098matchtypeedevicemcreative708065211066extensionidkeywordkorea20express20buslocinterestmslocphysicalms9197168networkgutmcontentcampaignid21536796681adgroupid166457250678gadsource1gclidcjwkcajwoja2bhbpeiwa0l0imltjxkd6ygc4lo4gcu67xmwsgp3ynl66j0cvzdso1y9touvcpbxboczdcqavdbwe"
daegu,"so you already have a korail membership number and login account even though you live in central europe say from your past residence in korea

that general members refers to those with korail membership account who are or at least used to be at one point residents in korea but without disability or senior priority it certainly does not mean all members of the general public from anywhere in the world hence no access is permitted through the english interface during the lockout period because random foreigners are less likely to be residents whereas resident foreigners do get exclusive access through the korean interface

the lockout will be lifted at 0800 am your time tomorrow not your tonight check back then and go from there"
daegu,ok thanks
daegu,klook is a tourist exploitation site the fees are insane
daegu,"    im back here to say that i was able to authorize tickets on september 15th thanks to you
    
    now my wife no longer has to worry about how we would get to busan with our little one
    
    for anyone who still needs tickets
    go quickly to letskorailcom"
daegu,"thanks again for your reply

no i dont have a korail membership 
ive been in korea before but not during chuseok lol
and always travel by ktx or srt

i think there is space for improvement for the korail app"
daegu,oh i see i wasnt aware of that part  i was originally going to recommend a bus app but it doesnt support english so i couldnt share it with you
daegu,itinerary shakedown  2 weeks first time in south korea
daegu,hiking in bukhansan mountain one day would be nice
daegu,daejeon is infamous for having nothing to do id recommend daegu but it can be quite hot around this time
daegu,"sokcho intercity bus terminal do operate bus ride between sokcho and busan  do you mind if i ask you if there is specific reason why you would go back to seoul and then take train to busan

add x the sky busan and haedong yonggungsa temple on your busan travel schedule its located in haeundae so you will find easy to reach

suggestion something like haedong yonggungsa temple  blue line beach train station songjungtake train  blue line beach train station mipoget off train  x the sky busan sounds reasonable route"
daegu,"i think you should cut down on seoul and busan since they are just big cities and add gyeongju which is pretty close to busan

we are still in korea and our plan looks like this we love hiking and not so keen on big cities so far our plan

 3 days in seoul there are no art galleries which is weird we love art galleries museums were also okayish but have beautiful architecture we went for some shopping but we are not big shoppers

 2 days in seoraksan you can do all 3 main one day trails in one day if you are fit enough it was really beautiful and the trails well maintained prepare to climb some stairs a lot

 3 days in gyeongju the bus from seoul is cheaper than train to busan and gyeongju is just one hour bus ride from busan very lovely small city with lots of traditional architecture we also took a public bus to gyeongju national park for a hike much less demanding than seoraksan because much lower peak the trails can be a bit slippery when going down i landed on my ass twice but i didnt bring my hiking shoes i think its off season here because so many places weve been to were empty

our future plan is
2 days in busan again we are not very keen on big cities i did some research and other than busan museum of art and gamcheon culture village nothing else caught my eye

5 days in jeju  seogwipo we want to chill on the beach a bit and then do a hardcore hike hallasan national park weve read that it takes about 8 hours to complete then we rest again and fly back to seoul for a night

most of the intercity buses can be bought in advance on klook minus one from gyeongju to busan which we bought at the machine when we arrived our transportation looks like this

seoul  sokcho by bus
sokcho  seoul  gyeongju by bus
gyeongju  busan by bus
busan  jeju by plane
jeju  seoul by plane

we have yet to take a taxi because you can buy a public transport card and top it up naver local navigation did not disappoint us so far you can almost get anywhere with public transport"
daegu,thanks it looks really nice
daegu,thanks for the tip about daejeon do you mean daegu is hot now or are you saying it will be hot in midoctober when i would potentially go there
daegu,"awesome suggestions thank you

ok i thought the sokcho to seoul to busan route didnt make sense as well but i saw several articles which were then reinforced by chat gpt that the easiest and fastest route is to go back through seoul thanks for pointing this out ill try to map out a more direct route"
daegu,thanks for sharing your itinerary ill check out things to do in gyeongju maybe as a day trip from busan that was one thing i forgot to mention in my original post we really like doing at least one day trip if we are in a city for 4 days to get a chance to see more of the country
daegu,deleted
daegu,it would definately chill down in mid october
daegu,"reserve ticket from here

httpstxbusetmoneycokrotcktrmlinfentydohttpstxbusetmoneycokrotcktrmlinfentydo"
daegu,"i didnt mean it doesnt have any it has a lot but they are small and mostly privately owned i am used to big art galleries owned or semi owned by government for example the national gallery in london or the louvre

we went to sema national museum of modern and contemporary art and dongdaemun design plaza and there was not much to see tbh maybe we had bad luck because it seemed like half of the exhibitions were closed

if you have better recommendations please share because we will be back to seoul for a day"
daegu,got it is there any reason you recommend daegu
daegu,thank you
daegu,is this a 3rd party site or something official for the tmoney card
daegu,"this site is super confusing is one of these options a tmoney card or can i actually use my nonkorean credit card

httpsimgurcomakmq4chphttpsimgurcomakmq4chp



and what would a tourist put in the resident registration number field or is it optional"
daegu,recommendations for 25 weeks in sk
daegu,"recommendations take nami island out of your itinerary its not worth it 
secondly jeju is very doable by public transport bustaxi we did jeju by bustaxi and its fine in fact its a wonderful way to actually discover the island and the locals and see everyday life in jeju ensure wherever you stay has an access to the seogwipojeju city intercity bus route and you will be good to go thirdly if you have time in seoul i heavily recommend doing namhansanseong in gyeonggi province its very doable by public transport and is a wonderful place full of history lovely hikes and wonderful food"
daegu,"gyeongju and jeonju are relatively and comparatively small and you wont need three nights to see those cities i spent two nights in jeonju a couple of months back and it was definitely one too much 

gyeongju is essentially an outdoor museum and you could easily spend three days seeing all of the complexes and museums and historical sites there but i think two days is enough the hanok village in jeonju is worth a day trip but its actually pretty commercialized so i wouldnt commit to spending more than a day there and do not stay in one of the guesthouses in the actual village complex itself  theyre overpriced and nothing special  get a motel in the city somewhere 

you could actually skip jeonju altogether and go to andong instead  its much much better 

if you do decide to go to jeonju do one night there  hanok village during the day then the night market then take the train to gunsan the following day 

i dont think daegu is worth three nights either its just another runofthemill large city last month i did two days in gwangju  it easily could have been just one day two nights at the most is sufficient for daegu   

pusan is fun and i think three nights is okay for a twoweek trip theres a lot to see and do skip the aquarium though as its really small and not worth the price of admission the night market is good graze your way through there instead of s sitdown dinner one night they will 100 have vegan fare on offer 

something else to keep in mind is doing templestays in the national and priovincial parks  they serve vegan food and you get to see some truly lovely nature theyre easy to get to via public transportation from practically all of the decentsized cities be aware that they arent cheap  some are pricier than a nice hotel but it sounds like you would enjoy trying it even for a night or two theres lots of info available online about them depending on where in the country youd like to do it 

considering that the only place in the westcentral part of the country youre thinking about visiting is jeonju maybe it might be better to scratch that of the list do andong instead and kind of stick to doing an eastsoutheast arc from seoul to pusan instead or rather the opposite way as it looks like youre planning to start in pusan and end in seoul so maybe northnortheast would be better

one option would be

start in pusan 3 nights

head up to gyeongju 2 nights

head to andong 1 or 2 nights maybe a side trip to mungyeong

head up to someplace on the coast in gangwon  donghae gangneung yangyang seokcho 2 nights

head over to seoraksan 1 night which will be beautiful that time of year it wont be a big trip from the gangwon coast 

overnight bus to seoul or to a city where you can get a bus or train to seoul 

do your 5 nights in seoul maybe do a one day trip to the incheon chinatown to the dmz or to the fortress wall in suwon

and you have one extra night to be able to insert your templestay wherever you choose 

if you decide not to do the templestay after all you might think about taking a day trip from pusan over to tongyeong or geoje         

enjoy your trip whatever you decide to do"
daegu,seoul  seodaemun prison history hall
daegu,i would get an international drivers permit httpsenwikipediaorgwikiinternationaldrivingpermitfrom your local automobile club even if you do not plan to hirerent a car for now  often came in handy for me while traveling when i wanted to change my itinerary for a place best reachable by car
daegu,"gyeongju you could definitely do 3 or 4 days   1 central area 2 bomun  tons of museums and other activities 3 namsan hiking  seoakseowon area  4 bulguksaseokugram   yangdong or east coast  would be easier with a hired car or taxi 


only down side is therd are only like 2 vegan restaurants in town


 daegu probably doesnt need more than a day or two"
daegu,stay longer in busan instead of visiting daegu theres so much to to do in busan we stayed there for almost 2 weeks and did something different everyday also gyeongju is a good day trip from busan too no need to stay overnight
daegu,thank you for this have added namhansanseong to the list good to know jeju is doable with public transport how long would you say is needed for the island in this case just wondering if it would be doable to swap daegu for jeju or if we would need more than 3n in jeju considering its a flight away
daegu,thanks for such a thorough response i will look into the places you mention and the temple stays for sure we tend to avoid having a lot of very short stops if we can as we feel like theyre a bit too much of a rush and the constant packingunpacking gets annoying would you say seoraksan is doable as a day trip from the gangwon coast or is the overnight stay there a must do also i note your spelling of pusan  is there a generally preferredmost appropriate spelling or are pusanbusan used interchangeably depending on personal preference thanks again 
daegu,unfortunately not doable for us as we arent in our home country at the moment but yes it would have been useful to have  hindsight is 2020 etc
daegu,cool thank you will look into all these good to know about the vegan restaurants we might end up skipping daegu based on the consensus here
daegu,oh wow great to know theres so much to see in busan do you have any standout activities you can recommend sounds like we will be skipping daegu
daegu,we were there in jeju for 8 days with public transport it takes a bit of time and in some of the inner places bus is a bit irregular so you can do small taxi rides to take you to a bigger bus stop
daegu,which places should i visit in korea
daegu,ill recommend you jeonju where you can see traditional houses such as hanok gangneung its by the east sea and you can take a ktx from seoul which takes around 2 hours jeju busan and gyeongju but i wouldnt recommend daegu daejeon or gwangju as there isnt much special to see also if you like going for a hike i would recommend you seoraksan and hallasanjeju
daegu,have you seen my maphttpskkotozzlu58iwjr
daegu,yeonnam in seoul is a great neighborhood imo
daegu,if you havent gotten a cycle get one you can get one second hand for less than 100000  there is so much hidden away here and there  most people dont realize how much goes on in the countryside  with the river parks you can cover a lot of ground for example you can bike all the way from bundang to inchon just using the river paths
daegu,"definitely visit busan and gyeongju

its okay to skip daegu daejeon and gwangju they are just large cities

jeju island is a mustvisit

songdo is worth visiting but i wouldnt recommend nami island

visit seoraksan and gangneung together

id suggest suncheon over yeosu visit the suncheon bay wetlands both cities are famous for their food

consider a day trip to jeonju or combine yeosu suncheon and jeonju if you like korean food jeolla province including yeosu suncheon and jeonju is a mustvisit

andong is also worth visiting"
daegu,jeonjuhttpsenglishvisitkoreaorkrsvccontentscontentsviewdomenusn602vcontsid182528 for the bibimbap and more
daegu,if my friend comes to korea i will take them to busan and gyeongju
daegu,lots of hiking trails
daegu,cafe culture and next to hongdae
daegu,no just the top thing is a hiking trail set its fairly diverse and across the entire country its palaces folk villages hidden beaches im an avid traveler and lived in korea 15 years this map is the culmination of my favorite places
daegu,itinerary suggests for oct honeymoon
daegu,kind of surprised you have not mentioned sinsa for high end fashion
daegu,i hate the word hubby so much
daegu,thank you for the suggestion googling away 
daegu,"allow me to save you a step

httpsvisitgangnamnetentravelmaphttpsvisitgangnamnetentravelmap"
daegu,i think cheongdam is the high end street of south korea of all the neighborhoods in gangnam now that i think about it
daegu,very good to know thank you kindly for the link 
daegu,for test drives here is where you can schedule from hyundai  httpsmotorstudiohyundaicomitgridrtsrdguidedohttpsmotorstudiohyundaicomitgridrtsrdguidedo
daegu,the hubby was very interested in this thank you again
daegu,where to visit outside of seoul and busan
daegu,id highly recommend jeju its a cheap flight with great sightseeing nature and just overall peaceful vibes lots of nice towns with cute bars cafes restaurants to chill at it was such a nice change of pace from city life and theres enough to do there to fill up 5 days easily keep in mind it is best with a rental car so get an idp if you choose to go
daegu,you could go east to gangwondo and go between the different cities along the coast gangneung sokcho yangyang etc gyeongju is going to have a lot of historical sites and is the main draw since it was the capital of silla during the three kingdoms period daegu is kind of eh i wouldnt want to spend an entire week there other option would be to head down to jeollanamdo and pick a city or county there and do some hiking but if youre wanting to relax and do cafes and stuff gangwondo is going to be the best option
daegu,"for 5 days id actually agree with both the ideas given by the above 2 comments jeju or gangwondo

jeju is in general very laid back definitely more inclined towards nature there are a lot of nice cafes although they might be pretty scattered but id think getting around can be eased with a rental car  im pretty sure you could find a couple of recommendations by youtube vloggers and such also because it is an island youd likely be able to find some that can offer really nice sea views   
you can also spend a day at udo island which also has a handful of nice cafes i previously went and rented an electric bicycle to go around the island which was quite fun there are other rideables atv or scooterish types that can be rented but for some reason i wasnt allowed  to rent those even when i had my idp 

gangneung and sokcho are actually on my togo list for my upcoming trip the vibe will likely be similar to jeju"
daegu,ive just done 3 weeks of driving on another trip so i think i want to avoid getting a car  jeju might be in the too hard basket right now
daegu,10 day trip review  spend less time in seoul and more time everywhere else
daegu,sounds like you hit quite a fair few tourist traps been in seoul for the past 2 weeks and been loving it personally
daegu,"snoopy garden is and will still always be one of my favorite places to visit but im a peanuts fan so thats bias on my side

but pretty much spot on  especially gwangjang theres a particular store i always visit just infront of the netflix lady i think only she sells bibimbap with barley and i wished you couldve read some of the posts here i made london bagel museum is absolutely not worth your time i couldve recommended loulou bagels near jamsil in a heartbeat instead same for the typical cafe onion route as well no way i will ever recommend that place

and strange  ive always went to korea house  and ive recommended it tons of times most people enjoyed the food there and it doesnt have to be the 200000 krw one i definitely had more than 5 courses with the slightly cheaper dinner menu with performance as well no deposit needed too"
daegu,thank you for such a thorough review of seoul places to go and potentially avoid we are also doing a very similar itinerary for 2 weeks with 5 days in seoul i was considering checking out the nearby national park and dmz in addition to your itinerary 
daegu,thanks for the write up travelling from australia in september and have been trying to work out my location itinery still cycling seoulbusan but the other 10 days im mostly still undecided other than needing at least last 4 days in seoul with a prebooked tour
daegu,"march is the low season in jeju which is kind of a relief we went down there a week or two ago and got a free return leg on the air tickets the only thing that seemed crowded were the ferries out to marado and kapado which were full but not impossible to get on

we went to the arario art museum right near dongmun it has a surprisingly deep collection and its fun to walk through its close enough to go over to the market for lunch we at a bunch of seafood at one of the second floor restaurants and had them ship some abalone back to seoul 

a cab driver told us that inner jeju city is dying because everybody is moving to sinjeju but it seems like its having a second wave of galleries and cafes we even noticed a sign at one place saying it was a filming location for welcome to samdalri"
daegu,you dont go to the department store for true cheaper korean skincare  thats where you go for all the fancy foreign brands
daegu,thanks for the feedback we are mulling over whether to japan or skorea in may the advice is tilted in favour of japan 
daegu,how long are you staying
daegu,same
daegu,hi we were thinking of going to london bagel museum  cafe onion actually now that op and you have described as not worth the wait could you please give me your recommendations 
daegu,"hey op
how many days you were in jeju i am planning in june first week and thinking to split my 4 days in 2 days in seogwipo and 2 days in jeju city"
daegu,"honestly as a koreanamerican that just went to seoul for the first time in 20 years since i was a small child i think japan has a lot more to offer in terms of sightseeing and is more tourist friendly in general i did 5 days in seoul and 10 days in japan kyoto tokyo in early march 

i absolutely loved the food in seoul and it was cheaper in my experience than restaurants in japan but you have to use kakaonaver maps and type the food youre looking for in korean hangeul to really find the good spots that locals rate i think my experience would have been a lot worse if i didnt know the language and have family to make recommendations also korean customer service was definitely more bluntdirectimpatient than in japan in some of my experiences which can be scary for a nonkorean speaker but i really enjoyed going into those 50 year old restaurants that specialize in 12 dishes and have a small menu with no english menu available 

we stayed near jogno3ga station which i loved because it reminded me of korea when i was a kid and not as touristy as myeongdonghongdae we pretty much skipped all the major attractions except we knocked out gyoungbokgung palace bukchon hanok village and insadong in one day the other days i picked a few neighborhoodsmarkets to wander around try a cafe went into hole in the wall bars to have a beer this probably wont interest people who arent already interested in korea korean culture i can definitely see why people who follow the online itineraries of myeongdong night market coex mall gwangjang market etc are disappointed in seoul after doing those itineraries especially compared to tokyo     

i will say though the crowds in japan in the tourist spots were insanely packed we probably waited an hour for half our meals and at least 20 of our meals we just settled for fast food convenience store food or got a mediocre restaurant meal because of the queues everywhere the busy tourists areas like asakusashibuyashinjukuakihabara was a sea of people shoulder to shoulder in some areas especially on the weekend disneysea had 3 hour waits for all the popular rides on a thursday food stall lines were 1040 minutes if you want to see really cool tourist attractions and instagram worthy stuff go to japan"
daegu,what is your main purpose of visiting those 2 places coffee food or just following the hype if you just want to follow the hype then you can visit those 2 traps to see what its about i cant recommend somewhere if i dont know what you are mainly after maybe you can give me more information
daegu,it was 4 days also  left in the morning and returned in the evening we did the city on the last day after checking out of seogwipo
daegu,"thank you for this detailed feedback our korean is limited to the pleasantries please thank you okay yes no etc and we have even more limited knowledge of japanese 

we are interested in the historical and cultural aspects of both countries i am drawn more towards korea however the rest of the family is keener on japan as one member of the family has already visited seoul and the tourist attractions and spent a week in jeju  decision has to be made shortly"
daegu,hi can you suggest some good cafs for food  heading to seoul this weekend
daegu,sure we just want good food actually especially pastries 
daegu,then you must prefer gyeongju over seoul its an ancient capital city that has been around for over 2000 years
daegu,if you want a really good croissant rainreport has really good ones and if you are looking for brunch sunday arvo is my favorite cant help you much if you arent specific enough
daegu,"note that my recommendations will not have overhyped places like cheongsudang onion or layered

croissantscakes  rainreport there are 2 seongsu one has mmmhmm nice croissants

bagels  kokili about bagel brooklyn bagel farm everything bagel httpsmapnavercompsearchecbd94eb81bceba6acebb2a0ec9db4eab88020ec84b1ec8898place1543901744c1500000dhiscorrectanswertrue

madeleines  le soleil  
this is one of the best ive had they have seasonal flavors too last november it was pollack madeleines you have to go early or else it always gets sold out used to be at a slightly more inconvenient location but since it has moved to hannam i go there pretty often

pies  pie in the shop or parole  langue i prefer pie in the shop  
if you are in this area seongmisan 5 minutes walk from hongdae do allocate time for at least 2 cafes if you dont travel here often theres also oats seoul pastry yeonnamdong cherry blossom house butter  shelter everything bagel etc oats is very well known for their einspanner and its worth a try if you are just curious

cakes bites and an amazing salt bread  haru and oneday mellower daelim changgo one of seongsus landmark cafes sort of a must visit its not bad but not fantastic

something unique  magpie and tiger httpswwwinstagramcommagpieandtigerhlen

matcha  metcha

if you just want a good coffee there are many libre camel milestone anthracite etc but ill recommend my favourites  namusairo hanyakbang leesar stand up plz etc

theres many more but these are just off the top of my head and that i think left an impression or at least i returned more than once"
daegu,just googled it and absolutely a must see thanks for the tip any more recommendations
daegu,thanks so much for these i love matcha so the matcha recommendation is great too 
daegu,"maybe busan its close to gyeongju but ive never been there 
still gyeongju was definitely my favorite"
daegu,suggestionsopinions on itinerary
daegu,average sea temperature in october in busan is warm 218c712f in november also 187c657f reference httpswwwseatemperatureorgasiasouthkoreabusanoctoberhtm and httpswwwseatemperatureorgasiasouthkoreabusanoctoberhtm 
daegu,best to be in jeju or busan in late october fall will be finished elsewhere in korea in the last week of october
daegu,"i like your plan you can also do day trips out of seoul if you want to see other places too cant speak on sokcho or daejeon but daegu and many people including locals will agree with you is boring especially if youre already doing seoul and busan 100 keep jeju  i may be biased though because it was my fave part of my trip and has been on my bucket list for years 

by northern part of jeju you mean near jeju city consider changing that i went to jeju city during my trip and most of it reminded me of the city parts of busan the parts near the water dont matter because 1 you can access the water from pretty much anywhere in jeju except hallasan and 2 more of the scenic spots are not near or in jeju city going to jeju but predominantly only spending time innear jeju city is having not gone to jeju at all

my friend and i roadtripped the circumference of the island stopping at different points for the night but if you dont want to stay in the middle of nowhere in a random small town which i get then id suggest seogwipo in the south"
daegu,"wed be renting a car and driving ourselves sorry i probably used a confusing choice of words

i think based on your advice and our usual travel preferences it sounds like seogwipo might actually be a better home base for us we are quiet people who live a slow life sounds like well get our fill of busy city life in seoul and busan ive also heard jeju is the korean hawaii so i guess its probably similar to staying along the north shore of oahu vs staying in honolulu

thanks so much for the advice"
daegu,"my only question is why you would limit yourself on the northern part of jeju

like yes 4 days is short and you could have some rainy days but you could easily put in some destinations all over the island if you really want jeju is not that big

there is no point in staying near the airport imho unless you have like a very early flight and need to be there"
daegu,"very good to know thank you

we had originally planned to arrive in seoul a week earlier in october but our travel plans changed unexpectedly its good to know well still catch some fall goodness in jeju and busan"
daegu,"thank you this feedback is helpful

we are considering day trips out of seoul but it will all depend on how we get on with our energetic toddler

road tripping jeju and making several overnight stops along the way would have been a great way to do it if we werent traveling with a toddler we would do that but i think itll just be easier to settle in and return to one place if its only for 4 nights we live in regional town too so quite used to traveling a fair distance to get tofrom anywhere

the hotel were looking at is in oedodong to be honest we chose it because the hotel amenities price etc fit our preferencesneeds most of the sights and activities we are looking at are spread all over the island we planned on doing day trips hence the need for the hire car so we figured it probably didnt matter too much where we actually stayed given that extra info would you still recommend seogwipo over being near jeju city"
daegu,we wouldnt i think there has been some confusion i meant we were looking at staying in a hotel on the northern part of the island we plan on renting a car and driving all around the island to different sightsactivities
daegu,"they are incorrect my bday is oct 30 and i always know that i always miss the foliage in seoul bc i go to bangkok  and also its cooler before then but the big snap is crispy weather happens around then too

so jeju and busan will turn first  you can google fall foliage 2023 or other years and see maps like this for an outline 

httpsenglishvisitkoreaorkrsvccontentsinfobscviewdomenusn177vcontsid177021"
daegu,"totally fair re seoul day trips

sorry if i missed it but are you hiring someone to drive or youre renting and driving yourself maybe its a difference in australian vs american english lol but i definitely recommend the latter for time flexibility reasons especially if something comes up with the toddler

i see where youre coming from and its a sound plan but think of it as this like you said since you planned on getting a car dont mind driving longer distances to do things and will have to anyways you figured it probably didnt matter too much where you actually stayed  then why not stay somewhere thats slightly quieter more scenic and more uniquely jeju you can do everything you mentioned elsewhere than jeju city but the difference is youd see more of jejus heart

seogwipo might not be the most of any of those but it still is one of the most major towns in jeju so i am certain you will find a nice hotel with the amenities and other things to fit your preferences we stayed there a night in a beautiful airbnb and loved it  theres nature and views waterfalls beaches and more urban things to do cafe culture good food spots etc if your son likes the beach maybe hamdeok or hyeopjae 

i feel really strongly about this because my friend and i did actually stay in jeju city at one point on our trip around jeju  we stayed the last night since we booked the first flight out back to seoul the next morning so it was easier to be as close as possible to the airport exploring jeju city after a week of seeing every other coast of jeju it was easy knowing who ranked last

so to answer the question of do i still recommend seogwipo over jeju  it isnt that jeju city is a bad choice by any means  that island is one of the most beautiful places ive been to and i am not an island person at all  you can do better i know that i am a stranger on the internet this is a family trip and you guys definitely are hoping to do another korea trip at some point in the future but personally the way i see it is that if you are going to travel somewhere foreign go see the heart of the culture youre immersing yourself in jeju city isnt where to do that you will see the korean metropolitan life in seoul and busan"
daegu,buying bus tickets at the machine in advance 
daegu,you can buy the tickets in person if theyre available only  even days or weeks in advance
daegu,"from haeundae to daegu

is a korean interface too tall an order on bustago mobile app an option to pay by nonkorean credit card has been added it should have been also possible on the english interface but haeundae route would refuse to proceed to payment unlike some other departure points

on the initial app screen in korean tap origin to find  tab   not  tap destination to find  tab   set date tactfully tap red search bar scroll down to a suitable departure slot tap red button with fare

if you encounter popups tap  to dismiss

select a seat or multiple red  bar proceed another  for tc then you go right tab of  date of birth yymmdd and a korean mobile number fabricate 8 digits if you must check all tc boxes again then on payment page you select from the left  dropdown the  option

fill out the rest including the first 2 digits of your card pin and dob again another tc tickmark hit  bar

if by a miracle it goes through you go back to the initial screen threebar menu opright corner find the yellow ticket icon righthand side   tab again type in the same credit card number and hit the red   bar to see if your booking information is correctly loaded"
daegu,"most ticket kiosk and even ticket tellers dont accept foreign credit cards yes you can buy tickets in advance but therefore if you dont have a korean credit card you need a cashier to talk to and buy your ticket in advance because most kiosks only accept domestic cards

you can only use cash to pay at the cashier directly or sometimes even at the bus driver when there is still seats in the bus for intercity busses

now during my travels i found out some kiosks actually accept cash payment this is for small bus terminals when they dont have cashiers sitting there maybe

and i was even surprised in geoje bus terminal for instance they had a kiosk and cashiers who accepted foreign credit cards this was the first bus terminal i saw that accepted foreign credit cards i assume there might be some more in korea now"
daegu,i did try this app but i dont have korean phone number
daegu,i tried at busan daegu and gyeongju kiost at bus stations they all accepted my australian credit card
daegu,"make up a fictional number in 010xxxxxxxx format its a booking summon key in combination with date of birth


i highly doubt nonmember booking involves 2factor authentication to send anything to the number"
daegu,"omg it worked but   
      
        i dont understand these words lol"
daegu,"run translate the results are decently translated
  confirmation"
daegu,umm can i confirm that now or wait until i get on the ride thanks soooo much
daegu,"now


but if you havent until now your previous session might have expired you need to check carefully


if you succeed at getting the qr code take a screenshot as a backup"
daegu,i followed your advice and successfully took the bus to daegu the trip went smoothly and i even met lots of kind people along the way who tried to help me out just like my previous great experiences in korea thanks a lot 3
daegu,thats nice good luck with the rest of your journey
daegu,busanpohangseoul
daegu,"kobus is only for express buses i think check bustago for intercity buses i just checked the schedule and it looks like there are three buses per hour but you cannot book more than two weeks in advance and for some reason the english version of the website doesnt show any buses for this route at allso you need to use the korean site and use papago i had the same problem when i wanted to book busan  andong

but depending on where youre staying it could be more efficient to take the train as the busan dongbu bus terminal is very far from the areas tourists usually stay in

edit and for pohang  seoul there should be an ktx naver maps also shows an express bus running"
daegu,i just checked on the ktx app and there are trains directly from pohang to seoul running everyday
daegu,"thank you for this i checked and theres a busan to pohang route there but it says that the chosen schedule does not have any available trips will recheck bustago 2 weeks before our trip 

for pohangseoul we might have to take a bus to dongdaegu before we can board the ktx train to seoul

thank you very much for your help "
daegu,hello i checked on the korail website is this the ktxsancheon station
daegu,yes it is just so you know ktxsancheon is the type of train not the station
daegu,noted thank you
daegu,seoul to busan travel day after chuseok
daegu,"the 19th is probably going to be full definitely in the morning and then with the thursday and friday only as non holidays many people will take off extra days too 

its truly anyones guess but if you must travel i would buy a flight to be guaranteed sure safe"
daegu,thank you guys for all the advice i was surprised to see tickets available and was able to snatch the two i needed for my date so relived
daegu,apparently on 228 is when tickets go on sale for the rest of us in the afternoon
daegu,you may find the 19th more crowded with less options available but it should be doable albeit at likely inconvenient times
daegu,thank you so much for the information i put a reminder on my phone just in case i forget lol thanks again
daegu,and what about the 15th of september
daegu,all good i booked a flight a few months ago refundable but if i can get a train ticket id prefer that as well will also be looking cheers and good luck
daegu,dont travel 1318
daegu,no option i need to get to busan on the 15th from daegu
daegu,10 day itinerary seoul and busan maybe gyeongju
daegu,"daegu is just another city its not worth going out of your way to stop instead you could take ktx from seoul to gyeongju spend 1 night 2 full days exploring gyeongju and then take 1 hour bus to busan the nice thing about taking a bus is that you can go to any of the different terminals in busan depending on where you are staying while ktx only goes to busan station

gyeongju has a lot of tourist attractions but its otherwise a sleepy small town my partner lives there so i visit regularly especially at night like 99 of bars and restaurants close before 11 pm i would just pack your 2 days full of touristy stuff then go to busan after"
daegu,if you like shopping dongdaemun area is also good its close to jongno what kind of sim do you plan to use if you plan to use the bus or subway often i recommend esim from lg u you can get a discount
daegu,thank you for the insight i think ill adjust it accordingly
daegu,i think gyeongju would be a really good choice im in the middle of planning my october trip now unfortunately i only have 8 days but i still think im going to do gyeongju in between seoul and busan i think im going to try to cram as much into one day as possible though and not spend the night if i had more time like you i would definitely spend a night in gyeongju
daegu,korail pass
daegu,"if seats are sold out please board the train on a standing seat with a valid korail pass and passporthttpswwwletskorailcomebizbfebizbfkrpassaboutdo  official website

there are seats one or two at the ends of the train cars where the doors cargo and toilets are you can take seats there"
daegu,removed
daegu,update it was indeed very easy to travel without a reservation we just showed our korail passes and were able to sit on the jumpseat in the corridors 
daegu,amazing thank you
daegu,thanks haha were transfering in osong so i hope we have a smooth travel experience
daegu,great to hear 
daegu,best appwebsite to purchase train and plane tickets
daegu,trains you should use letskorail its the official website 3rd party sites like rail ninja overcharge and sell tickets that arent available yet you can only buy one month out
daegu,skyscanner is the best option clear your search history cookie and try it
daegu,is it a website cuz i couldnt find
daegu,thank you
daegu,yes you just add a com to it theres also an app
daegu,i found thank you very much
daegu,ive heard prices are different for com vs locals and you need korean id and telephone number to buy in local website is this true
daegu,letskorailcom is the local website and only official one railninja is some third party not associated with korail and charges a premium over the actual price the pricing is the same for koreans and foreigners on the official site
daegu,10 day itinerary 
daegu,busan has a great hiking path along the coast the igidae coastal trail i recommend starting at oryukdo sunrise park and hiking north to igidae park its about 47km and provides some really stunning views along the way its part of a larger trail haeparang trail 770km total if you want to extend your hike you can easily access by bus or taxi no car rental needed
daegu,you should consider a night in gumi instead of daegu or daejeon
daegu,"if you are heading from busan towards seoul by ktx then id usually recommend getting an accommodation near to busan station getting to the station with your luggage will be easier 

if intending to stop by gyeongju  daegu andor gumi like the other redditor suggested i would probably do something like book an accommodation in daegu for 3 nights and then commute to gyeongju  gumi the next and then daegu on the last day before heading to seoul it may even be possible to reduce one night at busan to add one more night to this section of the trip since more commute time will be involved  
if planned this way it might be worth looking at korail pass"
daegu,do you fly on delta or korean air and can you amend your ticket to add on seoulincheon icn  busan pus flight to your international itinerary without incurring a big penalty
daegu,thanks are there any places in gumi besides geumosan which you would recommend i unfortunately only speak english and looking at other posts in this subreddit it seems like gumi is not a english friendly city
daegu,"thanks for the tip on korail pass i will look into it i was planning to mainly use ktx and metros for most of my commute so korail pass would probably come in handy 

i only intended to stop in gyeongju as the google images looked spectacular 

daegudaejeon were just going to be pitstops as i wanted to check out something less rather than exploring and getting lost in all the unique things which seoul has to offer 

so i dont mind other recommendations for semienglish friendly places within south korea i was looking at gangneung as it has something called as squid sundae which just sounds awesome im assuming that you can only find it there and not in busan"
daegu,i fly delta codeshared with korean air so i should be able to change it to pus instead of icn any particular reason why you would recommend that
daegu,not english friendly but the adventurous are rewarded with a truly beautiful city
daegu,"if you are only stopping at gyeongju and staying there a night or two then korail pass may not be worth it but perhaps try doing a price comparison before deciding if a pass is better or if paying a la carte fares from gyeongju to daegu it may not be necessary to go by ktx since they are reasonably near it is possible to factor in gangneung if you get korail pass but that means you need to get to all these places within the pass validity period to make its money worth

also if im correct only the bigger cities like seoul busan and daegu have subway infrastructure  daegu has only 3 lines if that even counts so if you go to gangneung you can go there by ktx from seoul or daegu even but getting around within gangneung itself will be either by bus or walking ive been to daegu for a day trip before and actually relied more on buses to get around

i have a friend who went to gangneung just last month and i heard from her that generally the further you are from seoul and maybe busan the lesser english they use so do take note"
daegu,"im landing at icn at xxxx and i want to go directly to busan how do i catch ktx train to busan or vice versa is a recurring question weekly if not more often almost no one knows the icnpus feeder flight exists even when it solves a big portion of their problem of multiple transfers on ground transportation hauling their suitcases around so i put this prompt to everyone who asks that particular question to the extent i feel like being a bot

granted not every inbound flight to icn is suitable for connection to said feeder flight because of the large scheduled gap during the day if the layover at icn is too long then the point of timesaving would be moot

but my point is that many people dont even realize that they can search for pus as the final destination and weigh the pros and cons to begin with let alone any extra cost considerations

for reference these are the list of the icnpus flights im talking about

ke1405  0625  0735  
ke1407  0825  0935  
ke1515  1710  1820  
ke1419  1825  1935  
ke1427  1935  2045

needless to say you pay for this leg if you choose it but its on the offer by korean air so you can make a better informed decision on the costbenefit even if you ultimately opt for ground transportation instead"
daegu,thats actually a valid point
daegu,yeah i figured till the bus signsstops are announced in english i should be ok else just use google maps as to where to get off thanks for the information much appreciated
daegu,"i love the proactiveness brother i will definitely keep that in mind i always thought pus was a much smaller airport than icn and you need to transit to a domestic terminal in icn to head over to pus so was opting to take ktx as trains are always fun

i just am going to have one backpack on me and i land at icn around 10am so was just going to give a few hours for immigration etc and then take the ktx to busan around 2pm"
daegu,travelling in south korea during chuseok
daegu,"search the sub 

you will be in traffic hell trips will take up to 3 to 4 times longer on the roads or more  

dont travel until the 19th and dont travel any day after the 13th until the 19th"
daegu,driving during chuseok is the worst decision you can make my friends and i made the mistake last year and decided to drive a normal 4 hour drive took at least 9 hours we left in the morning at 9am and usually we get there a little past noon but during chuseok we arrived at around 7pm every rest stop was packed with people and we couldnt even find parking at some
daegu,"do you think we will find lots of traffic

its the most important holiday of the year what do you think"
daegu,haeinsa temple
daegu,you can take a bus to haeinsa from seobu bus terminal bus every 40 minutes or so just go there and buy a ticket 
daegu,"httpsnamuwikiwec8b9cec99b8ebb284ec8aa420eb8c80eab5acec849cebb680ed95b4ec9db8ec82acs51


this is in korean but you can read the time table hopefully you need just the left column of numbers"
daegu,thank you
daegu,half a day in incheon and other day trips
daegu,"theres literally nothing to do anywhere that early when you land and incheon isnt actually close to the airport anywhere you would go would still be like 45 mins away so just go into seoul 

and again nothing really opens until 11a anyway"
daegu,i would not and wow that is a lot of places to visit
daegu,a bit overkill with cities imo
daegu,11 days in korea which cities should i pick
daegu,i would not go to daegu and instead spend more time in busan daegu is not worth it given the length of your trip gyeongju is a mustsee for anyone interested in korean history the food in gyeongju and busan is really good moreover jeonju is a better choice for a day trip than suwon i would spend 5 days in seoul take a day trip to jeonju 2 days in gyeongju and 3 days in busan
daegu,"suwon is a good day trip from seoul

i personally would not spend more than a day in daegu andor gyeongju would probably consider these 2 locations as individual day trips from busan this way you also have more than your originally allocated 2 days in busan

jeju is worth considering too but it might feel a bit rushed to juggle 3 locations in 11 days"
daegu,tbh this is a lot of bus and travel time and wont be worth it imo probably should cut down the places you want to go
daegu,if you like historical sites you can consider jeonju its famous for their hanok village during my 3 days there i stayed iin a hanok it was a wonderful experience the locals there were also very welcoming
daegu,haha im starting to feel like a weirdo reading all these posts of people visiting so many cities and me just planning to stay in busan for 2 whole weeks you dont have to be like me but id at least cut it down by one place because thats a whole lot of time wasted on travel between places
daegu,the cherry blossoms in korea begin to bloom from late march starting a nationwide flowering that commences in jeju island then moves through busan gyeongju suwon and reaches its peak in seoul in early april particularly bomun park in gyeongju is a famous spot that attracts many visitors for cherry blossom viewing
daegu,we spent several days in gyeongju and it was one of my favourite parts of the trip history is my passion though
daegu,"i did 24 days in korea last summer and visited seoul 10 nights split in beginning and at the tail end jeonju 2 sokchogangneung 3 gyeongju 2 busan 3 and jeju 3

the one place where i wished we spent more time was gyeongju a day trip is not enough and you want to stay overnight as the nighttime ambiance is magical many sites are lit up beautifully and best visited when the sun is down  most people visit donggung palace wolji pond woljeonggyo bridge cheomseogndae at night and these sites stay open late into the evening the town is very scenic with hanok architecture everywhere and the majestic tumuli mounds that dominate the historical center are spectacular nearly 1000 years of history of silla dynasty the gyeongju national museum is amazing as well and explains everything 

there are lots of good restaurants cafes cute stores etc all clad in modernized hanok architecture we stayed in a traditional hanok called soi hanok right in the center of town and it was very memorable

you can also do a great day trip from gyeongju to see three unesco world heritage sites nearby seokguram bulguksa temple and authentic joseon era yangdong village

gyeongju is the station before busan on the ktx line from seoul very easy to get to and easy to take a intercity bus from gyeongju to busan or train depending on where you want to end up in busan which is huge city 

for an 11 day itinerary i would skip jeonju and daegu and focus on seoul gyeongju and busan probably would do 23 nights gyeongju 23 nights busan and the rest in seoul"
daegu,"suwon isnt really worth a day trip except perhaps to visit the folk village there are some palaces and fortresses you can visit but you can get more or less the same in seoul

if you want more authentic folk village experience i would go to andong and visit its hanoe folk village

if you want to explore history combining gyeongju with busan can be worthwhile but i would increase seoul to 6 days and busan to 3 days"
daegu,daegu and gyeongju can be 1 day trips put more time into busan
daegu,"hey i dont know about your mom but mine is just a few years older and would find that itinerary to be tiring

skip daeguu skip suwon gyeongju needs one day

overall korea has few historical sites the country was completely flattened by the us bombers what remains isnt very impressive jeju actually has a lot more per square kilometer and i highly recommend it"
daegu,what about one day in jeonju and add jeju
daegu,thats the itinerary i took and it was amazing highly recommended
daegu,thank you so much had not considered jeonju before  will check it out for a day trip
daegu,"based on that i think i will consider only seul and busan and include 2 day trips jeonju and gyeongju


we will do 12 days in japan right before arriving in korea and it will be absolutelly packed so will try for a more laid back korea trip"
daegu,im not that into hikes and the likes and my mom is not fit for strenous activities so we will mostly enjoy the scenarios and places around busan but since it is a trip of a lifetime for me im packing a lot of activities into the trip lmao i can rest when i get back is my motto rn
daegu,busan for more than a few days 4 or 5 seems like a lot for me personally but i dont think its weird i can see why someone would want to stay longer
daegu,you had me sold on the unesco sites for sure i didnt know that thank you so mucha
daegu,haha shit im getting the fomo now in my country germany we do get quite a reasonable time off but pay for normal workers is shit so i had to save quite a while for this trip and its also a once in a lifetime thing for me but im also gonna see gyeonju and a few days of seoul and if were getting bored in busan we can always squeeze in a daegu day trip haha hope you and your mom will be having a great time
daegu,were gonna be doing lots of hikes and also some day trips to other cities already made my itinerary and actually found something to do for every day  but yea i guess im quite a slow traveler
daegu,"the entire town and surrounding sites are all basically unesco world heritage areas including the numerous sites in the historical core of town itself super walkable as well

daegu,3 week itinerary south korea
daegu,"3d2n for gyeongju

can visit daegu or even andong if you want as well"
daegu,so you are only 5 nights somewhere else and the 2 plus weeks in seoul that seems a bit much seoul is great but still a big city i wouldnt spend all of my vacation in a big city i would do longer in busan especially if you go in the summer the vibe is just more chill
daegu,imo i would go somewhere other than seoul at the end like daegu and possibly another night in jeju also staying in a jjimjilbang would be a fun experience and theyre all over
daegu,i was planning andong at first but switched to jeonju since i cant rent a car and dont want to struggle with public transport is it okay to visit there by bus
daegu,"we will go in early september and we dont mind big cities d 
thank you for the tip we may stay longer in busan"
daegu,do you have any recommendations for family friendly jjimjibang in seoul or busan pls travelling with 2 kids under 10
daegu,thank you for the answer i will take a look for deagu and jimjilbang we will probably have eye surgery thats why i planned seoul at the end for last checkups
daegu,did you find one 
daegu,unfortunately no we visited spaland in busan on a recommendation in another thread but we were rejected at the door as they only admit children 7 years and older our youngest is 6 so you can skip that joint if you have a child under 7 good luck
daegu,please help me review my april itinerary
daegu,also does anyone have any experience getting botox in korea where are the reputable spots and how can i book in advance
daegu,"46 banpo is a bit out of the way if market interests you i suggest going to mangwon market you can try going to mangwon hangang park after since you mentioned banpo  
  
bukchon hanok village can be added on your 45 since its just walking distance from gyeongbokgung"
daegu,"for 46 is there a specific reason you want to go to banpo bridge park its about 45min1hr from hongdae with 20 minutes of walking 

48 you could also go to starfield coex or lotte tower area theyre quite close to your other locations

ktx would be the fastest way down to daegu"
daegu,"thank you for replying ill take your suggestion and look into mangwon hangang park since banpo is far out of the way

also a great suggestion to put bukchon hanok village with gyeongbokgung"
daegu,hey do you have any idea about atms at incheon airport t1 im gonna be landing very late and wanted to know if all the atms or atleast the global atms are in service 247
daegu,"i wanted to experience a hangang park and i heard the light display of the bridge was pretty now im wondering if its worth the extra detour 

thank you for your feedback"
daegu,people walk with the hanboks they rented to bukchon for pictures
daegu,im not sure about the atm but the money exchange which are banks are 24h
daegu,"most of the atms are attached to the many money exchange kiosks look for the money exchange windows and the atms are on the right side 

there are also atms upstairs directly across from the money exchanges i didnt see them until i looked back before walking out the door these atms had no line unlike the others"
daegu,mangwon hangang park or yeouido hangang park are two other more well known ones but 1hr is not that far so if you think you are going to regret not seeing it then definitely go for it
daegu,yeah i saw that on the official airport map but the atm timings on the same locations were shown as 6002200
daegu,and they are in service 247
daegu,the atms are not in the money exchange they are off to the side maybe 1 meter to the right from the money exchange windows so yes
daegu,family trip 14 days leaving in 3 weeks
daegu,"not sure you need more than 12 nights in gyeoungju if your family isnt into naturehiking 1 night is probably enough if you do like naturehiking bulguksa temple and the surrounding hiking trails is enjoyable

if youre adventurous try looking up hadong ziplines better known as asias longest there are some good eats in the neighboring towns as well 

its not a bad idea to plan your itinerary around ktx as it will save you time but if you do carbus from gyeoungju to jeonju hadong should be on the way"
daegu,"i wouldnt go to daego or andong just because ive never been there personally as a korean there are already many day trips enough also when i go to busan from seoul i prefer taking the train on the way to get there easier and faster and taking the bus on the way back and sleeping
but depends on whether its too much for your children to take a long bus after the trip"
daegu,"first of all your questions are quite broad so my responses might be somewhat general that being said ill do my best to provide some insights

personally both gyeongju and jeonju are rich in cultural heritage but i feel that visiting just gyeongju would suffice and going all the way to jeonju might feel a bit redundant however if youre set on maintaining the seoulgyeongjujeonjuseoul route traveling by train bus and train as you mentioned would be the way to go

as for daegu and andong im not very familiar with them so ill skip that part"
daegu,"i would reduce the time in gyeongju or jeonju and do andong if its an option its really cutei dont think you would need more than one night 

i have been to daegu a few times and i am having trouble remembering anything that i would recommend to a tourist with limited time"
daegu,"adventure stuff is not in our wheelhouse so wouldnt chase activities like zipline etc
reading the area there seemed to be a lot of nice walk and temps perhaps i could add a night or two in daegu instead

hadong looks like a great suggestion particularly as we are missing the tea area of boseong thanks for the tips perhaps a night on the way"
daegu,what about two nights andong and two in gyeongju
daegu,not planning on going to busan
daegu,"hey thanks for the quick reply
yes i guess the questions are somewhat general in nature 
wanting to make sure that there are no obvious issues with the plan im not set havent book anything yet 
busan we omitted due to prioritising smaller cities plus aside from myself seafood is not consumed by the family 
jeju to avoid more flights and the attractions didnt suit us 
i like the idea of jeonju due to its reputation as a foodie town
ill probably have more specific questions  thoughts as i start locking stuff in"
daegu,do you have to get to andong from gyeongju assuming im using train love the ideas will help me not overstay in gyeongju
daegu,busan is near gyeongju so i just suggested the way to go to that area basically same
daegu,"id recommend exploring the charming osung hanok village just a short distance from downtown jeonju 

you can check out places like soyang gotaek awon gotaek dube cafe and oseongje for a taste of traditional korean culture and architecture if reservations are available consider staying overnight at soyang or awon for a memorable experience personally i found this area much more memorable than the city center of jeonju enjoy your visit

daegu,bes way to get from incheon to daegu
daegu,"ktx arex seoul station  ktx 1h1h45m
 time efficient but expensive

bus airport  daegu 4h
 cost efficient but 

slow train arex seoul station  itx1h3h40m
 slowest smh scenic nah imo waste of time  money"
daegu,"if your plan is to fly into icn on korean air or delta and your international leg lands in icn in the evening earlier than 1830 theres an option of modifying your flight itinerary destination to tae daegu

if so you will be transferring airside to ke1433 icntae feeder service and go through immigration process at daegu"
daegu,"1 ktx take the arex to seoul station and take the ktx from there the arex would cost around 4500 won for a 1 hour ride and the ktx would cost around 43000 won for a 2 hour ride

2 express bus the timetable for icndongdaegu terminals are herehttpstransportationasamarunetec8b9cec99b8ebb284ec8aa4ec8b9ceab084ed919cec9db8ecb29ceab3b5ed95aded84b0ebafb8eb8490ecb69cebb09ceb8f99eb8c80eab5aced84b0ebafb8eb8490eb8f84ecb0a9 looks like it costs 40000 for a 4 hour trip 

3 other trains take the arex to seoul station and take the itx or mugunghwa trains it would cost about 30000 itx and 20000mugunghwa won for a 34 hour ride"
daegu,the 1st option is the way to go after a flight you dont want to have any more hassle just spend the extra money to minimize the headache
daegu,"i wish we would have known this earlier  we have several people coming in on different flights on the same day some too late for this
we definitely would have booked earlier had we known
will definitely keep this in mind if we return"
daegu,daegu has an airport
daegu,"which implies your party as a whole wont make it to curbside before 1900

be advised that direct airport bus from icn to daegu dongdaegu  daegu east bus terminal runs in 40minute interval after 1900 until 2300 2300 is the last departure from terminal 2 average journey time is 4 hours 10 minutes likely including a 15minute break at a rest stop near 2 hour mark

each bus is a 28seater but it is difficult to gauge how full or how empty the particular bus your party can catch will be longdistance tickets will be departuretimespecific therefore you might want to consider those who land earlier buy up the tickets for the entire party ahead of time with ample buffer and manage the buffer by elastic dinner time at the airport in case your party decides to take a bus

trains are still an option but it involves at least one transfer and net journey time adding up to 3 hours from icn to daegu"
daegu,an international airport at that tae  rktn
daegu,could you tell me where i can find the bus schedule pls
daegu,"httpsintercitybusetmoneycokr


from incheonairport no blank"
daegu,cities to visit with korail pass
daegu,"if youre here for a month spend more than just 34 days plus whatever day trips outside of seoul the korail pass might give you some minor savings by using it over the course of a few days but youd be doing yourself a disservice by using it just to quickly see a couple other areas of the country i feel like its mainly meant for people who do short trips and want to do a whirlwind tour of the country before leaving again

busan definitely needs more than 1 day i always recommend 34 sokcho and gangneung i would say 2 days depending on what you wanna do skip daejeon and daegu theyre nothing exciting or special for a tourist jeonju and gwangju you might as well do 23 nights and do both of them together instead of going back and forth to seoul just to sleep 

korea is a small country but doing day trips back and forth across the country just to go back to seoul at night wastes a lot of time a month is tons of time to properly travel around the country if you want to see outside of seoul"
daegu,skip daejeon hit jeonju if you can get to jeju make it happen
daegu,"thanks for the info its just that we already have our hotel in seoul booked for the whole time and are not really the kind of people to travel around with our luggage all the time  not really backpackers i mean 
we are already going on a trip to jeju for 2 nights and would therefore double book a lot of nights if we went around the country renting rooms everywhere we are fine with going by train by nighttime and like to see a lot in short time periods so i appreciate your recommendation with gwangju and jeonju"
daegu,"thank you for that info do you have any recommendations for either jeonju or jeju we will be in jeju for 2 nights and are planning to rent a scooter to get around the island a bit especially the southwest 
thank you"
daegu,i totally agree with what you said its a pain to check out your hotel in seoul drag all the luggages with you to a train then when you get to your destination you usually have to wait to check in you loose so much time moving around and hotels hopping korea is a small country so doing day trip like you plan is not a bad idea at all i am inter in what you end up going for your day trip
daegu,fair enough just dont underestimate the time it takes to travel around you might go somewhere thats only one or two hours via ktx but when you factor in doortodoor times taxisbuseswalking to and from stations it takes a lot longer than youd think
daegu,"two days in jeju is not nearly enough and a moped on jeju is fun but its a big place probably bigger than youre imagining its the size of the us state of rhode island

i have many recommendations on jeju as i live here  southwest is the best place in jeju"
daegu,you lose more time taking day trips to places that usually take a couple days to appreciate and doubling your time both commuting back and forth to ktx stations and sitting on trains doing day trips especially to the southern areas and going back to seoul at night to sleep is not an efficient use of time at all cities closer to seoul like suwon where you can see everything in half a day then sure
daegu,thanks for reassuring me i will probably make a day trip to gangneung and sokcho might even stay there the night depending on how much i like it and because i want to go to seoraksan also i will definitely do the gyeongjubusan trip probably with just 1 night in gyeongju now with whats been recommended to me i think i will stop in gwangju for one day as ive never been to the southwest of korea before
daegu,we are sadly on a bit of a tight schedule there snd our flights are already booked we were planning on going to the green tea fields of osulloc some hiking on hallasan and see the beaches is there anything in specific that you recommend
daegu,"oh wow thats a packed two days for people on a moped i dont even think you can rent a moped here this island is much bigger than you seem to think 

osulloc is hugely overrated its a gift shop with a museum attached their tea tastes amazing but ive never met anyone who said they were glad they went usually the opposite

if you have only a day or two on jeju and no car i highly recommend an olle trail theyre up to 20 kilometers in length usually 1417 and go past scenic spots ugly spots and always have a little mountain to climb along the way trail 10 is my favorite these days other notables are trails 1 6 9 and 18 youll get a full jeju experience on any trail you choose except for 16 that one is pretty crappy 

moreover i highly highly recommend you rebook your flights and spend more time in jeju

hallasan is bigdeal hiking not for daytrippers who plan to rent mopeds there are some lovely and easy trails along its slopes and shoulders but you wouldnt even be able to reach the slopes most likely the roads up there are steep and my little chevy spark has a lot of trouble with the climb 

if you want a good beach and hike together hamdeok is beautiful and has an oreum mini volcano you can climb for a fantastic view of the north coast you may see horses and paragliders its part of olle 19

another great option would be to get bicycles and ride around the islands perimeter it can be done by athletic and motivated riders in 24 hours but that kinda defeats the purpose my point is that its pretty easy theres a marked bicycle trail just be mindful of local drivers because they wont be very mindful of you unfortunately 

otherwise for getting around jeju you should plan to use taxis or buses outside the cities buses are infrequent so youll want to research bus schedules ahead of time theres information online in english"
daegu,well if you say that it would be much better to get a car instead of scooters we might consider that it might be easier to get around with thanks for the information we sre planning on spending modt of our time around the jejusi area anyways and just want to see some more of the island for the full day we have there
daegu,gyeongju daytrip or overnight
daegu,"i dont recommend single day trips to gyeongju lots of things to look at not enough time and i recommend spending two days

however since youre staying at daegu which is close byaround 1hr by bus i think you can do a two day trip coming back to your hotel at daegu at the end of the day no real reason to get another hotel at gyeongju unless you want yo maximize your time"
daegu,overnight there are some beautiful light displays around the city the woljeonggyo bridge is exceptional at night  cheomseongdae and the forest around it are also lit up  donggung palace and wolji pond are also incredible at night
daegu,thank you very much i just found out today that i will be there during chuseok what would you recommend staying in busan and making these day trips from there or staying in daegu and to go from there heard that travelling during chuseok isnt recommended
daegu,agreed gyeongju has really great nighttime ambiance personally i prefer wandering around the sites in the evenings since there are smaller crowds and less urgency to get to the next place
daegu,great thanks is travelling by bus with luggages suitcases managable
daegu,"it isnt recommended its like traveling during christmas in the western countries this complicates things


its still doable but if im doinging it ill prefer to do it from daegu and get hold of bustrain tickets as early as possiblebus is preferred because it gets you closer to middle of gyeongju"
daegu,"if youre coming in from busan you can take a train from busan to gyeongju  i didnt take this train i took the one from seoul to busan and the one i was on there were luggage storage areas at the front or back of the car

daegu,this year chuseok is on a monday so there will be a lot of travelling from friday evening till wednesday right so do you think its still that crowded on a monday to travel
daegu,"i cannot tell however i dont expect it to be too difficult because

1 public transportation is on overdrive during chuseok
2 daegugyeongju is short trip
3 even if the buses are fully booked trains still sell standing tickets"
daegu,and yet another itinerary check post first time in korea going for 3 weeks
daegu,removed
daegu,"hey i happen to just hit many of the same cities except busan as you but this this is a lot 

on my trip like you i was a planner but i learned something about my experience in korea  in the end i got a lot more out of korea when i began to savor it and this is what im going to pass along to you especially since you are ethnically korean and going to korea for the first time 

i read through your itinerary and here is my feedback and much is not about your specific itinerary but things that impact your plans 

traveling in seoul and around korea will take a lot longer than you think you may have to rethink everything on your itinerary because of it especially once you see for it yourself the vehicle speed limit is generally lower compared to the states you might often find yourself grabbing taxis you will walk a lot metro train stations are deeper underground transferring between stations can be an experience etc but the mass transportation infrastructure is first class 

weather will also be another curveball for you it will be hot and humid during the summer be ready for it on other days you will have rain bring your raincoats and umbrella or borrow them from your grandparents 

also bring decent masks or just get them in korea i didnt use the masks for covid as much as the air pollution fine dust which caught us completely off guard it should be better in june though if you plan to have data plan which i recommend either by sim or through your carrier  google maps has option to show air quality readings  yeah on some days it could be that i still take my mask out because air quality readings can change by the hour

monthsweeks before you arrive 1 some helpful apps if you dont have them kakao kakaot for taxis  but on main roads it is sometimes just easier to flag a cab uber backup option google translate apps that have subway maps both in english and korean 2 get an international drivers license from aaa 3 book any necessary rental cars thru lotte rental car most foreign friendly and just can the collision insurance 

once you land sim card if you dont plan to use your carrier and a foreigner tmoney card for everyone in your group

food some of my thoughts herehttpswwwredditcomrkoreatravelcomments139z6jpcommentjj689ynutmsourceshareutmmediumweb2xcontext3 i honestly dont think its a big deal to try to go out of the way for common korean cuisine your local neighborhood has tons of good variety focus more on regional specialties like in daegu i really liked the pig intestines the daegu variety really opened my eyes in jeju black pig bbq and tons of seafood in seoul hanwoo bbq expensive street food and food in the basement of department stores 

im a fan of the specific parts of your itinerary for personal experiences concerts cafe tattoo and spas but i really enjoyed the korean folk museum and your dad may too by the gyeonbokgung palace and the secret garden by changdeokgung  two things you have not listed we also enjoyed seoul sky at lotte tower there is an experience there to be harnessed outside on the top 

i assume you considered taking the ktx to daegu then to busan but i understand that might be costly to you 

for busan  im not familiar

for daegu  not that unique to your itineraryexperience to see go spend time with family and get daegu food specialties 

for jeju  i would skip the north side and recommend you stay on the south side and preferably an airbnbtype accommodation grab the car from lotte rental car and drive it seems the islanders there are used to rental cars there and the roads are easy to drive in hyeopjae beach is ok and great for korea but for me beaches is not a korean specialty if youve been to the ones in the states 

lotte world is fun its not that much of an adrenalinerush type of park just make sure you go on a slower day like a weekday 

some museums and department stores may close on certain days make sure you double check monday is often a rest day

hope this helped have fun"
daegu,"you can check out concerts on yes24 interpark and melon global ticketing sites not sure exactly when youre visiting but quite a few concertsfestivals during these two months 


i was blown away by  kakaomap  
127 dongsunggil jongnogu seoul httpkkotol4t4gquzq0 last time i visited and ill be going again im not a fan of  but their  was just amazing if its in your budget a fancy dinner at a hanwoo spot like born  bred or course dinner at bicena should be good experiences too"

daegu,very similar situation to you  korean american going w family in junei dont speak korean well lol also very similar itineraries i plan to do most of these things too color analysis shangpree lol only thing id add is a picnic at han river might dm you for recs for some things if thats ok lol
daegu,"currently finishing my 2 week trip for seoul  busan  jeju i used to live in seoul and busan 57 years ago 
youll find you get some things done quicker than expected so can do more things from other days
temples and markets once youve seen a couple youve seen them all so may find you can skip a few 
haedongyongungsa temple is a must as its by the sea beomosa is in the mountains so a different vibe gyeongbokgung in seoul is a staple maybe im contradicting myself now 

the market in jeju is all hallabong orange themed so thats also a must 

you may need a couple of early nights after all the walking and eating 

i dont have any recommendations because everything is great and ive never been in korea with family to consider very excited for you"
daegu,"im a big proponent of travelers visiting gyeongju it would be great if you could find a way to spend a day there as you travel from daegu to busan or busan to seoul

on day 5 the blueline park sky capsule ride seems out of place since its located in proximity with all the activities on day 7 

on day 7 i highly recommend taking the blueline beach train back from songjeong to haeundae near sunset if you can get the timing right a walk around dongbaekseom by haeundae is also really nice if you have time for it not too intense"
daegu,"for day 5 

 gamcheon village closes at 4 i think so this is probably best earlier
 blue line park train is pretty great if you do an all day
 at busan tower play the minigame then if you pick a bad prize ask to upgrade to the soju glass

day 7 

 haedong yonggungsa temple gets very busy and can kind of be a bummer but still nice
 hongdea beach is good but if you can do blue blind beach train its cool to see it all the hike at the top of the beach is nice that goes out to the old light house

day 10

 lotte world tower is pretty great we didnt do the park as ive heard its very kids based if you do the world tower you can do the shit bridge which would tap that adrenaline i see you have this planned other days maybe consider olympic park which is right there to

day 11

 namsan is gorgeous hike up the side with the city wall on it its a great climb with great views maybe put a love lockmemory lock while up there

day 18

 coex is good pretty big but kind of weird layout
 banpo parking was crazy when we went but well worth it hanging out wish i had a bike to ride under it

general notes 

 the city wall museum is pretty interesting of youre near by
 lotte in busan has roof top lookouts that are nice"
daegu,your trip looks great and gave me a lot of ideas may i ask though how you booked your facial with shangpree spa ive been trying to find an email of theirs that works 
daegu,"i dont know if you know jain kim the korean climber she opened her own gym in seoul that i wanted to visit but didnt have time for maybe should check that out 

httpsinstagramcomrocklandsuyuigshidntc4mtiwnjq2yq"
daegu,this is incredible thank you kind human
daegu,"this is so detailed and much appreciated

we will be driving a personal car from seoul  daegu  busan  seoul but i will be taking the ktx from busan  daejeon  seoul if end up solotripping it to daejeon for my tattoo 

i definitely am going to have to take a second look at my itinerary these next couple days and just cut it down so i can have the time to enjoy the life in korea and not be so stressed about time and getting things done more of a personal thing i need to work on too 

thank you for all this though"
daegu,will definitely check it out thanks
daegu,removed
daegu,lol i can be an intense planner which is not always a good thing thank you for your advice
daegu,of course and enjoy your trip 
daegu,oh and in jeju get the tangerines im not sure if they are in season year round but those were the best tangerines ive ever had
daegu,im gonna be completely honest i didnt do too much research on the blueline park sky capsule ride but someone else on this sub commented on someone elses itinerary that it goes to the gamcheon cultural village so that was kind of my idea for that but i know no further details about the logistics of that or if its even a thing lol
daegu,seconding the beach train
daegu,ill pm you
daegu,any chance you still have the feedback this person gave 
daegu,havent tried it sorry saw a lot of folks ordering it when i was there though
daegu,yeah i heard around octobermarch  is the season for tangerines outdoors but places still have greenhouses for tangerine picking inside is this true or is there a particular place you recommend for them
daegu,omg me too im here now and no theyre not in season ive only seen a couple dodgy looking ones on the trees 
daegu,hello uhomiegprotein do you mind sending me the email you used to book shangpree spa as well thanks
daegu,i dont know if there are greenhouses but the best one i got is in a supermarket you may have to grab one from a vendor try it right there then grab more if they are good these vendors are everywhere
daegu,if you go to the market they have hundreds so they must grow them indoors somewhere and you can buy freshly squeezed juice and also have free samples of the different types of them
daegu,korail pass or separate tickets
daegu,"not sure how much korail passes cost now but heres the breakdown of cost and times

there are only slow trains from busan  daegu if you want to catch the ktx you need to go to dongdaegu

daegu,express bus and general bus
daegu,"t money card works on all buses and metro in korea

if you want to travel other cities such as seoul to daegu  you can buy tickets using credit card in kiosk or ticket booth"
daegu,"you can buy the ticket online from kobus websitehttpskobuscokr you can also buy from the ticket booth at each bus terminal or use the ticket vending machine the vending machine has english menu 

tmoney does not always work for intercity bus especially if the seat number is assigned on purchase"
daegu,what route do you actually want this makes all the difference
daegu,6 week solo trip itinerary advice
daegu,"i travel very similarly i dont have a blow by blow itinerary but a full list of options tons and there are activities that are fan in each place such as light or drone shows  so
 with that much time in jeju id split the cities 
 no matter where you stay therell be lots to do but expect to do bus  train trips out and about in jeonju ie purple island if to like pretty  
 id say day trip to pohang as well
 accomodation in central busan near the train station is great as you can walk to lots of places but theres also the main bus stop s right there 
 id add the drone show if youre there on a saturday seoul also has one on fridays
 insadong is great and an easy walk to myeondong without staying in the chaos there lol i also stay in itaewon 
 allow lots of time for getting between places in all the cities 
 if you coffee or cake then search for the many cute them cafes around 

follow the places youre going to n on instagram as they regularly  cool places to go outside of the main tourist places

download naver maps and plot and save all the places  activities youre interested in so that you can see what is closest together otherwise youll be zigzagging and spending too much time on trains or in taxis"
daegu,party it up your missing
daegu,"generally it looks good but in my opinion 6 nights is too many in jeonju the hanok village was  for me  incredibly touristy very pricey vastly overrated but thats just me other tourists enjoy it even if you end up really liking the hanok village its probably 2 days max in my opinion the rest of jeonju is pretty average  theres some good speciality coffee cafs there and a very nice mini cinema  film poster place but that can be seen in a day 

i would recommend less time in jeonju and more time in gwangju which has a number of modern historical sites art galleries a mountain within the city its also not very touristy which could be a good or a bad thing of course this might not appeal to you as much as the hanok village in jeonju

of course you could also treat those 6 nights in jeonju as a relaxation time and just take it easy there in that case it might make more sense to shift it towards the end of your trip when youre potentially feeling more tired"
daegu,thank you for all the tips will most definitely use them
daegu,what would you suggest to party it up more
daegu,yeah why not you will soon realise the touristy stuff while ok at the start is not the best korea the best korea is the people eating out and drinking everything open at like 3 am
daegu,daegu or pohang to gyeongju 
daegu,"daegu

gyeongju doesnt have regional airports pohang has one but frequent trips dont happen

tickets you can look them up in skyscanner and buy it from there or better yet use skyscanner to only look for flights and buy it from airlines website

alternatively you can head to gimhaebusan from jeju this flight is more frequent and ride intercity bus from the airport my search showed it doesnt have that much of time difference"
daegu,"jeju cju  daegu tae route allows you to fly out as late as 2135 without regard to your onward journey to gyeongju flight time is 1 full hour but the sucky part comes from airport connections in doortodoor perspective for flights look up jin air or tway air

even though tae is relatively close to the city center public transport connection to train stationbus terminal in dongdaegu is quite inconvenient especially if youre hauling one or more suitcases youll probably end up catching a taxi

from dongdaegu train is an inferior option because gyeongju train station is quite far off from gyeongju proper journey time on ktx is only 20 minutes but then you have to find your way into the city by bus or by taxi that adds more transfers more idle time and more journey time

on the contrary bus from dongdaegu drops you off at gyeongju intercity bus terminal in the western part of the city proper which is also a transport hub for city buses and taxis but of course bus is slower than ktx net journey time will come around 50 minutes

that said cju  pohanggyeongju kpo is still a viable option for you for it being less of a hassle jin air lj438 departs cju at 1905 lands in kpo at 2010 bus route 1000 is the airport bus route running nonstop from kpo to the aforementioned gyeongju intercity bus terminal journey time 45 minutes and then proceeds further to bomun lake are where major hotels are add 30 minutes so its 75 minutes to hilton or gyeongju world

route 1000 schedule is tied to flight arrival schedule timed to scheduled landing  30 minutes when jin air revises their flight schedule for a new season the bus schedule also changes accordingly

if you look up jin air youll notice lower fares of kpo evening flight are booked up and only the full fare remains available and this fare is higher than the currently available tae flights but then kpo route saves you at least two transfers while the net journey time doortodoor comes around roughly the same

otherwise even flying into busan gimhae pus is comparably simpler because theres also a nonstop airport bus from the airport to gyeongju same terminal 1 hour ride but this bus departs pus at 1900 2030 and 2200 in the late evening unless you leave jeju earlier than 1800 if your landing time doesnt fit youd be idle at the airport

see for yourself if all of this adds up"
daegu,shopping budget
daegu,anything specific youre looking to buy luxury goods souvenirs korean skincarebeauty i personally picked up a oled switch a couple of ysl items a fair amount of red ginseng skincare and some souvenirs and probably spent around 2000  2500 in 3 weeks between seoul jeju and busan
daegu,"i think last time i was coming back i brought around 500 worth of cosmetics alone the selection is great and prices significantly cheaper than back in the uk like literally up to a 13 of what youd pay in boots for comparable stuff olive young has amazing promotions for korean fashion if you dont plan to shop in the underground malls cheap but fashionable stuff around 550 per item check out musinsas website for a ballpark number for popular korean streetwear brands like rest and recreation mardi mercredi etc 
kpop stuff also is around half as cheap as in europe you could also order from weverse global etc and get stuff delivered within days for a few quid

edited to add  only check out korean websites using google translate function if you dont read hangeul global sites have a significant markup"
daegu,im thinking nothing techy or luxury more looking at clothing skin care probably stationary bits and souvenirs maybe some kpop related stuff too 
daegu,i would say anything around 1000 is a good starting point for the amount of time you will be in korea but you could find yourself spending more like i did as there are so many great things to buy just make sure you have enough space in your suitcase as that ruined me one thing i 100 recommend is getting the light stick of your favourite kpop group have a good trip
daegu,ive paid for an extra suitcase for the flight home  thank you for the advice
daegu,good thinking not going to be fighting your suitcase like i was enjoy it my favourite place itw
daegu,best hotels for a workation
daegu,"intercontinental or park hyatt

otherwise your list is a pipe dream"
daegu,budget is extremely important because that can all be had for several hundred per night
daegu,"i recently visited seoul as a tourist and i have to say the city is fantastic highly recommend visiting the nseoul tower gyeongbokgung palace the historic hanoks traditional houses and the modern gangnam districttheres something for everyone

if youre planning a workation its worth using a special search engine dedicated to digital nomads i often use it myself when i travel for remote work 
you can check which cities in a given country offer accommodations suitable for a workation and both seoul and daejeon are listed as options
httpswwwtripofficecomrepublicofkoreahttpswwwtripofficecomrepublicofkorea"
daegu,fairmont
daegu,in seoul  check out local stitch seogyo creator town
daegu,you can start with the lowest priced hotels that still provide good value
daegu,straight up sounds like you need a travel agent
daegu,bookingcom
daegu,busan in midmarch
daegu,"seomyeon hands down best central area in the middle of everything 

and lots of food and nightlife options after a day of exploring"
daegu,recommendations rental car pickup outside seoul busan
daegu,"my friend and i did a week long roadtrip from jeonju to pohang picked up in jeonju and dropped it off in daegu on the way back driving around was surprisingly easy it took us maybe around 2 hours to fully to get the hang of how traffic lights and leftright turns worked and after that it was smooth sailing the entire way driving around daegu was fine just a bit more traffic compared to jeonju and pohang 

we used naver maps as our main navigation the hardest part for us was trying to get the tank filled up before dropping off we went to a self service station and our cards wouldnt work eventually found one that had someone on the pumps and was able to get the car filled and was able to pay with our card"
daegu,thanks very much for the tip i might consider doing the same it probably takes some getting used to but i adjusted always quite well to driving somewhere else so fingers crossed fueling up will be an experience too but should be doable especially if there is someone doing it for you i just think if even koreans warn you and tell you not to drive in busan then i shouldnt push my luck
daegu,korean 2024
daegu,personally i find both of those easy to do on your own but if you want peace of mind you can book
daegu,roadtrip outside busan
daegu,"check bus times on tmoney go app and local on naver

with public transportation your road trip is barely possible for jirisan and tongyeonsi youll have to backtrack to busan to get to these places and from busan youre looking at 3hour bus rides just to get to a bus terminal which wont include any local bus times to get to your destination then some of the intercity buses may not run at convenient times for you only giving you a few hours at your destination before you have to leave and go to the next

as for hiking your itinerary doesnt give you any downtime especially since 3 days in busan to hit all the major attractions youll be walking 2030k steps easily and those hikes you want to so are at least 4 hours or more im not sure youll have energy by the time you reach jeju which can also be a lot of hikingphysical activity"
daegu,"ah sorry by roadtrip i meant one by car edited the post to reflect this 

so we were thinking of driving to gyeongju daegu jirisan and tongyeongsi by car and stay in a hotelbb in that area so we wouldnt have to backtrack to busan every day all 4 of us have a drivers license so we can be flexible about who rests up 

and we know travel can be intense we dont necessarily have to hit every tourist attraction  we rather take our time and do half than fly all over the place same for hiking if the body is too tired well do a shorter track or go to a spa or something else relaxing"
daegu,if you have a car its fine then youll only have one big drive from dague to jirisan which is 3 hours ish depending on the entrance
daegu,please help review my itinerary are any of the days too packed
daegu,"fri  not sure if this is in sequence but insadongikseondong after gyeongbokgung makes more sense instead of going tk gwangjang market insadongikseondong is a short walk from gyeongbokgungbukchon hanok

tue  do you plan to drive or take cab if by public transport need to factor in the bus waiting times otherwise the historic city area is quite walkable altho definitely a lot of steps my favorite place in gyeongju was the flower fields next to cheomsongdae and another one at the back of hwangridangil in front of a cafe called bagel bageler not sure what it will look like in april i went during the fall

wed  haedong yonggungsa  blue line rail park  haeundae and end in spa land is doable"
daegu,"thank you for the input ill put insadong  ikseondong right after gyeongbokgung then since its no big deal if we dont get to see the stream  gwangjang market if we run out of time


since ill be going to ikseondong on friday instead are there fun areas near either dongdaemun design plaza or namsan to explore on saturday 


on our gyeongju day we will be traveling with my mom via car to see all the sights


and thank you for your suggestions for busan ive been to haedong yonggungsa before but would love to revisit with my husband for the blue line park do you basically choose between the sky capsule or the train as in they go the same places and is it wiser to do a roundtrip or oneway for trip planning"
daegu,"i have not been to but ive seen good reviews of namsan hanok village near ddp theres quite a lot of malls if you are interested to shop

i think a lot of people do the round trip but personally i found one way is enough i preferred having more time outside to just chill in a cafe so haedong yonggungsa in the morning around 8830am stayed for maybe an hour then headed to blue line rail park seongjong station the beach train goes all the way from mipo station to seongjong station and back the sky capsule goes from mipo to cheongsapo and back with no stops in between i think people ususally do mipo  cheongsapo sky capsule cheongsapo  seongjong  mipo beach train or cheongsapo  mipo beach train if you get the beach train all day pass you can alight and board at any station

i did seongjong to daritdol observatory then walked along the boardwalk until i reached cheongsapo station its a very short distance cheongsapo has cafes and restaurants so i stopped there about 23 hours for lunch and coffee then sky capsule from cheongsapo to mipo from there its a short walk to haeundae beach

if you plan to drive in busan it probably makes sense to start in mipo or wherever it is convenient to park i also saw in cheongsapo there was a nearby multilevel carpark but if youre taking public transport i think the oneway route i described would be enough for you to see all the scenery and still have time to enjoy the restaurantscafes

theres a lot of air bnbshotel options near haeundae beach 

for gyeongju since you are driving it should be easier to get around if you plan to stay till evening woljeong bridge and donggung palacewolji pond is lit up prettily at night"
daegu,thank you for such a detailed response d
daegu,one month travel  itinerary check
daegu,is it easy to get to sokcho from seoul
daegu,"ive seen people say they like gangneung better than sokcho  
i think i would take a couple days from jeonju and daegu and add on gyeongju after busan maybe  
is there something particular in daegu that you want to see"
daegu,"jeonju and daegu seems out of the way depends if theres something you want to see there for jeonju 1 night is enough if you only want to see the hanok village there isnt really much to do 

sokcho  3 nights is good if you intend to spend time hiking seoraksan or visit neighbouring places like inje or outer seoraksan easily a day trip each 

gangneung  3 nights is good if you plan to visit one of the mountainous destinations for a day trip abandaegi or daegwallyeong 

i recommend donghae and samcheok for 23 nights just below gangneung and really beautiful you can also go to hwanseongul cave 

are you planning to drive though if youre not then some of these places might not be as easy to get to"
daegu,have fun im flying out as well on the same day
daegu,yes there are many buses everyday that are comfortable and inexpensive i didnt book in advance just bought at the bus station but it might be advisable to do so if youre traveling at the weekend
daegu,thanks im considering a similar itinerary 3 weeks instead of a month and curious to know how did it go for you any retrospective tips or recommendations would you change anything in your itinerary if you could redo it
daegu,"i changed the itinerary based on some of the feedback here firstly and most importantly i had confused jeonju with gyeongju it was the latter that i eventually visited i also ended up skipping daegu 

  
this made for a simple route that i found fairly easy and enjoyed everywhere that i stayed soeul  sokcho  gyeongju stopping at a few smaller towns along the east coast for a couple of nights each on the way  busan and finally a week on jeju

  
i found south korea super easy to get around  never felt like i had to book transport in advance and there always seemed to be public buses to get wherever i wanted to go wifi is absolutely everywhere so you can get by without a sim if you fancy saving a little money the only difficulty i encountered on my trip was withdrawing money at the airport  the atms are a little testy so maybe look that up in advance though honestly i could have gotten by without cash i think id also mention that in general i found it to be a more affordable than id been led to believe  even in seoul i found lots of very casual style canteens with great food at a cheap price 

  
if i were to do it again i might spend a little longer in sokcho  the hikes are beautiful the place i was probably least enamored with was busan  most of the things to there felt too instagramy for my taste"
daegu,many thanks very useful info where did you stay at while in sokcho and was it easy to travel between the city and the national park
daegu,"yes there are frequent public buses that run from the town to the national park  if i remember correctly it took about 45 minutes

i stayed in a private room at a place called james blue hostel  i found it perfectly comfortable and reasonably priced its also a short walk from the bus station however i have pretty low standards for accommodation so your mileage may vary

during my time there i greatly enjoyed eating at this place just opposite the bus station googlemapshttpsmapsappgooglb7zemmiyppkrp4a36gstac
its a very cheap and casual place but one of the tastiest i went to in korea my friend told me that sokcho is known for its  spicy soft tofu stew and it didnt disappoint  highly recommended

theres also a great seafood market in the harbour right beside the hostel i mentioned"
daegu,whats the best unrated places to travel to during chuseok
daegu,i like exploring jeollado like suncheon ill probably head there again this yr
daegu,also check some local travel companies adventure korea etc advertise on fb they have domestic trips geared toward foreigners in korea i saw one going ro dokdo and ulleungdo doesnt everyone dream of going to dokdo which is korean territory btw 
daegu,dont travel during chuseok its a bad idea
daegu,not sure whether tourist sights will be open but my fav deatinations are gyeongjuandong suncheonyeosu and jeonju plus gangneungsokcho for chuseok though i would leave the country even if it is just a short jaunt to japan hk taiwan or similar
daegu,thank you
daegu,good luck with that flights to japan were like a grand for chuseok
daegu,i travel every year at chuseok just gotta leave a little early or bite the bullet
daegu,i meant with the flights abroad flights to okinawa were fully booked too last i checked
daegu,yeah i know i go abroad every year at chuseok but leave a day or two earlier at a minimum it is expensive but worth it imho
daegu,less common recommendationscities
daegu,"number 1 would be jeju if you enjoy hiking absolutely nothing in the mainland compares to the 27 olle trails in your shoes id spend 2 of my 5 weeks there      

here are others in relation to your timeframe and where youve been suncheon donghae yang yang gangneung jirisan chuncheon ulleungdo and gochang   

also dont cross out places youve been to i guarantee youve probably missed something huge the petroglyphs of ulsan the tripitaka koreana of gayasan near daegu the seowon of andong the list goes on     

like you i went somewhere almost every weekend for about 4 years with my now wife so have been to almost every place in korea in 2019 i made a list of every place that i couldnt visit on a weekend and rented a car  i took a a month long road trip to visit those some highlights include koreas best temple unjusa 4 days to deeply explore ulleungdo and a visit the the rural areas of boseong and central korea in 20202021 i lived in jeju    
these days i just go back to places i liked for events or make a point to visit places i missed the first time"
daegu,"tongyeon and geoje are both nice but a car makes life easier geoje has nice stone beaches 

i only spent a night in mokpo it was fine but we just drank theres an official f1 or something race track there so there may be races theres also a go kart track that was fine

im gonna throw gangneung into your travel recommendations east coast nice beaches close to the mountains too a little south is a temple overlooking the ocean  unification park i think thats how you spell it they have an nk sub that ran into a sandbar in the 90s there last time i went you were allowed to go on it too further south is donghae tbh skip it though there are some caves in the middle of the city and  commonly known as penis park worth the visit"
daegu,"mokpo danyang damyang geoje suncheonboryeong chuncheon gangneung ulleungdo paju suwon jejudo seogwipo jeju city and udoseongsan gapyeong namiseom ganghwado are my recommendations

for hiking mokpo mount paldal and then you could cable car to nearby gohado suwon scaling around hwaseong fortress walls perimeter ganghwado for the ancient fortress and temple trails jejudos sanbangsan seongsan ilchulbong hallasan and udobong

for walking around mokpo downtown danyangs eight views and gosu cave damyangs bamboo forest and river geoje island suncheon for the wetlands and boryeong for the tea fields though it could also be considered hikes chuncheon downtown gangneung downtown and its beaches ulleungdo gapyeongs nami island paju downtown suwon downtown jeju city dongmun area and seogwipo city downtown

geoje island gangneung specifically jeongdongjin beach on the beach line mugunghwa train jejudo udoseongsan are the perfect sun basking destinations because of the numerous beaches and beach walks"
daegu,"i would say tongyeong and around hallyeohaesang national park ive had great hikes and views there if you like seaish environment youll love it

also the seoraksan national park near sokcho and a bit south of sokcho you have some surfing spots if youre into that"
daegu,"did you hike mudeungsan while in gwangju going from base to peak and back takes 68 hours and theres a dozen different trails that take you into hwasun or damyang 

also mokpo is great for a coastal city visit and damyang is a stunning sleepy city that also offers so many hiking trails"
daegu,thanks for the recommendations i forgot to include jeju on my list i was there for a week last year in october it was my number one city for a revisit anyway but you basically convinced me i also have no doubt i missed stuff though i will have to see how my planroute turns out in fact i did miss all 3 places you mentioned above though something like the seowon of andong from the pictures doesnt look like it would be worth ti for me to return for it tbh
daegu,thanks for the recommendation i heard of the penis park d but i will admit if they are kinda out somewhere  as in not close to a city i miss these things because these random unique spots are just kinda hard to connect for me without a car
daegu,thanks for all the recommendations i once again notice how little i have seen of sk i mentioned the sun basking because  well it is the season after all i guess i go for the normal tourist stuff like anyone else but as i tried to indicate above by now the templesold buildingsmuseums just kinda look too similar tbh
daegu,i have been at the seoraksan national park when i was in sokcho it was the main reason i went there to be honest d  yeah the thing with anything on namhae for me was when i looked into it some months earlier buses seemed to be running rarely so back then i went to other cities that seemed easier 
daegu,i did hike there for one day yes but i never heard anyone mention damyang to be honest and it could be a potential stop if i go for mokpo
daegu,its harder to get to without a car for sure but still accessible by transit and walking maybe a reason to hit up donghae and use it as a base for the weekend
daegu,"i mean they kinda are because there is very few sects of korean buddhism left its like 80 of the temples are affiliated with the jogye order those that look pretty unique are often affiliated with a different sect or are more original if you didnt know the japanese destroyed temples all across the country in the span of their entire occupation of the country from annexation to 1945 some were destroyed during the original invasion in the imjin war or were bombed by the americans and north koreans during the korean war right after wwii ended even the palaces are recreations of the original palaces most historical sites were rebuilt remote temples like haeinsa tongdosa haedong yonggungsa ganwolam among a few others survived some of the worst of korean history

x200b

also i had like a decade of living and journeying around korea i just came back from tongyeong and i truly recommend that city for night tourism and walking around it was great"
daegu,train tickets over chuseok
daegu,"you are sol  you wont beat locals out of train tickets  there is no scenario where you would win that 

make a new plan  

chuseok is extended this year due to a 2d holiday it will be 28th through the 3rd with travel being difficult during that time and the day before and day after"
daegu,"you can salvage your trip by adjusting your plans for example arrive in incheon and use public transportation subway bus to get around 

instead of exploring korea geoje busan andong gangwondo etc by ktx or long distance bus explore seoul in depth

could you instead use the extensive seoul metro subway lines to explore the neighborhoods within seoul and parts of gyeonggido

hongdae myeongdong yongin suwon mapo gu gangnam jamsil incheon etc"
daegu,"it is said that you can easily get a ticket by using an app like yanolja in a way that even koreans are not familiar with

if you use a bus it is recommended to use the banpo express bus terminal  
however caution is needed as the process can be complicated"
daegu,i am travelling to busan on the 5th oct from seoul would it be difficult to get ktx ticket on this day as well
daegu,no people will be back at work
daegu,after the 4th it should be all good
daegu,thanks a lot this really helps
daegu,thanks this was really helpful
daegu,best whimsical plan for a four day trip not seoul busan jeju
daegu,gyeongju is quite nice for historycultural sightsarchitecture and you can do a day or halfday trip to pohang
daegu,gyungju is pretty crowded these days how about andong you can take the train from cheongryangri
daegu,gyeonju is my vote korean students go there to learn history i went there too when i was in my highschool
daegu,thanks a lot gyeongju seemed quite crowded from what ive read is it mostly a city oriented around tourism or is it tangential i guess thats more what im looking for my favorite cities have all been deeply interesting places that also had a minorpractically nonexistent tourist focus
daegu,potential tourism sites wolleongkyomoon shadow bridge hahoe village
daegu,caf recommendations your favourite or ones with unique themes
daegu,ikseondong has lots of aesthetically pleasing cafes
daegu,"there are so many cafes that its hard to know where to start a tip is to search  into kakao or naver maps and it will show you ones in whatever area youre in at the time

i live in daegu and a cool cafe with a more unique theme here is bukseongro saramdeul   in the downtown area closest subway station is jungangro  it was originally a traditional house that they remodelled and it has the theme of coal so the cakes are shaped like coal briquettes and one of the popular drinks is called a coal cream coffee    and is blackgrey in colour sounds kind of strange but the cafe has a really nice interior and exterior quite a lot of seats and the drinks and desserts are all really good 

a few other nice cafes in the daegu downtown area  daehwaui jang  slow turtle 5 mansion5 for brunch  ordinary house  gloomy    ryu coffee roasters"
daegu,cat cafes are always the easiest goofiest shit you can get yourself into
daegu,"i had the best earl grey ganache pie at pie hole  in sinchon 

the address 
  5 20
httpsmplacenavercomrestaurant21306384

its seriously the best dessert ive had in my life

theres so many cafes in korea youll be overwhelmed  i tried to avoid the packed ones in trendy areas because their food tend to be mid and over priced since the ambience is super aesthetic and thats what u essentially pay for

try visiting small hole in the wall typa cafes u walk by those tend to be the best imo"
daegu,i went to a really cute cafe in seoul where you can write a letter to your future self called nuldam spacehttpswwwinstagramcomnuldamspace  i went to the one near namsan and it had a really nice rooftop if you want views but the inside was quite aesthetic too i got a sesame coffee which was amazingly tasty youll be spoiled for choice for cafes in seoul it felt like i was never more than a 5min walk from something also visit a hanok style cafe
daegu,definitely would be keen to go for a cat or a dog cafe if you do have time to go lmk how it is 
daegu,ill definitely check them out thank you 
daegu,sounds very unique and fun ill definitely check them out thank you 
daegu,"  

hi from the future this place looks cool and im gonna probably go check it out today or tomorrow i usually use insta to find new cafes but these days there are so many ads and daegu ive noticed is especially notorious for girls using area to just post selfies of themselves

anyway just wanted to say thanks for the list"
daegu,hahahaha i agree especially when everyone tries to pet them but they run away 
daegu,i always like ones that wouldnt ruin the cafe vibes i would love to try earl grey pies in there thanks for the recommendation 
daegu,im so excited to try them all  i hope to visit as much as i can before i leave and hopefully the more unique ones i did hear about a cafe like that from a friend but i never knew the name of it you really helped me there so thank you 
daegu,youre welcome sadly  closed a couple of months ago im not sure if theyre going to open a new location somewhere or if its gone for good  the other cafes i mentioned all still exist though theres just often a quick turnover of businesses in korea
daegu,"if youre into that consider going to the cat garden heard the cats are much friendlier there since the cats roam freely

i initially added it to my itinerary but im still partial since its slightly far and i have cat allergies but who knows i might change my mind lol"
daegu,"oooof yeah they havent updated their insta since march so i guess theyre gone rip thanks for the heads up 

  and  are the good cafes that stick out in my mind in downtown daegu tho im not sure if the last one is still operating figured id try to recommend some places too haha"
daegu,korea trip inquiries
daegu,"1 some and some not 

2 your hotel or airbnb is the best place for this  places open 24 hours are not that common and usually they doesnt lend themselves to noisy patrons 

3 possible but not advisable korea is a small country but 245 hours travel time one way isnt something to be ignored

4 see answer 3"
daegu,gyeongju i would recommend at least 2d1n nami you could do in a day trip if you take the itx from yongsan to gapyeong station and then bus or taxi it takes about an hour by train and then maybe 10 to 15 minutes by taxi from the station coworking space i have no idea there are study cafes but theyre typically quiet places unless you rent one of the individual rooms
daegu,if you are short on time you can check out day trips from busan to gyeongju and other nearby locations klook or trazy have good deals i have booked mine too
daegu,for 3 i lived in busan and did a day to gyeongju just fine i took a bus and it was a really great trip i also took a day trip to jeonju i never did make a day trip to daegu but i know its possible just plan to get up early and buy your bus ticket home in advance
daegu,how to get to gyeongju from daegu
daegu,you can take a train from dongdaegu i took a mugunghwa train to gyeongju station as it is closer to town and our accommodation the ktx station is outside town which requires taking a bus or taxi from town so i took a train back to dongdaegu then ktx to seoul
daegu,"it takes about 15 hours but theres no direct bus easiest is take a city bus from the airport to dongdaegu bus terminal about 10 minutes then buy a ticket for an intercity bus from there to gyeongju 

you could take a ktx from dongdaegu as well but will need an extra transfer once you get to gyeongju cause the train station is outside of town intercity bus is easier cause the bus terminal youll arrive at is right in the center of town"
daegu,from dongdaegu station i believe you can take a local mugunghwa  commuter slow train to gyeongju station then you can taxi it into the city there is also a express bus that might take an hour or so to gyeongju bus terminal more conveniently located in the city center i recommend checking naver maps or kakao maps to know specific times
daegu,what are the places that are better to be visited with a guide  any guided tours recommendations
daegu,"basically nowhere the thing is that the places i think could benefit from a tour guide rarely have any and if they do they will be in korean only   
here are a few exceptions   
jongmyo this unesco site and shrine has almost no signage and its difficult to even understand why its a thing without a guide the guide is free every two hours as the entrance   
seowon one is koreas newest unesco sites these confucian schools have no english signage i lucked out at one in andong where a lady volunteers to guide in english for free if you visit and see the option it isnt a scam it really is free"
daegu,"as a solo traveler i think arranged transportation is a lifesaver meaning you dont have the burden of dealing with getting up at 6 am and figuring out transit alone and no one to help you out if you get turned around etc 

someone can literally pick you up and drop you off and save time in seoul of course transit is easy but andong and gyeongju its not as direct so those are places where it would help 

jeju is a whole different story  if you dont have a car you must join a group tour imo dont f with public  buses yes the exist yes people say they did it but usually time is to short to wait around for buses and what if you miss it

gwangju is not worth a day trip nor daegu

gangneung you can get there by ktx but theres truly not an easy way to get around because buses dont come on time or come at all often to places like gyeongpodae etc etc youll definitely have to prepare for taxis on your own and calling them by kakao t"
daegu,suwon is close enough to seoul and has good transport to make it pretty easy to get around on your own same with jeonju in gangwando the province sponsors tour taxis for foreigners to go around to popular spots and that can be handy since some of the spots are pretty spread out and youre not going to spend a lot of time i primarily travel solo or with my partner but once you get out of seoul metro area some spots are less transpo friendly and you need either a car or taxi for those its a lot cheaper for me to go on a group tour like this past weekend i went on a group trip to namwon and seocheon and it was only 10000 won i cant buy train tickets and accommodations for that cheap on my own they were mostly there to facilitate getting transported to the different spots and organizing the activities so i was left to mostly do what i wanted and just be back at the meeting spot when it was time to go to the next place
daegu,as for guided short tours it can be difficult to find good local guided walking tours a company called zen kimchi does some i have been on a few that were nice sometimes ill see things pop up in a social media ad for a day tour but usually they are a seoul and back trip with no option of meeting people at the destination and the few that i have been on that were governmentfunded were ok they were more event and activityoriented and less historical and cultural learning orientated with no time to really explore an area outside of the festival and event
daegu,i beg to differ regarding buses on jeju island i just finished 4 days there and travelled exclusively by public bus without a problem most places the buses run every 1520 minutes with the tourist routes 810820 running every 30 minutes the only problem is the one you have everywhere with buses is the lack of apps showing things in english but a little swapping between apps always got me the answers i needed
daegu,are you guys booking the tour on the internet or physically i am a solo traveler so i dont know how to do it alone
daegu,"most of the really good places cant be accessed by bus theyre too far inlandremote etc 

on my last two trips to jeju none of the places we went could be accessed by bus except aewol cafe beach area hyeopjae beach area and jeju city"
daegu,thats fair enough there are certainly places you cant access by bus but the places i chose were all easy to get to by bus day tours to specific placesareas or renting a car are the solution if you wish to visit hard to get to places
daegu,recommendations for dining solo vs dining in groups
daegu,transport between gyeongjusi and cheongsonggun
daegu,i am not an expert but from what i see on the korean navigation sites the fastest routes would take at least 33 12 hours might be too much for a day trip its a fairly remote area maybe rent a car for the day
daegu,"that sounds right

both gyeongju and cheongsong are considered smalltown korea cheongsong is considered rural so itll only have a few buses out to neighboring rural areas and then maybe seoul and busan in addition to the closest larger town

there may be a few more options to get to cheongsong but most likely they use a company called cash bee and the tickets are sameday purchases at the terminal only you can try reverselooking up destinations by looking on the tmoney go app from cheongsong and then when you get to gyeongju you can search at a ticket machine to see if there is a bus that goes to cheongsong"
daegu,it looks like it is much faster by car would the cost of renting be as much as some form of taxi there and back
daegu,"thanks a lot  
good to know about these same day purchase tickets"
daegu,that i dont know i would download naver and kakao maps these are the apps to use in korea and they would provide a taxi cost estimate when you look at route options you could then compare it to the cost of a rental car lotte rentacar is pretty widely used i think it is not too bad of a drive we went to yeondeok which is a bit past there from daegu in two hours and gyeongju is way closer good luck getting it sorted out
daegu,bicycle wheel builder
daegu,try contacting bikely in seoul they may not build wheels but they are a touringoriented shop and could give you some good leads phone 024750098 email bikelybicyclestationcokr
daegu,"did you check if emergency repairs that meet your model of bicycle were available here before you decided to tour korea 

what shops have you tried

httpsinstagramcomtoivocyclesigshidy2izzgu1mtfhoq"
daegu,id recommend posting your question in han river ridershttpswwwfacebookcomgroups159927500713790 fb group for more eyes
daegu,"you

i like you

thank you i will contact them immediately "
daegu,"no no advance checking required most shops can do basic repairs on wheels like retruing or replacing spokes

this is a failure of the hub ive got 4 countries and over 10000km on this hub and the hub cant be serviced without rebuilding the wheel so either way i need a wheel builder 

i checked with a shop in chuncheon they said they only have off the shelf wheels and dont know any wheel builders a shop in seoul  just said there are many shops another one said they build wheels but they cant get tubeless rims not sure why and they havent gotten back to me since

i reached out to one in busan but im not sure if they exist anymore they havent gotten back to me httpswwwinstagramcommikebikebusanhlen

toivo looks promising but their website appears to be down ill try to see if i can find them on naver or kakao thanks 3"
daegu,how would you change my plan first trip to south korea
daegu,"fully public transport is definitely a bad idea for this itinerary either reduce the number of cities or rent a car going between cities will be fine because the express bus system is good but traveling within one city will be very difficult the more you go further out from a major city a 15 minute car trip can easily be a 15hr bus trip in donghae or andong 

i think daegu is a good place to start for a trip to andong but why not stay in andong for a night hahoe village is one of the few places where you will get an authentic hanok lodging experience and there are lots of places available also hahoe is at the western edge of andong other attractions are at the eastern edgein remote locations in the mountain which makes it very difficult to travel by bus 

id also give gyeongju a proper day more attractions than pohang imo and i think you will have to do more walking compared to pohang you will be tired after a whole day of traveling with still more to see 

if you want to see more cities gwangju and jeonju 3 nights each is definitely too much reduce them to 1 nights each and explore yeosu for one night or jeonju 2 nights with gwangju a day trip 

is there a reason you want to stay so long in daegu its a good city but very unremarkable as a tourist location imo are there specific attractions you have to visit"
daegu,"dont add jeju at the end in case of flight cancellations because of the weather  airport was just closed for close two days

and i would def stay in gyeongju  there are some cheaper airbnb available and it will save so much of your travel time"
daegu,"so one of the nice things about gangwando is that the provincial government partially funds tourist taxis that can help you get around to different places just checked and saw they have a day trip option for seoraksan so that should help some 

httpsengangwontaxicomgoodsubmainhtmlbuids112"
daegu,is sokcho worth 2 nights i get the feeling it can be done in a single day
daegu,looks fine to me
daegu,"i remember going nuts when planning my maldives trip a friend suggested me a travel planner spreadsheet to keep everything in one place from bookings daily iternary trip checklist packing checklist travel expenses and most importantly budgeting    
take a look if you are interested the seller was very kind to me with all the questions i had i will definitely recommend this to anyone interested httpsplanlybyprajaktaaetsycominenlisting1561923017googlesheetstravelplannerspreadsheet"
daegu,"i wish i could rent a car but that would be kinda expensive and im already paying a lot for this trip i wish i could rent a car in gangwon bc that would save me a lot of time there but yeah i will consider this option tho 

im staying in pohang for so long just because im treating it more like a place to sleep while travelling gyeongju airbnbs are much cheaper there and its like a 30 min bus ride but im interested in pohang too so i think its a win win
i will spend a whole day in pohang then next day i wanna see homigot in the morning and go to gyeongju next day i will go to gyeongju too 

i would like to stay in daegu longer just so i could have more days to experience daegu purely i will spend 2 days to go on day trips to andong and haeinsa and i will just have less than 2 days to travel daegu no specific reason tho i just think its very pretty in terms of parks nature etc 
daegu would be the last city that i would extend my stay for tho im just sad that i dont have time for staying longer"
daegu,getting to juwangsan np  long distance taxi
daegu,"just because it shows up on kakao t doesnt mean you can get a driver also the 90000 krw does not seem correct i would expect a large upcharge there is a rural upcharge fee with every taxi service ive taken outside the main area of a town and for kakao they still put on the meter kakao t prices change depending on the time of day and how busy the area is the cheapest i have gotten is a taxi in a rural area for 20min is 25000 krw but that has been between two popular for tourist attractions the most ive been charged for that same time is 38000krw

i know another poster said you could negotiate a taxi but im honestly not sure if you can i have tried to get a taxi for rides within 20 min in rural areas and have been denied several times even in winter and gyeongju is busy even in winter if you go this route i would recommend trying call ahead of time to a local taxi service or hire a concierge service to do it or maybe try to schedule it ahead of time 

i believe the tourist information is by the bus terminal so you can ask them for their recommendation

what you are running into is very common for traveling in rural korea a lot of city hopping is involved to get places without a car"
daegu,cry baby mods banning me  lol  no more help from me
daegu,i think your best bet is to download the 1330 tourism hotline app and ask them this is a tricky one because trips to np are usually easy from a major city but this park in particular is not near any city really the tourism people will know for sure its free from the govt and in english and 24 hour service
daegu,"hi thank you for sharing indeed it seems quite challenging to travel around rural korea if drivers are not willing to drive even 20 minutes into more rural areas unfortunately i dont understandspeak enough korean to order a taxi over the phone but i do understand enough basic korean to search for some local taxi companies online and i could probably use google translate to make an appointment via kakaotalk that said these taxi companies ive found dont really have much reviews and i cannot be certain if they are reliable or not  


ive contacted my airbnb host in gyeongju to help out and he said he could help book a taxi from gyeongju to juwangsan but it will cost 200000 krw honestly quite expensive but we will probably save a considerable amount of time i was thinking if perhaps it would be slightly more affordable if we took public transport to other cities closer to juwangsan maybe pohang yeongdeok or andong before continuing the rest of the journey by taxi at the moment our only other alternative by public transport according to naver maps seems to be a bus gyeongju  andong  juwangsan about 4 hours long but that would also cost us 90000 krw since we are travelling in a party of 3 the trip back to seoul seems relatively easy in comparison because theres a direct bus from juwangsan to seoul   


of course my itinerary is still open to changes atm might consider going somewhere else that is more convenient instead of juwangsan"
daegu,"ive looked into car rental from gyeongju as a possibility but we are quite apprehensive about driving on our own because we dont have much experience driving in snow and ice provided this is a possibility during the winter time   


there doesnt seem like there is much information online about allday taxi rate in gyeongju area would it be best to try and ask at the tourist information centre in gyeongju for help"
daegu,"hi i did not know there was a tourism hotline app just found it on google play store thank you so much for your help  yes juwangsan seems like a rather under the radar destinationnational park but having looked at the photos i find the scenery there really beautiful helps that my family is taoistbuddhist so the temple at daejeonsa will also be of greater religious significance than to most visitors 

nearby cheongsong eoreumgol  definitely seems like a good winter destination for photo opportunities as well which i intend to visit

i wouldve opted to spend more time in seoul or busan instead since these are a lot more accessible but im not a big fan of cities and shopping because well here in singapore we have a lot of city life and shopping just wanted to find somewhere to enjoy some mountain scenery and since im going to gyeongju anyway thought id want to explore somewhere in  a bit more however the logistics of getting around look more complicated now than i initially thought this is my first time in the region past 2 trips to korea some years ago were to seoul jeju and gangwondo  seoraksan"
daegu,its about 100km away from gyeongju 200k krw seems not expensive
daegu,removed
daegu,cry baby mods banning me  lol  no more help from me
daegu,have you seen my map
daegu,nope ill be returning straight to seoul on the direct bus from juwangsan
daegu,removed
daegu,that seems like the only option now other than the 200k taxi according to naver maps the easiest and fastest route will probably be intercity bus from gyeongju   andong   juwangsan instead of passing through daegu maybe ill take the opportunity to stop by andong for some  hahah
daegu,need advice on itineraries for the eastsouth east and the south west
daegu,"if its just daegu  gyeongju its fine if you are gonna throw in ulsan then it might be too much travelling although still possible since i assume you are travelling light it really depends on what you want to see i personally spent 2d1n in daegu if you are free ulsan has some pretty nice stuffs like petroglyphs visit this website if you want to know more about their national treasures  httpsenglishchagokrchaensearchselectgeneralsearchlistdomnen0202httpsenglishchagokrchaensearchselectgeneralsearchlistdomnen0202  so you sort of know what sort of treasuressites are waiting for you and to see if you want to visit it in person i personally printed out the treasures and just ticked them as i went along 

same for the other part i would rather do suncheon if the wetlands are open and mokpo or even gwangju"
daegu,"im kind of perhaps unfairly meh on jeonju and ive never been to mokpo but my family loved yeosu and there are some cool things around suncheon  

  
gyeongju is full of things to see  in daegu ive only been to haeinsa which isnt actually in daegu and then drove pastthrough the city on the way to gyeongju   


if youre into hiking i can suggest a couple of places"
daegu,tbh i was even contemplating trying to do jeonju in 1 day then moving on to suncheon then doing 2 nights in suncheon and 2 in mokpo i feel like that would be way too little time to even bother with jeonju at that point but several people have recommended just doing jeonju as a daytrip from seoul which is a similar situation
daegu,im into hiking ive only started since coming to seoul though so i cant handle anything advanced
daegu,i did a 2d1n for jeonju take a look at the ktx timings first before you finalize your plan well i didnt like jeonju would much rather visit suncheon if the wetlands are open  mokpo but if you are just dropping by jeonju for the village then going to suncheon i guess thats fine
daegu,"theres a mountain called naeyeonsan north of pohang that has a trail with twelve waterfalls  one of them looks quite amazing  
near suncheon you can hike over the mountain between songgwangsa and seonamsa its around 78 kilometers lots of stairs but i dont think id call it advanced though it has been 20 years since ive done it so the details are hazy  there are buses at either end and both temples are very cool and historically significant"
daegu,how commutable are yeosu and its attractions from suncheon should i stay in suncheon for 2 nights yeosu for 2 nights or 1 night in each
daegu,"ok so for suncheon i regretted only staying 2d1n  almost a full day for the wetlands and the next day in the city tour bus i wouldve spent 3d2n and dedicate one day to boseong tea fields since it was nearby i went in the end on a separate trip but i couldve done it in one go if you plan to visit boseong 3d2n  im not sure where you are departing from but if its busan the strain covers everything all this was precovid not sure if suncheon still has the city bus 

yeosu i just went there for the aquaplanet and a lighthouse i dont have much experience there"
daegu,itinerary sanity checkadvice take 2
daegu,"volunteer opportunities are minimal unless you are fluent in korean i would not recommend teaching english as any program that is not paying you is probably a scam and possibly a church cult since the tefl market here is highly competitive and students also get free classes in public schools starting in 3rd grade 

as for things to do there is so much to do in korea and history outside of the places you are going you can go to a traditional folk village in andong or outside of suncheon in nagangeupsong do a temple stay  theres the natural beauty with seoraksan and the other national parks there are also a lot of mud flats that are important to koreas food supply  you have old fortress in suwon and jinju plenty of ontourist and offtourist places to explore including jeju the olle trail really gives you a sense of rural korea as well as jejus natural beauty"
daegu,"hongdae is cool but you can also consider living near hongik university its a vibrant student neighborhood with plenty of tiny cafes designer shops and bars i have once lived there for over a month

if youd like to add more nontouristy spots to the seoul part of itinerary id recommend

have a nice trip"
daegu,"i was planning on taking a day trip from andong from geyongjusi is that possible  my understanding was it was about a 90 minute busride oneway am i mistaken

i definitely do want to do at least one dayhike though and am considering where to take it if you have any tips  i dont want to neglect the national parks but i am definitely more interested in culture than in nature"
daegu,"thank you  ive already noted several places from the first link and will look at the second tonight

to be clear though i may very well be confused the neighborhood names are tough to keep straight as a nonspeakerreader of the language hongik university is within hongdae right  i believe we are staying relatively close the university but want to be sure i didnt book us in the wrong spot haha

thanks again"
daegu,"it can be done in a day trip but itll be a long day to get to andong its 90110 min depending on the bus that you end up taking but from andong terminal to the village its another hour the bus also comes 1 time an hour or the terminal to the city center in the opposite direction its another 30 min bus ride the bus and train stations are on the edge of the main town then the village is quite a ways away in the countryside

as for culture hiking is part of koreas modern culture infact its been dubed the national pastime and there are a lot of temples at the bottom up of mountains from them being banished in the jeosan period  i think 3 hikes that give you a balance is parts of the jeju olle trail that cercomvents the whole island taking you through a lot of villages farmland and fishing areas busan has two temples you can hike up to then to the old gates of the former fortress seokbulsa and beomeosa temples"
daegu,1 month trip itinerary advice and tips
daegu,closely watching we are also doing 1 month in october  november couple here do share your tips
daegu,"currently live in daegu its a wonderful place to to live but i feel like you can take a day off your estimation unless you want to travel at a more leisurely place you could definitely fill those days since its a huge city but if your goal is to see as much of the country as possible 2 days will do the job to show you the vibe 
i would suggest hiking up apsan mountain while here i think its the best view in the entire city its especially beautiful as an eveningnight hike"
daegu,i heard jirisan is nice to hike its somewhere in jeollado im not sure where also boseong green tea field is nice its about an hour away from gwangju
daegu,since you mentioned nice jimjilbang maybe in busan check out shinsegae centum city spaland busan we went after a youtuber recommended it wow
daegu,i got a bit stir crazy so decided on a solo trip from sept 12  24 if you are looking for someone to travel and sightsee with let me know my planning is pretty loose so ill be open to most things i never had formal education in korean so my translating abilities might be pretty limited
daegu,"recommend strongly  my favourite  in busan and i have been to a lot lol

garden 5 in seoul jamsil also very good"
daegu,i think you can spend one night on suncheon or yeosu those are nice small cities in the south jeolla suncheon has really nice wetlands and is nice for short hiking sunset is really beautiful there
daegu,"heres a sixminute video httpsyoutubel8hkjx8lgpa of our trip turn on captions for place names 

if food is a primary objective i would spend a little more time in jeollanamdo maybe yeosu and suncheon i think you could shave a day off a few places and get a little more time for that area

it looks like a great trip if you want you could hit all three jewel temples

i could help with korean practice before you go if you like"
daegu,that looks reasonable  the only thing id question is daegu  its not a bad place but not much touristy stuff
daegu,go clubbing at sinkhole in hongdae hahaha best night of my life  it was freestay safe though
daegu,this is super thanks so much will definitely do the hike any strong opinions of what im not seeing enough of  places that i should visit instead
daegu,what do you do in daegu teach english
daegu,i would maybe consider spending a day in incheon not sure how keen you are on campingglamming  but i know there are some amazing campsites basically on the beach over there a plus is that you can take the metro to incheon from seoul i havent gone myself but i think i saw a youtube video that made it seem like a really cozy activity for the fall httpsyoutube08xbkbbgkc8
daegu,does it make sense to go to korea last week of august where to start and end my trip
daegu," there is going to be chuseok at the end of my trip not sure yet where is the best place to be during those days

i think cities are kinda dead at that time and people tend to go celebrate with their families in an optimistic scenario perhaps you can find someone who will invite you in to their celebrations but youll have to get pretty creative not an ideal time for touristy stuff

i wouldnt worry about the weather i remember arriving in last month of august as well definitely warmer but it was in a nice way"
daegu,"augustseptember is extremely humid and very hot and rainy monsoon season brings typhoons every year temper your expectations with regards to outdoor activities you will do a ton of walking around and doing that all day long in 35 degree heat with 100 humidity can be very tiring especially if youre not used to it not saying it wont be an enjoyable trip but just keep that in mind when planning your itinerary 

with regards to chuseok that is a family holiday and not like a public celebration at all be wary of travelling during that time within the country bus and train tickets sell out weeks in advance as people travel across the country to visit hometowns and relatives its a good idea to plan any travel days outside the holiday and just stay in seoul or busan to avoid any travel headaches

all that being said 6 weeks is a good amount of time to explore the country and you can definitely plan a good itinerary with that much time but yeah late august will be very busy and crowded everywhere and more expensive"
daegu,"we were there from aug 21 to sept 15 and it was pretty hot and muggy especially at first but we made it work school had already started back up so most of the touristy places werent very busy

  
a few things that come to mind 

walking through the misters at gwanghwamun square if theyre still theretheyve been making some big changes to the plaza and visiting the underground museums entrances on the back sides of the two statues which are nicely air conditioned

ungcheon beach in yeosu at about 800 in the morning with pretty much no one else around  that was really nice breezy and pleasant  the evening before that we went out to hyangiram and were there till after sunset and i was still sweating definitely worth it though   


the relatively shady places felt nicer but still muggy open sun got unpleasant pretty fast  i left my hat at the place we got lunch near haeinsa and had to get a new one  


one of our nicest days was driving up the coast between ulsan and gyeongju we stopped at at a couple of beaches and i dont remember really noticing the heat daewangam in ulsan was crazy windy  


daegu is known for being hot its farther inland than most big cites  i havent been to andong but it seems like it would be hot too   


the day that we left pohang and took a bus to cheonan it was a bit hazyrainy that was toward the end of our trip the day before we left we hiked bugaksan in seoul north part of the seoul wall trail and it was still hot also not very shady for a good chunk of it but an interesting experience if youre up for about 1000 stairs  


mostly we just tried not to push it kind of had to since we had kids with us and took time to rest places originally we were talking about trying to do more in the morning and evening and hole up somewhere during the hottest part of the day but thats hard to do when youre road tripping"
daegu,"not an ideal time for touristy stuff

on the contrary only small businesses shut down for more than the 2 major days of chuseok most businesses are open or just shut down a little early outside of traveling to other cities its a good time to visit a beach area and chill or do anything touristy thats still open in a major city because there will be fewer people i traveled to both jeju and gangneung the past few chuseoks and had no issues outside of some restaurants closing at 8 pm on the holidays 

op the more outside a major city you are for chuseok the more businesses will be closed but in any major tourist city youll find things to do

also chuseok is a time to remember ones ancestors and involves going to visit family graves as well as setting up tables and photos even a mini ceremony paying respect to recently deceased family members you dont just invite someone you dont know to this type of family gathering and it would be extremely rude to even ask

op there is so much to see in korea that youll find plenty to do when it comes to the heat just make sure you take breaks when you need there are plenty of cafes in most cities i recommend making your itinerary into a loop making sure you are in the same place for the weekend of cheosuk only doing regional trips as buses between cities often are delayed by 30min to one hour despite the cost it would be a great time to do jeju"
daegu,getting to geochanggun from daegu
daegu,if there are direct buses from geochang to daegu then there are direct buses from daegu to geochang but because geochang is probably considered rural very rural then tickets will not show up on any website most likely the have to be bought at the terminal you are living from and possibly even the same day you leave if you go to the normal terminal kiosk and dont see it in rare cases there will be two different types of kiosks at the terminal the white one and a small black one that is typically run by the company cashbee that has all the smaller rural terminals on it the cashbee machine is usually same day only
daegu,thanks for the information i think i came across a schedule from seobu to geochang but it was from 2021 when my next trip comes closer ill try to verify the schedule to make plans for accommodations
daegu,sometimes you can find intercity and local bus information on the county websites however it is usually in korean
daegu,sites to see with 18 month old
daegu,"hey i noticed you dont have any responses  i can offer some help on jeju i wouldnt worry about the hikes being very tiresome or difficult pretty much all of the olle trails jeju hiking routes ive done were very chill and enjoyable walks without any steep elevation changes or anything like that maybe skip hallasan though haha if you want to know more about specific routes there is a great website herehttpswwwjejuolleorgtrailen

seeing as you have a car you have more freedom in where you can stay but i would strongly recommend the southern part of the island near seogwipo as this is where the majority of the great walks scenery  attractions are some places  walks i think you might enjoy

 sanbangsan  yeongmeori coast
 cheonjeyeon waterfalls note cheonjiyeon is a different similarly named waterfall nearer to seogwipo
 olle trails 5 6 7 and 71 especially soesokkak  oedolgae
      none of these are too difficult from memory but no reason you have to do the entire thing if its too lengthy
      website above has some more info on each my personal favourites were 6 and 7
 if you are ok climbing a fair number of steps seongsan ilchulbong is nice but skip if thats understandably too much
 there is a lovely park at the west of seogwipo if you are in the area and want something easy to do for a bit it has some space to walk around and a viewpoint over the nearby waterfalls one of the olle trails even goes through it"
daegu,"you can consider checking out some of these childrens museums httpswwwtripadvisorcomattractionsg294197activitiesc49t29seoulhtml although i havent been to any of them myself because i dont have kids or this really cute teddy bear museumhttpswwwkoreaetourcomteseum

the dmz could be pretty tiring if youre bringing a toddler though like you said all the bus tours are super early because its a 3hour plus ride to the northern border so small children might get fussy"
daegu,planning a trip to busan and the surrounding area should i stay in busan the entire time and travel out from there or stay the night at other places
daegu,"is there any reason or something particular you want to see in daegupohangulsan how many days are you staying in busan what time of year

if youre travelling lightly it would probably make more sense to just spend a night in each place to cut down on the amount of time youre sitting on a bustrain if you have lots of heavy luggage then staying in busan and doing day trips might be better so youre not carrying heavy bags around everywhere 

i would recommend taking at least a couple days to check out geoje though okpo is a fun little area most of the scenic places and beaches are kinda far out by bus though so youre kinda at the will of the bus schedules i had to use kakaotaxi a couple times to get back to the hotel cause i got tired of waiting at bus stops 

also tongyeong is worth the trip as well and is next to geoje"
daegu,"everywhere in korea can be done in one day technically ive seen lots of people including daegu ulsan gyeongju while staying in busan

if you plan to move outside of busan staying at seomyeon is best bet

check out my busan guide for more information httpswwwredditcomrkoreatravelcommentsy3ewzbaguidetobusanfromselfproclaimedbusanloverutmsourceshareutmmediumiosapputmnameiossmf"
daegu,"it depends on how willing you are to travel for long periods of time per day personally when i was younger id make those day trips these days though id probably stay 1 night per place or something like that   

must see the petroglyphs in ulsan for me but thats a personal interest that not many share"
daegu,"im mostly just trying to see as much as i can while im there but im not sure if im cramming too much in at once ill be travelling down this friday and staying until new years day so i can catch the sunrise so 8 full days plus the two travel days

im currently living in seoul to study so i can pack light in which case i guess it would smart to stay in some of the areas"
daegu,this guide is fantastic i need friends like you to help me plan my itineraries for trips like this because im terrible at it lmao thanks so much for your help ill definitely be checking out some of the places in your guide
daegu,the petroglyphs sound interesting im a big fan of historical sites so ill have to see if i can squeeze those into the itinerary too
daegu,cool sounds like lots of time id probably go overnight instead of going back and forth each day then you can work your way back up to seoul that way
daegu,19 days trip suggestions help
daegu,"ill tell you a few words if im not too involved in your trip

i think seouljejubusanother regionsseoul is a desirable route

its okay to use an airplane from seoul to jeju and a ship from jeju to busan

if you take a boat at night from jeju you can arrive in busan the next morning which is a way to save one day of accommodation

august is the peak season so you have to make a reservation 1 to 2 months in advance

take ktx when you come back to seoul from busan

since seoul is a big city and has been the capital of korea for a long time you will be able to experience many things such as shopping sightseeing food museums and history

gyeongbokgung palace is a symbolic palace in korea

i recommend you to visit

it will be a fun memory because you can rent hanbok near gyeongbokgung palace

jeju is a city of recreation so about 4 nights is appropriate

but jeju island in august is a tourist season

you can get tired due to flight reservations accommodation reservations high prices etc

i recommend black port bbq and seasonal sushi for jeju food

transportation is not a wellequipped area so you have to spend a lot of time traveling

i want to oppose it for 4 days in busan so its complicated and theres not much to seetheres only youth on the beach in busan

i recommend gyeongju which is not far from busan

it takes half a day to get back from busan and has a lot of cultural history

hwaseong fortress is good in suwon but thats all about suwon

sokcho gwangju yeosu and tongyeong are too far from your route

try new food if possible

i cant recommend your food because i dont know your taste

if possible i would like to go shopping in seoul

please purchase the gift items in jeju or use the dutyfree shop

seouls history museum war memorial hall and dmz tour would be good for the museum

the water park is about a 3hour drive from seoul

everland water park is the most used facility

there is also a shuttle bus running in seoul

other areas have famous water parks

it is also okay to visit jeju citys 5day market which opens only on the 2nd 7th 12th 17th 22nd and 27th of every month

its okay to go to namdaemun market in seoul namdaemun market is famous for braised cutlassfish

the most famous beaches are jungmun beach in jeju island and haeundae beach in busan

the accommodation in seoul is a place where many tourists gather but i dont want to recommend it

hongdae is young but i dont like it because its messy and not tidy

anyway i dont know if thats the answer to what youre curious about

if you need more information please comment and i will share everything i know

depending on how far youre going to see and what youre going to experience

i think it can be a long time or a short time

trying to experience too much can lead to failure

i hope you plan well and have a good trip

daegu,"i went to seoul and busan in august last year and going again this year all i can say is make sure you carry fluids it gets really really hot and humid 

however when i got there there was a big heatwave going on so maybe it wont be as bad this year 

there are a lot of historical sites in busan if you enjoy hiking the mountains in busan are littered with walls lookouts gates fortresses and the view at the top of them are amazing"
daegu,hi thanks so much for all the detail and recommendations super helpful i had no idea you could take a boat to jeju i think i will do 3 days in busan instead of 4 and ill check out everland water park
daegu,bussing from seoul to gyeongju
daegu,if not ktx i recommend srt its much newer and cheaper and you will depart from  and find a train that goes to  and stops at 
daegu,you know theres a slower cheaper train right
daegu,whats the confusion
daegu,i think for bus tickets you need to go to the seoul express bus terminal thats where im getting mine for my trip to seoraksan
daegu,is there a train straight from seoul or do you have to xfer in daegu
daegu,"i would want to take kobus httpswwwkobuscokrmaindohttpswwwkobuscokrmaindo but i cant find the bus terminal that alights at gyeongju gyeongju express bus terminal on the interface when i try to book a bus from seoul to gyeongju  


its my first time trying to navigate the seoul transportation system so help is appreciated"
daegu,transfer i believe im not sure where though click transfer and mugunghwa  which is the slow train
daegu,probably the express bus terminal  but it doesnt matter  the two gyeongju bus stations are just around the corner from each other
daegu,"time and cost difference

the train has a bathroom a little more space but the station is 15 min outside of downtown  maybe train to daegu and bus from there would be the most ideal"
daegu,"daegu

from what i searched intercity train from seoul to daegu is 4hrs but kobus would be 3hr30min httpswwwrome2riocommapseoulgyeongjuhttpswwwrome2riocommapseoulgyeongju this is at about the same price point so bus is a big plus for me  


my problem is that im struggling to find and book the route that the link gave me"
daegu,keep in mind that the bus can be delayed with car accidents or construction  i took a direct bus southern province to seoul from my town and it got in an hour late  a train from the neighboring town would have got me there at the same time
daegu,also whats the difference between mugunghwa and ktx would like clarity on the difference between direct vs transfer with kobus too 
daegu,"ktx is fast mugunghwa is slow

theres no longer a gyeongju station  either go to singyeongju ktx or seogyeongju mugunghwa  both are about 15 min outside of town  the bus station is downtown"
daegu,help needed  korail pass
daegu,"hello doing a very similar trip but in midnovember was very interested in the pass until i did the math and found purchasing the trips individually came out to be cheaper

i think your concern has a lot to do with availability but it is my understanding that even with the purchase of the korail pass each trip will have to be individually reserved ie a pass alone doesnt guarantee a seat within its time period i could be wrong though"
daegu,"i would doublecheckhttpsenglishvisitkoreaorkrenutrptpeng82jsp to ensure the pass will actually be a discount for you there are a lot of stipulations with its purchase i do recommend purchasing your tickets ahead of time for those dates especially if youre not traveling midday weekends in general are really busy and that is going to be the start of winter vacation for some schools 

on a side note one day is not long enough to see  busan although public transportation is good everything is spread out in the city so you may spend 30min1hour between attractions especially during rush hours i think you will get more out of 2 days in busan there is not one attraction in particular that makes dague worth a oneday trip its a nice city but its more a city you walk to and discover little things about or go to see performing arts or to the national park which is far from the city center"
daegu,thank you for this  do you mind me asking which site youll purchase your train tickets
daegu,"this is well noted  best to purchase online at which website

just intending to see bts themed places in both busan and daegu 

thank you for your tips"
daegu,get the ktx app  it allows foreign card transactions   you dont need to buy months in advance but its smart to buy a few days early
daegu,lets korailhttpswwwletskorailcomebizbfebizbfforeignpr16100dogubun1 is the official site
daegu,appreciate this thank you
daegu,appreciate this thank you
daegu,updated 1 month itinerary midsep to midoct
daegu,if you are into shopping but more so into just a crazy cool experience go to dongdaemun shopping district late at night like past midnight thats when a ton of chinese wholesalers are shopping there and will buy bags of stuff to haul onto busses waiting there go with friends and into the big mega storied mall buildings and just get lost it was so surreal for me its like dead of night which doesnt mean anything in pre covid seoul but like itll be 3 am and this one part of dongdaemun will be popping off inside the buildings its like something out of a hayao miyazaki film there are people everywhere its so brightly lit inside and welcoming there are people bustling about and so many colors and clothes from brands you never seen theyre closed on some days of the week for the night market but i remember going a few years ago and getting a full custom made suit for less than 80 usd you can haggle as well and find tons of bootlegs too if you know where to look
daegu,"re seoraksan  if you want to hike to the peak you can do it in one longer dayhikehttpswwwalltrailscomtrailsouthkoreagangwonmountseoraksananddaecheongbongpeakuiuiui without needing to stay the night in a shelter by starting from osaek and hiking up and through to the main seoraksan park area i did this a few weeks ago and it was great  the only potential challenge will be figuring out how to get to osaek the easiest is by cab if you have the funds

re weather the forecast definitely will fluctuate as it gets closer to the date and also isnt always accurate for the whole area the park is beautiful even when cloudy even if it does rain you could definitely still hike ulsanbawi as the trails are really well maintained throughout  lots of flat wooden steps many areas even have grippy rubber flooring laid out on the trails i dont recall any real rock scrambling"
daegu,my family really enjoyed hyangiram hermitage in yeosu  its not super convenient to get to but i think you can bus it
daegu,"httpskoreanvisitkoreaorkrmainmaindohomehttpskoreanvisitkoreaorkrmainmaindohome

call 1330

  
enjoy your trip"
daegu,honestly id stay a extra night in sokcho one trial already takes up 4 hours and i regretted staying there only 2 nights as the bus ride from seoul takes around 3 hours minimum due to heavy traffic
daegu,this is amazing thanks so much then i can feel confident about going even if the weather is unpredictable when is it not when hiking and can figure something out ahh am so excited will also look into the other route thank you so much really appreciate it
daegu,hyangiram looks stunning i seem to be able to get a direct bus there from my hostel perfect day trip thanks so much for the rec 
daegu,i considered this actually only problem is what on earth do i do if i have three full days of rain  then again maybe i go explore gangneung or something in that case thoughts im just thinking what my plan b will be if the weather is bad the argument in favour of 3 nights is obvs that theres more of a chance of one day of good weather ahh decisions
daegu,totally i will clarify that id probably caution against hiking to the peak daechongbong if raining bc that trail does have steep and rock scrambly parts but ulsabawi should be fine
daegu,is south korea for us
daegu,"what have you enjoyed about other places youve been

i love korea but prefer to spend more time outside seoul than in it"
daegu,"i think south korea has a lot to offer in terms of hiking tons of beautiful mountains and some coastal ones

i think seoul has a lot of cultural spots but its very much overshadowed by the shopping and nightlife and the glamour as a city then again what types of culture are you into historictraditional seoul got the palaces modernartsy fartsy it got a few good museums though also many sights commonhigh on the tripadvisor type lists are very much a social media happy place rather than substantial cultural landmark imo

i think busan is great but its a much smaller scale and spread out and thus has fewer of many things unless you include gyeongju as busan

it might work better if you share where else you have travelled that you enjoyed and why and the community could give you better feedback on it"
daegu,"which countries have you been to which ones did you like or not like and why

honestly its not like america where every city has a unique history  korean cities are all pretty much the same  seoul is just bigger"
daegu,if you like tokyo then you will probably like seoul  both cities were previously completely destroyed during wars so there isnt much historical places to visit  but when it comes to eating shopping looking at cute designs and people everywhere both cities are good along with both having a fine rail and metro system
daegu,"tldr i would recommend daejeon area or daegu if you want to stick to metropolitan citiesalthough cheongju might be the best fit for you overall

cheaper more access to nature and more centrally located for shorter travel times around the peninusla  here we go

busanulsanchangwongimhae have a great urban culture although ulsan and changwon are more neat than busan imho but itll be difficult to get to gangwon jeonju etc  also the sea would be great but hiking and outdoorsy stuff would be lacking maybe have to bus out to jinju tongyeong etc

gwangju has a very particular culture which i would love to experience having lived in daegu but not for first timers

seoul has a reputation as a newbie trap flashy lights and fun to visitbut maybe not to live

daegu has hiking opportunities like apsan along with a big urban area of 25m people and short transit times to mountainous regions like yeongju and chungju and the ocean like pohang and busan  you can also get to jinju by ktx and jeonjugwangju by bus  you can explore the entire plain of gyeongsangbuk surrounded by the east sea and multiple mountain ranges

in terms of connectivity daejeon would be best  the area around daejeon is more flat and less rugged compared to daegu though and the population would be less at about 15m with a flatter nightlife to boot  however getting to all areas of korea will be quicker with the hubs of osong and cheonanasan stations very accessible cheaply and from there the mountainous chungjujecheontaebaek corridor as well as the jeonjuiksangwangju corridor and even the yeosu area off iksan

all of which leads to my suggestion  cheongju city  its about 800k but the urban center and nightlife is big enough so you wont get bored  osong station is in cheongju and it borders cheonan and daejeon so you can get around the peninsula very easily and cheongju starts the gorgeous chungjujecheontaebaek route i mentioned before  also cheaper and a sizable foreign community

give it a shot in a country where you can get from seoul to busan in less than 3 hours living in the middle gives you a cheaper life and more nature without losing your access to megalopoli  a smaller city might be the best balance"
daegu,"edit i initially read your post as a lifemove thing like youd be here for a year or something retrospect i misread edited some parts below to make it more applicable but might have missed couple spots 

south korea has tons to offer really as new comers i would heavily encourage you see seoul and busan both can travel between via ktx but i would recommend preresearch on how to get tickets as an english speaker another spot depending on time is jeju a lot less on the urban side but depending on season may be worth checking out as its a popular domestic vacation spot 

that said if you like urban centres that are rich with a sense of adventure but still have some hikingbiking yeah you didnt say biking im projecting my own interests a bit activity nearby honestly the latter can be found almost anywherenear any city but the former is the best in seoul there are urban centres within seoul to fit any flavour you want highclass to holeinthewall to quasipocha districts which are like outdoor eat and drink spots that open at certain times 

for the hiking and biking bit the river which cuts through seoul is great for both walks and biking tons of cool foothillsmountains around to hike as well 

i lived in korea which is a different lense in my opinion from observing some posttrip posts here korea can be a difficult spot sometimes to travel depending who you are i think there are a lot of koreaboos korean obsessed westerners who are young and maybe lack life and travel experience to really know how to put themselves out there and have fun and the language barrier adds a whole other thing which again if you lack travel experience or are ignorant enough to think  korea can speak english would make it tough to travel here plenty of english friendly spots though once you know where to go 

that said it really is a rewarding place to travel and shortterm live for fun tons to due and relatively easy to travel due to its smaller size"
daegu,"busan is prettier than seoul imo because it is near the sea it reminds me a little bit of honolulu just bigger

however in general most korean cities are going to look very similar to each other and none of them are going to be as pretty as european cities for example seoul is a fun city but i would never call it pretty after living here for three years haha

korea has some of the best hiking in the world though and there is a lot of culture and history to learn about if you come people dont often realize that korea is one of the oldest continuous societies in the world

i would definitely recommend coming"
daegu,"daejeon daegu and cheongju have absolutely zero value allure and appeal for tourists seoul is a massive city but it absolutely caters to foreign visitors above and beyond 

ive lived here 11 years and have no desire or need to go to daejeon"
daegu,"i actually thought they were staying a bit longer because they mentioned staying in multiple cities  i recommended cheongju as a jumping off point because youre going to be passing through osong station the most if youre traveling the country  for short term tourists it wouldnt be ideal i suppose

it seems like your position is stronger and that only seoul busan and maybe jeonjuandonggyeongju have any value  perhaps that is true from a certain point of view and ill certainly avoid debating it"
daegu,"if you are mikesaidyes i dont want to know mikesaidno

edit i dont disagree with you  for most tourists it makes more sense to stick to seoul or busan and id heavily slant towards seoul especially for op since they voiced interest in urban centres"
daegu,1 week solo travel in march  cities to visit other than busan jeju gyeongju etc
daegu,jeongju is not too far from gwangju city jeollanamdo and there you have mokpo dried fish and mud octopus suncheon and yeosu wellknown for seafood specifically crabs hoe and eel there are a lot of excellent museums and cultural sites in those areas im not sure about rock climbing but wolchusan jirisan and mudansan national parks are also nearby
daegu,hmmm you can try visiting places like suwon wonju pohang etc wonju has museum san suwon has of course hwaseong fortress you can trek you can also visit different cities like daejeon or even taeon and its national park the dinosaur museum etc so many things to do or if nearer to seoul theres also ansan and the gyeonggi museum etc
daegu,next big one you havent visited is suncheon
daegu,the dinosaur museum sounds really good thank you
daegu,public transit and kids
daegu,until 6years old you dont pay any money
daegu,"most subway stations have a special gate for wheelchair and stroller younger kids should walk through that gate

otherwise just exit and enter together"
daegu,but for train case you better need to ask the booth in the station
daegu,also you can have a kids t money card
daegu,2 week korea itinerary  thoughts suggestions and queries
daegu,"ive done gyeongju by bus and with a rental car bus does take longer but its definitely possible if youre a good hiker you can go straight up or down the mountain between bulguksa and seokguram i hear it takes about an hour there are buses at either end the road is winding and annoying  


my family loved yeosu  hyangiram hermitage is fantastic if youre up for a lot of stairs"
daegu,"hi all

im still waiting to hear how the train situation works do i need to buy a ticket for each occasion or can i tap with a tmoney card would an tourist korail pass work better on the days im taking multiple trains"
daegu,"thats great to hear about yeosu i posted in another group and people were telling me not to go there but it looks really nice and relatively straightforward to get around so not sure why

gyeongju definitely looking like something ill need to plan out which attractions i can get buses between and frequency"
daegu,my current 3 week itinerary
daegu,your itinerary looks good i think you have a pretty good balance of everything i do recommend staying overnight in gyeongju and i dont think youd regret it if you do it midbusan you could ask your hotel in busan to store your big suitcases for you also unless theres something specific you want to see in daegu you could probably cut it out i would spend more time in busan or keep busangyeongju to 4 nights and spend an extra night on jeju
daegu,if you want to stay in a hanok do it somewhere like bukchon i would leave out the trip to daegu theres enough to do in busan and gyeongju the 5 days in jeju is more than what most do but if you are spending that long i would recommend hallasan i wish i had more time in jeju so i think its fine it seems you dont really have a lot of time in seoul itself with 25 days of trips i would also skip the trip to gwangju
daegu,im traveling with my partner in late april of next year as well for 15 days so im definitely stealing some ideas off your itinerary looks good
daegu,2 week itinerary feedback
daegu,"i think your underestimating travel time and the bus time in between locations and getting around each place you may find that some of the buses and trains will only leave a few times a day or at really inconvenient times compared with your plans since not much opens before 10a and really even 11a in korea also youre going to be going from sun up to sun down in a lot of these locations because of local bus times and lengths to get to some of the sights will take longer than you think be prepared to be burnt out at the end of your trip

jeju in particular its a minimum of 2 hours to get to some of the popular destinations by bus outside of jeju cityeven by car i dont think youll see more than 2 or 3 things while there if those things are near each other i would skip to daegu to give your more time in jeju as there is not much to see in daegu that you cant see glimpses of in your other locations  i would choose to do less your itinerary is really a 3week itinerary"
daegu,i want to go to hadong it looks lovely
daegu,"cant offer you advice as my first trip there will be in may im doing 3 weeks and am planning a lot more time in seoul

my itinerary isnt fully planned out yet but i was thinking a little over a week in seoul 8 days including the day of arrival and departure only because i heard there was a lot to do and see there and its the place i know the most about

then the remainder being jeonju jeju and busan

because of your post im going to check out gapyeong hadong and gyeongju as i really dont know anything about them and only know them by name

is there anything in particular that drew your attention to any of these places"
daegu,"this was helpful thank you so much

but yeah youre right its my first time travelling abroad so theres so much i dont think about when making plans haha ill definitely take your advice and cut down on places and look a bit more into transportation this helped a lot so i really appreciate it "
daegu,i agree it seems so beautiful if i dont end up going there on this trip i hope to go someday in the future for sure
daegu,"gapyeong is a popular camping spot its really beautiful there and theres lots of hiking places and other attractions like nami island petite france etc its a really lovely place that ive wanted to go to for such a long time haha

gyeongju has so much history theres tombs and temples and all sorts of things i really recommend looking into it

hadong also has lots of history its home to jirisan national park old villages and a lot of tea fields its absolutely gorgeous there

i really love nature and history so thats the main reason why i was attracted to these places

if you have anymore questions i can try to answer im definitely not an expert but i have a few friends from korea and they always tell me about places they like to go and things they like to see whenever they go home i can try my best to give some recommendations based on what theyve told me "
daegu,"my best advice would decide on your 3 mustsee places and if you feel overtired or want to stay longer someplace then do it i think its an easy mistake when traveling is trying to see too much in different cities it is the whole quality over quantity and sightseetravel versus explore dilemma

youll develop your style as you go on your first couple of trips im kinda stuck in the middle of sightseer and exploring i like to see a lot of historical things and still get off the beaten path  in order to truly explore and get to know someplace i have to control the number of places different cities i go on a trip

youll have a blast in korea enjoy"
daegu,thank you so much ill definitely keep everything you said in mind i just booked my flight and im trying to come up with a new itinerary i really appreciate all your help
daegu,best time to travel in spring
daegu,come at the beginning of april and youll be pretty much guaranteed to see it if youre here for 3 weeks
daegu,beginning of april is when they bloom in seoul but it varies a bit every year the govt usually releases a schedule around march id school for last week of march and into late april
daegu,recommendations for a seasoned traveler
daegu,"ulleungdo  we went with our two kids and it was amazing  
i want to hike naeyeonsan north of pohang which has 12 waterfalls  juwangsan also looks really cool"
daegu,what do you recomend for a  12 days trip first timer
daegu,im not sure if its a historical site naju image theme park  is artificial joseon village used for the shooting of historical kdramas it should be open for visitors to roam the village
daegu,ah yes i always forget about ulleungdo definitely need to find the time to get out there eventually and ill check out those mountains thanks
daegu,well i guess it depends if youre willing to move around the entire country or if you want to stick to a regionlast winter a friend and i used the korail pass to explore the north east coast sokchogangneungsamcheoketc for 9 days by train but im sure it could be condensed if you want to explore another region as well id need some more info to give useful advice haha
daegu,new lunar year travel suggestions
daegu,my family enjoyed yeosu i wanted to go to tongyeong but we didnt make it there
daegu,"basically expect that youre not gonna get train tickets anywhere its just too tough unless youre online at 630a the day they go on sale to log in early in the virtual waiting queue  and you know exactly how to use the site not worth it 

you can fly to yeosu but it wont be cheap like 8090000w one way holiday premium

there will be buses but they sell out too and you also need to be ready to hook them and for a long trip like yeosu that will be some nasty traffic 

the one good thing in your favor is that its a 5 day holiday less rush for certain days but still not easy 

i used to want to travel during the holiday but its just a lot of work"
daegu,so youre gonna pay 1000 dollars to stay at a quarantine facility for 10 days just to go on vacation for 5 days after like wtf
daegu,what will you recommend to do in yeosu and how much time should we spend in there
daegu,"if the knee injury isnt something that will affect her longterm and you can go later  is very cool  but it has a ton of stairs    
we went to  beach and walked out to   its a little island you can get to by a walkway  it used to be slightly underwater at high tide but i think they raised it up since then  

heres somebody elses posthttpsthereshegoesagainorgthingstodoinyeosukorea about things to do in the area"
daegu,family trip through south korealooking for restaurant sites and experience suggestions
daegu,"i would skip daegu and go to gyeongju the ancient capital not far 34 miles to the east of it

you can spend a day seeing temples tombs of ancient kings hiking small hills filled with relics and seeing stuff like this httpsenwikipediaorgwikiseokguramhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiseokguram

and not too far beyond it to the east is gyeongju national park which is on the east sea and quite a different vibe than the coast youll see down in busan

and you need something on a smaller scale on that itinerary"
daegu,"just came back from korea i might not be a good example since i did a lot of partying and stuff since i travelled with a friend and im in my mid twenties but if you consider climb mt hallasan prepare very very well we arrived pretty late since we landed that day and had literally no food this hike was 8 hours for us inexperienced and i swear i was never that close to just fuck it and sleep in a forrest on a mountain because i was done with everything  


anyways if you want to go to a buffet restaurant where you can get almost everything seriously its so huge they give you a map go to  marincanto  74 cheongparo yongsangu seoul    74 5  3    approx 30 pp children are cheaper  


dont miss out on bbq places since they are really really good didnt had a bad one in 2 weeks also in myeongdong and other places there is a lot seriously a lot streetfood  


for busan all i can say is take your time at the beach enjoy some shaved ice cream and just let go of some stress    


i hope this helped a little  also if you have specific questions feel free to ask"
daegu,definitely recommend nami island you can sign up for a guided tour on klook to make getting around the island easier
daegu,"seokguram

the seokguram grotto is a hermitage and part of the bulguksa temple complex it lies four kilometers east of the temple on mt tohamsan in gyeongju south korea it is classified as national treasure no
