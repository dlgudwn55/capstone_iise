used to traveling a fair distance to get tofrom anywhere\\n\\nthe hotel were looking at is in oedodong to be honest we chose it because the hotel amenities price etc fit our preferencesneeds most of

driving longer distances to do things and will have to anyways you figured it probably didnt matter too much where you actually stayed  then why not stay somewhere thats slightly quieter more scenic and more uniquely jeju you can do everything you mentioned elsewhere than jeju city but the difference is youd see more of jejus heart\\n\\nseogwipo might not be the most of any of those but it still is one of the most major towns in jeju so i am certain you will find a nice hotel with the amenities and other things to fit your preferences we stayed there a night in a beautiful airbnb and loved it

easier to be as close as possible to the airport exploring jeju city after a week of seeing every other coast of jeju it was easy knowing who ranked last\\n\\nso to answer the question of do i still recommend seogwipo over jeju  it isnt that jeju city is a bad choice by any means  that island is one of the most beautiful places ive been to and i am not an island person at all  you can do better i know that i am a stranger on the internet this is a family trip and you guys definitely are hoping to do another korea trip at some point in the future but personally the way i see it is that if you

intend of doing big shopping i really dont see an issue here even with sim 75k won and ktx to busan and jeju flight plus rental it is manageable as august is not a great travel time in korea hotels might be cheaper than junejuly  just book beforehand and you can manage your budget accordingly 80100 a day is plenty', 'also consider that august is the busiest month for holidays among koreans

same cities except busan as you but this this is a lot \\n\\non my trip like you i was a planner but i learned something about my experience in korea  in the end i got a lot more out of korea when i began to savor it and this is what im going to pass along to you especially since you are ethnically korean and going to korea for the first time \\n\\ni read through your itinerary and here is my feedback and much is not about your specific itinerary but things that impact your plans \\n\\ntraveling in seoul and around korea will take a lot longer than you think you may have to rethink everything on your itinerary because of it especially once you see for it yourself the vehicle speed limit is generally lower compared to the states you might often find yourself grabbing taxis you will walk a lot metro train stations are deeper underground transferring between stations can be an experience etc but the mass transportation infrastructure is first class \\n\\nweather will also be another curveball for you it will be hot and humid during the summer be ready for it on other days you will have rain bring your raincoats and umbrella or borrow them from your grandparents \\n\\nalso bring decent masks or just get them in korea i didnt use the masks for covid as much as the air pollution fine dust which caught us completely off guard it should be better in june though if you plan to have data plan which i recommend either by sim or through your carrier  google maps has option to show air quality readings  yeah on some days it could be that i still take my mask out because air quality readings can change by the hour\\n\\nmonthsweeks before you arrive 1 some helpful apps if you dont have them kakao kakaot for taxis  but on main roads it is sometimes just easier to flag a cab uber backup option google translate apps that have subway maps both in english and korean 2 get an international drivers license from aaa 3 book any necessary rental cars thru lotte rental car most foreign friendly and just can the collision insurance \\n\\nonce you land sim card if you dont plan to use your carrier and a foreigner tmoney card for everyone in your group\\n\\nfood some of my thoughts herehttpswwwredditcomrkoreatravelcomments139z6jpcommentjj689ynutmsourceshareutmmediumweb2xcontext3 i honestly dont think its a big deal to try to go out of the way for common korean cuisine your local neighborhood has tons of good variety focus more on regional specialties like in daegu i really liked the pig intestines the daegu variety really opened my eyes in jeju black pig bbq and tons of seafood in seoul hanwoo bbq expensive street food and food in the basement of department stores \\n\\nim a fan of the specific parts of your itinerary for personal experiences concerts cafe tattoo and spas but i really enjoyed the korean folk museum and your dad may too by the gyeonbokgung palace and the secret garden by changdeokgung  two things you have not listed we also enjoyed seoul sky at lotte tower there is an experience there to be harnessed outside on the top \\n\\ni assume you considered taking the ktx to daegu then to busan but i understand that might be costly to you \\n\\nfor busan  im not familiar\\n\\nfor daegu  not that unique to your itineraryexperience to see go spend time with family and get daegu food specialties \\n\\nfor jeju  i would skip the north side and recommend you stay on the south side and preferably an airbnbtype accommodation grab the car from lotte rental car and drive it seems the islanders there are used to rental cars there and the roads are easy to drive in hyeopjae beach is ok and great for korea but for me beaches is not a korean specialty if youve been to the ones in the states \\n\\nlotte world is fun its not that much of

day\\n\\nhope this helped have fun', 'you can check out concerts on yes24 interpark and melon global ticketing sites not sure exactly when youre visiting but quite a few concertsfestivals during these

historictraditional seoul got the palaces modernartsy fartsy it got a few good museums though also many sights commonhigh on the tripadvisor type lists are very much a social media happy place rather than substantial cultural landmark imo\\n\\ni think busan is great but its a much smaller scale and spread out and thus has fewer of many things unless you include gyeongju as busan\\n\\nit might work

seoul  both cities were previously completely destroyed during wars so there isnt much historical places to visit  but when it comes to eating shopping looking at cute designs and people everywhere both cities are good along with both having a fine rail and metro system', 'tldr i would recommend daejeon area or daegu if you want to stick to metropolitan citiesalthough cheongju might be the best fit for you overall\\n\\ncheaper more access to nature and more centrally located for shorter travel times around the peninusla  here we go\\n\\nbusanulsanchangwongimhae have a great urban culture although ulsan and changwon are more neat than busan imho but itll be difficult to get to gangwon jeonju etc  also the sea would be great but hiking and outdoorsy stuff would be lacking maybe have to

flashy lights and fun to visitbut maybe not to live\\n\\ndaegu has hiking opportunities like apsan along with a big urban area of 25m people and short transit times to mountainous regions like yeongju and chungju and the ocean like pohang and busan  you can also get to jinju by ktx and jeonjugwangju by bus  you can explore the entire plain of gyeongsangbuk surrounded by the east sea and multiple mountain ranges\\n\\nin terms of connectivity daejeon would be best  the area around daejeon is more flat and less rugged compared to daegu though and the population would be less at about 15m with a flatter nightlife to boot  however getting to all areas of korea will be quicker with the hubs of osong and cheonanasan stations very accessible cheaply and from there the mountainous chungjujecheontaebaek corridor as well as the jeonjuiksangwangju corridor and even the yeosu area off iksan\\n\\nall of which leads to my suggestion  cheongju city  its about 800k but the urban center and nightlife is big enough so you wont get bored  osong station is in cheongju and it borders cheonan and daejeon so you can get around the peninsula very easily and cheongju starts the gorgeous chungjujecheontaebaek route i mentioned before  also cheaper and a sizable foreign community\\n\\ngive it a shot in a country where you can get from seoul to busan in less than 3 hours living in the

here for a year or something retrospect i misread edited some parts below to make it more applicable but might have missed couple spots \\n\\nsouth korea has tons to offer really as new comers i would heavily encourage you see seoul and busan both can travel between via ktx but i would recommend preresearch on how to get tickets as an english speaker another spot depending on time is jeju a lot less on the urban side but depending on season may be worth checking out as its a popular domestic vacation spot \\n\\nthat said if you like urban centres that are rich with a sense of adventure but still have some hikingbiking yeah you didnt say biking im projecting my own interests a bit activity nearby honestly the latter can be found almost anywherenear any city but the former is the best in seoul there are urban centres within seoul to fit any flavour you want highclass to holeinthewall to quasipocha districts which are like outdoor eat and drink spots that open at certain times \\n\\nfor the hiking and biking bit the river which cuts through seoul is great for both walks and biking tons of cool foothillsmountains around to hike as well \\n\\ni lived in korea which is a different lense in my opinion from observing some posttrip posts here korea can be a difficult spot sometimes to travel depending who you are i think there are a lot of koreaboos korean obsessed westerners who are young and maybe lack life and travel experience to really know how to put themselves out there and have fun and the language barrier adds a whole other thing which again if you lack travel experience or are ignorant enough to think  korea can speak english would make it tough to travel here plenty of english friendly spots though once you know where to go \\n\\nthat said it

card with cash either at a kiosk in a subway station english menus usually available or at any convenience store\\n\\nyoull be fine with the tmoney card in middlesized cities and even the small cities worst case scenario you can always carry 2030000 krw and buy a singleride pass for a subway and most buses still accept cash\\n\\nalways be sure that when you leave a bus that you scan your card on the way out also you dont have to but if you intend on transferring or catching another bus or subway within 30 minutes scanning the card on the way out will ensure that your next scan counts as a transfer low or no cost and not a new ride full cost good way to make sure you save a few krw if you plan on using a lot of public transport and i recommend that you do koreas public transit is toptier', 'tmoney is the easiest way to get around on public transport i use mine everyday and have used it all over the country no problems i suggest you keep smaller amounts on it less than 20000 and top it up a little more frequently just in case it gets lost in cities with no subway and no card reload machine you can add cash to it at any convenience store just hand it to the cashier with the cash amount and say     or tmoney choongjeon haejuseyo which means please refill my card\\n\\nalso a super helpful app is the tbalance check app to see the balance left on your card the card readers on buses will also tell you the balance left over\\n\\nyoull be fine in smaller cities with no subway lines i live in one and get around just fine using the buses theyre very efficient',

reject this one was koreas first bid in 1992 again korea thought this would be a thing and made a whole celadon land complete with museums camp sites and even a celadon pool and buildings with celadon tiles it is also largely abandoned the big draw were legit workshops and shops where celadon is still sold but many figured long ago that with koreas super cheap shipping it was easier and more

other areas if youre willing to stay outside the tourist spots but near a bus stop or a train station you can save a lot thats what ill be doing \\n\\nit also depends on what type of accommodation you will be staying in if youre in a hostel you will likely be eating out every night and day but it can be cheap to eat out in korea however ill be renting an airbnb and cooking to save money as well be careful though from what my korean friends have told me grocery shopping can be expensive as well in terms of price hostels are obviously the cheapest way to go ive heard that airbnbs and hotels in seoul are almost the same price but from what i have seen hotels are still quite a bit more expensive \\n\\nit also depends on your activities it looks like youre going to do quite a bit of traveling

that even counts so if you go to gangneung you can go there by ktx from seoul or daegu even but getting around within gangneung itself will be either by bus or walking ive been to daegu for a day trip

large scheduled gap during the day if the layover at icn is too long then the point of timesaving would be moot\\n\\nbut my point is that many people dont even realize that they can search for pus as

speed limit is generally lower compared to the states you might often find yourself grabbing taxis you will walk a lot metro train stations are deeper underground transferring between stations can be an experience etc but the mass transportation infrastructure is first class \\n\\nweather will also be another curveball for you it will be hot and humid during the summer be ready for it on other days you will have rain bring your raincoats and umbrella or borrow them from your grandparents \\n\\nalso bring decent masks or just get them in korea i didnt use the masks for covid as much as the air pollution fine dust which caught us completely off guard it should be better in june though if you plan to have data plan which i recommend either by sim or through your carrier  google maps has option to show air quality readings  yeah on some days it could be that i still take my mask out because air quality readings can change by the hour\\n\\nmonthsweeks before you arrive 1 some helpful apps if you dont have them kakao kakaot for taxis  but on main roads it is sometimes just easier to flag a cab uber backup option google translate apps that have subway maps both in english and korean 2 get an international drivers license from aaa 3 book any necessary rental cars thru lotte rental car most foreign friendly and just can the collision insurance \\n\\nonce you land sim card if you dont plan to use your carrier and a foreigner tmoney card for everyone in your group\\n\\nfood some of my thoughts herehttpswwwredditcomrkoreatravelcomments139z6jpcommentjj689ynutmsourceshareutmmediumweb2xcontext3 i honestly dont think its a big deal to try to go out of the way for common korean cuisine your local neighborhood has tons of good variety focus more on regional specialties like in daegu i really liked the pig intestines the daegu variety really opened my eyes in jeju black pig bbq and tons of seafood in seoul hanwoo bbq expensive street food and food in the basement of department stores \\n\\nim a fan of the specific parts of your itinerary for personal experiences concerts cafe tattoo and spas but i really enjoyed the korean folk museum and your dad may too by the gyeonbokgung palace and the secret garden by changdeokgung  two things you have not listed we also enjoyed seoul sky at lotte tower there is an experience there to be harnessed outside on the top \\n\\ni assume you considered taking the ktx to daegu then to busan but i understand that might be costly to you \\n\\nfor busan  im not familiar\\n\\nfor daegu  not that unique to your itineraryexperience to see go spend time with family and get daegu food specialties \\n\\nfor jeju  i would skip the north side and recommend you stay on the south side and preferably an airbnbtype accommodation grab the car from lotte rental car and drive it seems the islanders there are used to rental cars there and the roads are easy to drive in hyeopjae beach is ok and great for korea but for me beaches is not a korean specialty if youve been to the ones in the states \\n\\nlotte world is fun its not that much of an

more suitcases youll probably end up catching a taxi\\n\\nfrom dongdaegu train is an inferior option because gyeongju train station is quite far off from gyeongju proper journey time on ktx is only 20

currently available tae flights but then kpo route saves you at least two transfers while the net journey time doortodoor comes around roughly the same\\n\\notherwise even flying into busan gimhae pus

at all be wary of travelling during that time within the country bus and train tickets sell out weeks in advance as people travel across the country to visit hometowns and relatives its a good idea to plan any travel days outside the holiday and just stay in seoul or busan to avoid any travel headaches\\n\\nall that being said 6 weeks is a good amount of time to explore the country and you can

the area around daejeon is more flat and less rugged compared to daegu though and the population would be less at about 15m with a flatter nightlife to boot  however getting to all areas of korea will be quicker with the hubs of osong and cheonanasan stations very accessible cheaply and from there the mountainous chungjujecheontaebaek corridor as well as the jeonjuiksangwangju corridor and even the yeosu area off iksan\\n\\nall of which leads to my suggestion  cheongju city  its about 800k but the urban center and nightlife is big enough so you wont get bored  osong station is in cheongju and it borders cheonan and daejeon so you can get around the peninsula very easily and cheongju starts the gorgeous chungjujecheontaebaek route i mentioned before  also cheaper and a sizable foreign

different cities it is the whole quality over quantity and sightseetravel versus explore dilemma\\n\\nyoull develop your style as you go on your first couple of trips im kinda stuck in the middle of sightseer and exploring i like to see a lot of historical things and still get off the beaten path  in order to truly explore and get to know someplace i have to control the number of places different cities i go on a trip\\n\\nyoull have a blast in korea enjoy', 'thank you so much ill definitely keep everything you said in mind i just booked my flight and im trying to come up with a new itinerary i really appreciate all your help', 'best time to travel in spring', 'come at the beginning of april and youll be pretty much guaranteed to see it if youre here for 3 weeks', 'beginning of april is when they bloom in seoul but it varies a bit every year the govt usually releases a schedule around march id school for last week of march and into late april', 'recommendations for a seasoned traveler', 'ulleungdo  we went with our two kids and it was amazing  \\ni want to hike naeyeonsan north of pohang which has 12 waterfalls  juwangsan also looks really cool', 'what do you recomend for a  12 days trip first timer', 'im not sure if its a historical site naju image theme park  is artificial joseon village used for the shooting of historical kdramas it should be open for visitors to roam the village', 'ah yes i always forget about ulleungdo definitely need to find the time to get out there eventually and ill check out those mountains thanks', 'well i guess it depends if youre willing to move around the entire country or if you want to stick to a regionlast winter a friend and i used the korail pass to explore the north east coast sokchogangneungsamcheoketc for 9 days by train but im sure it could be condensed if you want to explore another region as well id need some more info to give useful advice haha', 'new lunar year travel suggestions', 'my family enjoyed yeosu i wanted to go to tongyeong but we didnt make it there', 'basically expect that youre not gonna get train tickets anywhere its just too tough unless youre online at 630a the day they go on sale to log in early in the virtual waiting queue  and you know exactly how to use the site not worth it \\n\\nyou can fly to yeosu but it wont be cheap like 8090000w one way holiday premium\\n\\nthere will be buses but they sell out too and you also need to be ready to hook them and for a long trip like yeosu that will be some nasty traffic \\n\\nthe one good thing in your favor is that its a 5 day holiday less rush for certain days but still not easy \\n\\ni used to want to travel during the holiday but its just a lot of work', 'so youre gonna pay 1000 dollars to stay at a quarantine facility for 10 days just to go on vacation for 5 days after like wtf', 'what will you recommend to do in yeosu and how much time should we spend in there', 'if the knee injury isnt something that will affect her longterm and you can go later  is very cool  but it has a ton of stairs    \\nwe went to  beach and walked out to   its a little island you can get to by a walkway  it used to be slightly underwater at high tide but i think they raised it up since then  \\n\\nheres somebody elses posthttpsthereshegoesagainorgthingstodoinyeosukorea about things to do in the area', 'family trip through south korealooking for restaurant sites and experience suggestions', 'i would skip daegu and go to gyeongju the ancient capital not far 34 miles to the east of it\\n\\nyou can spend a day seeing temples tombs of ancient kings hiking small hills filled with relics and seeing stuff like this httpsenwikipediaorgwikiseokguramhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiseokguram\\n\\nand not too far beyond it to the east is gyeongju national park which is on the east sea and quite a different vibe than the coast youll see down in busan\\n\\nand you need something on a smaller scale on that itinerary', 'just came back from korea i might not be a good example since i did a lot of partying and stuff since i travelled with a friend and im in my mid twenties but if you consider climb mt hallasan prepare very very well we arrived pretty late since we landed that day and had literally no food this hike was 8 hours for us inexperienced and i swear i was never that close to just fuck it and sleep in a forrest on a mountain because i was done with everything  \\n\\n\\nanyways if you want to go to a buffet restaurant where you can get almost everything seriously its so huge they give you a map go to  marincanto  74 cheongparo yongsangu seoul    74 5  3    approx 30 pp children are cheaper  \\n\\n\\ndont miss out on bbq places since they are really really good didnt had a bad one in 2 weeks also in myeongdong and other places there is a lot seriously a lot streetfood  \\n\\n\\nfor busan all i can say is take your time at the beach enjoy some shaved ice cream and just let go of some stress    \\n\\n\\ni hope this helped a little  also if you have specific questions feel free to ask', 'definitely recommend nami island you can sign up for a guided tour on klook to make getting around the island easier', 'seokguram\\n\\nthe seokguram grotto is a hermitage and part of the bulguksa temple complex it lies four kilometers east of the temple on mt tohamsan in gyeongju south korea it is classified as national treasure no\\n\\n\\n\\n pmhttpswwwredditcommessagecomposetokittensfromspace  exclude mehttpsredditcommessagecomposetowikitextbotmessageexcludemesubjectexcludeme  exclude from
