bussan  \\n\\nthanks in advance and i hope you had a good day \\n'}, {'title': 'broad tips from inexperienced traveler to korea', 'selftext': 'earlier this year i got to spend a few weeks in and around seoul and traveled a little in jeju and busan for the first time this was also my first time out of my home country only knowing the names of a few dishes and very basic korean words hello thank you etc so i caused myself a lot of embarrassment d here are tips many of which came from this subreddit that helped me  \\n\\napps\\n\\nhttpspreviewredditwj19scxbdnld1pngwidth721formatpngautowebpsadfe2b566fe8a6dfb769b48054b721f2c6a0ca20\\n\\n i would recommend downloading these apps picture above \\n\\n i used papago a lot to translate menu items coin laundry instructions etc \\n we used kakao t to order taxis 99 of our taxis were prepaid to go from point a to point b so we didnt have to worry about being upcharged or explain directions that much \\n wowpass had 2 purposes its a korean debit card and has a pass for subways and buses however they both need funds added to them i believe they are also loaded up differently \\n    to add funds that will be used as a debit card there are a few machines to load it up incheon airport theres one near the arex some international hotels big transit stations i believe you can also transfer the funds back into your original account when youre traveling back\\n    to add funds for your public transit pass i usually did it two ways  \\n\\n       theres a list of convenience stores on the app that you can load it up at just ask the cashier to load your tmoney and show them your card and give them how many won you want loaded in it \\n       at some subway stations theres a few kiosks where you can load tmoney up i used my won bills to pay for it as well\\n naver and kakao maps were absolutely essential for navigating especially when youre on foot or tracking on public transit it will tell you which subway line or bus to take and what stationstop to leave on the maps the highly rated places like at least 4345 stars are helpful to find good spots for food and like i used google maps mostly to find places that are more foreigner friendly as in there were positive english reviews of the place especially when i went to get my hair done the salon owner was fluent in english \\n i used kakao bus mostly to check when and what buses were coming to a particular bus stop but usually there is a sign to indicate this \\n\\nmoney\\n\\n keep won bills on you especially if you are going to the street markets and get food or items many vendors have their prices listed and usually only accept cash so having some small bills 1000 and 5000 won were necessary  \\n\\n if you have your debt card you can go to international atms theyre at airports and usually in the walkin area of international banks around seoul there you can get korean won but i had a cap per day of the amount able to be withdrawn and there was a small exchange fee \\n\\n you dont have to tip ie stores or most services \\n\\n if you are spending money at stores go to duty free carry your passport and keep your receipts certain stores offer tax refunds but you need your passport they can be processed once youre back at the airport there were some kiosks to put in your receipts then you take the slip it dispenses to the tax refund desk \\n\\ntransport\\n\\n if possible avoid peak traffic hours on the subway in the morning when people are going to and leaving from work it was unavoidable a couple of times for my travel but over time i wasnt as anxious in a crammed subway car and could mostly freely stand without stumbling not much shoving or body contact despite it everyone mostly keeps to themselves \\n\\n when someone gets off and leaves their open seat in front of you sit quickly lol i had someone immediately squeeze past in front of me to take a seat   \\n\\n when waiting for a bus especially if its crowded have your transport card in hand ready to scan and that you are in line ready to board it once that bus is pulling in at the stop definitely missed a few buses because i didnt have my card ready lol when you are leaving the bus theres a side entrance that opens for the departing passengers while the front door is reserved for the onboarding passengers like boarding you scan your transport card as you exit\\n\\n if you happen to go to gamcheon village beautiful place in busan in those smaller green i think buses prepare yourself for a rocky ride if you dont have seat xd \\n also buses are on time sensitive routes they will most likely start driving as soon as the last person boarding pays so brace a little while you are finding a place to sitstand\\n there are little red buttons to press when youre approaching a stop most of the time there was someone else pressing the stop i wanted to get off at but be aware to not miss it\\n\\nhttpspreviewredditkho48rwrjnld1pngwidth828formatpngautowebps2f2fe7f785034ba6b8f0e87c75c4b701dbdbb05f\\n\\n above is a screenshot of the subway app \\n\\nsubway lines were personally confusing for me but they are very efficient convenient and wellmaintained to go around seoul they are color coded and have two lines going in two different directions there are signs with english translations on which station the stop is heading towards next also on the subway car it has a voiceover and a sign that will announce in english the upcoming station like buses subways are not going to have delays really so i tried to get to the platform before they arrived  \\n\\n there are some restrooms and shops from clothing to convenience and other miscellaneous items in the subway\\n\\netiquette \\n\\n you dont have to hold the doors for other people or be overly friendly in general as long as you are not too loud in public and on transit people tend not to notice \\n\\n everyone follows the street lights to cross intersections and streets \\n\\n do not order togo or carryout and sit downloiter in the store if you want to sit down please say youre eatingdrinking in the store when an employee asks most of the time for togo orders the staff have to give you portable containers for your items rather than glasses or dishes reserved for sitdown customers\\n\\n some sit down cafes will have a return station it could just have a counter or rack to put the finished tray and items on andor have a small disposal area for certain items youve eaten\\n\\n this may seem obvious but do not pick up pose and take pictures with fruitsitems you havent purchased from small vendors i saw a group of tourists do this to a man in jeju and he was not amused to say the least    \\n\\n sometimes people will stare especially older folks however because i pass as korean it did not affect me much on public transit its not very loud and i saw most people stare at their phone or the floor in front of them  \\n\\nlanguage \\n\\n definitely learn how to say basic korean words like please thank you sorry excuse me this and numbers up to like 5 probably you will need to use them like when ordering food or purchasing items \\n\\n maybe not as necessary but if you like certain drinks or food i would learn how to say them in korean  \\n\\ntime\\n\\n there are certain days off and holidays just be mindful when you are planning to go out for the day that the place you are going to isnt closed\\n\\n breakfast may be tricky since a lot of places are not open until 10001100 am but if you are need a snack drink or random things the convenience stores in korea are the best \\n\\nfoods\\n\\n delivery apps like coupang is great for trying out different foods without any pressure to order but i believe you need a korean number to order \\n\\n gwangjang market and similar markets where multiple vendors sell the same type of thing in my opinion do not have the best korean foods however theyre were not bad there are better food vendors at these markets other markets you kind of have to find them though usually therell be a line of koreans lol\\n\\nother\\n\\n there are bidets on some toilets and a few places dont like to flush toilet paper down because of weak water pressure and a have bin for its disposal so prepare to use a bidet lol\\n\\n there are a lot of stairs if you are using the subway frequently keep to the right side unless you are in a rush\\n\\n clothing stores generally dont have bigger sizes but i went to the main flagship romistory store which carried kind of basic feminine clothing that is more korean style i went there twice and wish i could go back lol \\n\\n if you love korean makeup skincare etc oh my god there are so many oliveyoungs in seoul im talking two on one street or across from each other it is much cheaper buying in korea than global sites and they have sales and promotions on usually on offer   \\n\\n'},

could not wait to go back once restrictions started to lift ive been there three times and have honed in on some general tips that i hope are helpful to this sub\\n\\nbackground i visited seoul in may 2019 and then again in october 2019 i just came back from a 15 day trip in september split between seoul third time and busan first time i used to travel frequently for both business and leisure especially to asia so theres very little culture shock anymore im a mid30s woman from la who looks korean but does not speak the language which earned me a lot of disappointed looks \\n\\nnot going to cover covidrelated entryexit tips given how quickly those have evolved this year all i will say is this the man who performed my swab touched a place inside me i didnt know existed and i never want to feel again \\n\\ntravel\\n\\n purchase a tmoney or cashbee card when you land at the airport for public transportation funds both cards work in seoul and busan across subways and busses youll need cash to top off the cards public transportation is cheap clean and efficient in both seoul and busan\\n dont bother with a wifi egg everywhere has wifi i have a google pixel and googlefi so i didnt need to go anything once landing but others have recommended getting a sim card at the airport \\n kakao taxi came in clutch given the language barrier enter the address and request a ride you can use kakao t without a korean number just select the option to pay after the ride uber exists but pales in comparison \\n taxi light colors are reversed if you see a taxi with a red light on that means its vacant green is occupied or reserved and blue is off duty \\n download kakao or naver for food and directions not google due to data mapping privacy some addresses in google are straight up inaccurate\\n unless youre traveling during chuseok you can purchase ktx tickets the day of edit ive been corrected try to buy tickets ahead of timeyou can go to a ktx station and purchase in person for a future date if you run into online credit card issues like i did no need to splurge on first classits not worth it\\n plenty of luggage storage at essentially every subway station but almost all hotels will hold your bags for you at check out \\n\\nlanguage\\n\\n use a translation app like papago or google translate to get the hangul of what youre looking for and then plug that into kakao or naver for recommendations for example typing in bossam didnt net any decent result but  did \\n i found that papago is better for written translations whereas google translate is better for speechtotranscribe we ended up making fast friends with some older gentleman at a pocha one night in busan using only papago google translate and increasingly exaggerated hand gestures thanks to soju to communicate \\n i used the google translate lens to translate menus not the most amazing translations but i got enough of the gist to order \\n seoul speaks and understands far more english than busan \\n dont be a shitasslearn some basic korean some helpful phrases\\n    annyeong haseyo  hello\\n    gamsahamnida  thank you\\n    ne  yes\\n    aniyo  no\\n    yeongeo halsu isseoyo  can you speak english\\n    mian hamnida  sorry\\n    du myeong iyo  two people\\n    yeogiyo  jogiyo  here  there to get attention in a restaurant\\n    masisseoyo  delicious\\n that being said korean romanization is confusing in korean s is pronounced as the sh sound so masisseoyo  mahsheesohyo the first time i visited it took 5 min for my cab driver to understand i wanted to go to sinsadong because i didnt pronounce it shinsadong wish i had kakaotaxi that time korean sounds best if youre basically speedrunning through the phrase \\n\\nfood  drinks  activities\\n\\n most businesses and restaurants dont open until 11am at the earliest some dont open until 56pm seoul comes to life at night if you find yourself up early go get a bowl of soup found that theres a strong overlap between 24h restaurants and seollungtung spots a coffee and stroll through seoul forest park or gyeongbokgung palace which open earlier in the morning \\n if youre staying at a hotel ask concierge to help book reservations i really wanted to try the hanwoo beef omakase in the basement speakeasy of born  bred but they only took reservations over the phone in korean and spots fill up about a month in advance i emailed ryse hotel in hongdae a week before my flight and they helped me secure a reservation within hours \\n so much turnover for businesses in korea dont be disappointed if a place is gone or operating hours have changed from whats posted online which is often time not entirely accurate i stumbled into an amazing vinyl bar during my first trip to seoul in may 2019 when i returned five months later it was gone during this most recent trip i looked up a highly rated soondubu restaurant in busan that had reviews as recent as two months prior but found a fresh pile of rubble upon arrival \\n unless youre going to a western style cocktail bar you will likely need to order food with your drinks this is called anju some places only require one dish for the table but others especially pochas expect you to order one dish per person on the plus side these businesses arent in the practice of quickly turning over tables so you can hang and munch for a while\\n pochas and food stalls only take cash most other restaurants take card had no issue with visa but ive seen amex cause problems \\n nachos just mean tortilla chips youll see nachos and cheese on some pub menus dont order it \\n sweet onion powder is inexplicably on everything including nachos  \\n\\nmiscellaneous\\n\\n if youre looking for a toilet just go to any subway station plentiful and decently clean \\n carry tissues and hand sanitizer at all times many bathrooms lacked soap or had communal soap bars hork \\n korea is incredibly safe people leave their cell phones and purses when going to the restroom or to reserve seats i even saw a rolex on a bar stool when someone stepped outside for a smoke with that being said dont be carelessyoure still in a big city \\n stand on the right side of the escalator step to the left side if youre walking updown \\n despite the level of organization and efficiency for escalators this is not the case for sidewalks its a chaotic game of chicken and youll run into at least half a dozen people who dont bother to look up from their phones \\n\\nhappy to give some cityspecific recommendations if anyone is interested i generally avoid major tourist attractions like n seoul tower and lotte world unless theres some other interesting draw im food and drink motivated and dont care for clubbing but love a good nightlife'}, {'title': 'must know for

for\\xa0magicka\\xa0and made it a carbon copy of so many other titles\\n4 as the game went live on steam a huge number of people bought it the first day the number of severe bugs and crashes became painfully obvious  to the point that a problemfree game of\\xa0magicka\\xa0became a joke\\n5 due to our milestone plan we had this mentality of having to pull together this mentality resulted in not only our actually pulling together but also our shunning existing technology putting too much effort in things that didnt matter and just plain grinding  mmo style\\n6 we instead took it upon ourselves to work overtime for several consecutive weeks to catch up for previous misjudgments and attempt to reach new impossible milestones\\n7 unfortunately we didnt have a plan at least not a plan that had any reasonable way of tracking how we were doing where we were or how much we had left all that existed was a timeline on the whiteboard with numbered weeks associated with levels and features if a level slipped past the week to which it was assigned we would just consider it good enough  even though it was missing crucial gameplay features\\n8 sometimes in the middle of development we realized the game was nowhere as fun as it had been in the prototype stages and not even close to what we aimed for the first time we had experienced such a problem doubt filled the

all the mines in a minefield and we still like some sort of imbeciles were compelled to step on them\\n10 this tendency of having to experience mistakes before learning from them kept haunting us

this on top of all the quiet quitting and lying flat people i met who are just giving up and not looking for steady work several parents told me how the old cushy government jobs for grads are drying up because cities are all teetering on bankruptcy due to the growthatallcosts spending and debt of the past 20 years\\n\\nsecond these shady fucks are not reporting unemployed migrant workers from rural areas theres got to be millions of these people i thought migrants were reported after the ccp revamped their labor reporting standards in 2019 but the business owners and university faculty i

across the street waiting for trucks and vans to drive up looking for cheap labor shit was wild there would be literally fistfights over who would pile into each truck reminded me of the honduran mexican and salvadorian migrants back in dallas who line up near home depots looking for day work sans violence the day labor dudes i talked to in those mobs in chengdu and beijing were almost all former construction workers who are now doing day work or gig jobs because all the construction jobs are gone thanks to the imploding real estate market see evergrande bankruptcy they told me the day labor crowds were easily 3x bigger right after covid but the work was so rare that folks packed up and returned to their villages when they ran out of money multiple that a couple hundred times who knows how many unemployed ppl arent being counted\\n\\nanother big problem no one is talking about that i noticed  china made working construction over 50 illegal so now theres millions up on millions

story\\n\\nupdate 113 \\nhes still in korean and confirmed to have claimed that comfort women were prostitutes also its been noted the drug charge in itself is 10 years so the combined sentence if found guilty could well be over 10 years latest updatehttpsyoutubeaux5lwqjewsivmfx2naxbtef8jd4 also heres the big fight everyone is talking about the big fight between johnny somalianother racist vs korean streamershttpswwwyoutubecomlivek2jdbtqxylgsiue3dpl99gvhjzen6 also the deep fake charges were apparently him trying to prove he had a korean girlfriend or some kind of fling happening so he was using an ai to portray that illusion hence the deep fake charge its not sexual deep fake charge that koreas been seeing lately in the news but its still a deep fake so he will still probably be charged with the same law also apparently the girl is an accomplice httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxkzcdjux2eu the han river part was real but we may not know the full story regardless shes suing under the deep fake law so even if shes lying its most likely the court will still rule in favor of her weird but the police are investigating this charge httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxesrpkxuwoo this is more about who the girl in the video is basically johnny you have a lot of charges\\n\\n\\nfor people saying he already fled the country no he didnt theres no travel record indicating he left the country hes still in korea currently so called bounty hunters are trying to locate his whereabouts meanwhile the korean authorities are still probing into his deep fake charge as they have a key witness  sufficient evidence to build a case against him confirmed charges are ai deepfake charge  obstruction of business  disturbance of peace charge drug  assault  sexual harrassment charges are still pending investigation\\n\\nupdate 114\\nkorean parliament reviewed the johnny somali streams including the comfort women one one member described it as devastating and another as damaging the reputation of korea most parliament members agreed with the sentiment that his streams have severly damaged koreas reputation a member said that a swift action needs to be taken to discourage other potential tourists from ever doing the similar actions\\n\\nadditionally more korean youtube streamers as well as even more netizens have teamed up this morning to hunt johnny there was a conference today that was broadcasted amongst the original streamers who were involved in the scuffle apologizing for their violent act because this isnt the side of korea they want to show to the international world they seem committed to still search for johnny but in the meantime they have filed a complaint to the korean government for failing to act towards the national interest there is also widespread criticism amonst korean online cafes toward the government for failing to act\\n\\ncurrently there are two different korean mafia groups actively searching for johnny while one is unconfirmed one that is confirmed is from the seongbuk district near the miari area who are asking citizens who have seen him to call a number for a cash reward the exact amount as well as the nature of the reward is unknown they are currently outsourcing their search work to try to find him as well as his friend hank they dont want interaction with the police so if the police do find him first its presumed they probably wont take further action\\n\\nhe was rumoured to have been staying at his friends hank apartment a lone streamer searching for johnny said he heard both johnny and hanks voice in the apartment and the streamer and his friends are currently staking out to see the latest development this is unconfirmed as of now httpswwwyoutubecomwatchviwszdcd0fak\\n\\nsexual harrassment charges are confirmed as police have acquired the video of him and his friends asking korean girls two of them being minors if they can perform sexual acts i will not say in detail what he said because quite frankly its quite disgusting  one of it was even streamed live during one of his broadcast while the other was a report that was filed the authenticity of the video is still be tested by digital crimes division police are also in the process of obtaining cctv footages of areas johnny has streamed to see events that have transpired this has been confirmed\\n\\nas for the deepfake charge that charge may not dropped even though the original suer has expressed that she no longer wishes to press charges httpsxcomteamftofficialstatus1853404933040599507 she did press charges originally this from her stream doing so httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv1j6cme1gzgo the reason why the charges may noe be dropped is because of the revised law in september 26 of this year which states that regardless of purposes productions and distribution of synthetic materials can still be punished not confirmed if the charges will be dropped but he has a lot more to worry about than the deepfake particularly the drug and sexual harrassment charges \\n\\nbecause a lot of johnnys foreign friends are not in korea it is possible that hank and johnny are the only ones out of their team that are still in korea hank is confirmed to be a bisexual pedophile who admitted to paying young korean boys to have sex in the past its being guessed amongst seachers that the police do know where johnny and his friend is staying but they are not going to release the information to the public for johnnys safety also previously i was unable to verify that his passport was actually confiscated but its been confirmed his passport was confiscated when the mokpo police took him into custody this also confirms the initial claim that he has not left korea even though he claims he did he is still in korea hiding out as of this time he has raised 22 cents through ebegging \\n\\n114 update\\nwow im honestly updating so much on this degen because hes just doing too much hes now confirmed to have claimed theres no dokdo island he said its takeshima island also for people dming for video of him saying comfort women are prositutes here is the clip httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvi0xzjpdcbsy \\n\\n115 update\\nso theres been some other updates a lot of seoul taxi drivers are aware of johnny and his actions and theres a common agreement to not give him ride or to report him to the police if they do give him a ride was riding a taxi and we were discussing with the driver about the johnny case and he said yes we all know him he shouldnt be doing that in our country we were just talking about him yesterday at the  taxi driver restraunt and also another group of nonstreamers actively looking for him its a group of former  korean marine corp members they were spotted near a park in mokpo asking passing civilians if theyve seen johnny theres a few other small groups and a common sentiment is that the police is protecting johnny by not revealing his location assuming the police know about johnnys whereabouts\\n\\n1110 update\\nhttpsyoutubexspa9wcvltesikkjn56qkcatvoxv\\nit is not up to but definitely over 10 years in prison\\n obstruction of business disturbance of peace assault drug charges and sexual harrassment of minors are what he is being charged with  under investigation for he is currently in the no fly list still despite reports saying he already left  hes also been hit with multiple trespassing charges as well as an additional charge for vandalism of public property there is also a harrassment charge when he made rather degrading remarks to a woman while on public transit the apology although received nicely by the korean public doesnt change the course of action the police and prosecution will take most have seen what he did in japan and there is widespread criticism of korean streamers who met up with him to discuss the apology and seemingly accepting it \\n\\nthere was no mention of dropping the deepfake charge so the police and prosecution is still looking into it the victim has reportedly stopped pursuing the case\\n\\n1111 update\\ndespite johnnys insisting that he hasnt been charged with assault and threatening legal actions if posts like these arent taken down he has been confirmed to have been charged for assault hes also been charged with obstruction of business and to top it off he is still being investigated for all the other charges mentioned above korean nonstreamers are still hunting for him even coining the term golden goblin to describe johnny\\n\\n1112 edit\\nhttpswwwseattlencomfocus19053googlevignette\\njust when you thought it couldnt get worse hes being investigated for stalking a streamer reported johnny for stalking no official charges yet as police is still conducting investigation also for people asking when he will be arrested he has been summoned by the prosecution office on charge of obstruction of business other charges could follow soon httpswwwkadonetnewsarticleviewhtmlidxno1275722\\n\\nfinal edit\\nhes been formally indicted with obstruction of business which is sentence of at most 5 years however he wont likely get the 5 years but instead a lighter sentence likely up to 2 years since the store wasnt damaged where there were financial repurcussions like how usually a 5 year sentence is given if he gets a sentence could most likely be a fine if anything if he pleas guilty and shows repentance the deep fake charge is most likely going to be dropped because the victim is no longer pursuing the charge hes still under investigation of sexual harrassment of minors assault and disturbance of peace there was no mention of drug charges as of yesterday evening by both police stations \\nhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv7s8qsuudtog\\nthe thing with korea is they have a 90 success rate when it comes to convictions basically johnnys screwed it doesnt seem like he will be facing the 10 year sentence that was previously reported in multiple news outlets but he will most likely be facing jail time andor hefty fine during his jailtime the prosecution could indict him on other charges once those investigations are concluded \\nfunny thing is johnny somali asked police to help because he was getting beaten up and the police went to his location and concluded he wasnt beaten up even those theres clips circulating the beating up  httpsyoutubebadsa66pnjmsifqu8zu2g8p1ns3p3\\nalso i dont know why this got removed this is johnny and his friends being a predator httpsyoutubekkdxqjuxa0siwmsnowwdywn4kwgn'}, {'title': 'visiting korea

sergei kiriyenko putins first deputy chief of staff two of the officials said what the two talked about isnt clear\\n\\nlast month the us justice department said in an affidavit that kiriyenko had created some 30 internet domains to spread russian disinformation including on musks x where it was meant to erode support for ukraine and manipulate american voters ahead of the presidential election \\n\\nafter the russian invasion in february 2022 musk at first made strong public statements of support for kyiv he posted hold strong ukraine flanked by ukrainian flags on what was then still known as twitter shortly after he jokingly challenged putin to oneonone combat over  the ukrainian language name for the country\\n\\nhe followed up by donating several hundred starlink terminals to ukraine by july some 15000 terminals were providing free internet access to broad swaths of the country destroyed by the russian attacks\\n\\nlater that year musks view of the conflict appeared to change in september ukrainian military operatives werent able to use starlink terminals to guide sea drones to attack a russian naval base in crimea the black sea peninsula moscow had occupied since 2014 ukraine tried to persuade musk to activate the starlink service in the area but that didnt happen the journal has reported\\n\\nhis space company extended restrictions on the use of starlink in offensive operations by ukraine musk said later that he made the move because starlink is meant for civilian uses and that he believed any ukrainian attack on crimea could spark a nuclear war\\n\\nhis moves coincided with public and private pressure from the kremlin in may 2022 russias space chief said in a post on telegram that musk would answer like an adult for supplying starlink to ukraines azov battalion which the kremlin had singled out for the ultraright ideology espoused by some members\\n\\nlater in 2022 musk was having regular conversations with highlevel russians according to a person familiar with the interactions at the time there was pressure from the kremlin on musks businesses and implicit threats against him the person said \\n\\nat the same time musk increasingly took to twitter for which he was completing the purchase to say spacex was losing money by funding the operation of the terminals   in october 2022 he asked his tens of millions of followers on x to vote on a pathway to peace that mirrored some aspects of the kremlins offer to ukraine at the time\\n\\nthose conditions included continued russian occupation of crimea and ukrainian neutrality outside of nato he also specified that ukraine should continue allowing the supply of water to crimea an issue that had been an important concern of the kremlin before the war one current and one former

message from putin that russia would secure crimea and ukrainian neutrality no matter what and that it would respond to a ukrainian invasion of crimea with a nuclear strike musk said that everything needed to be done to avoid that outcome bremmer wrote\\n\\nmusk has publicly denied he said any of those things to bremmer\\n\\nin the past year musk and russias interests have increasingly overlapped apart from russias use of x for disinformation and musks outspoken opposition to aid to kyiv ukrainian officials said earlier this year that russian forces occupying the countrys eastern and southern swaths had started using starlink to enable secure communications and extend the range of their drones \\n\\nrussian troops also began using starlink terminals brought in through third countries at a massive scale undermining one of ukraines few battlefield advantages musk has said on x that to the best of his knowledge no terminals had been sold directly or indirectly to russia and that the terminals wouldnt work inside russia \\n\\npentagon officials have said the military was working with ukraine and starlink to address the issue and described spacex as a great partner in those efforts people familiar with the situation have said controlling who is using starlink in ukraine is difficult \\n\\nstarlink has said on x that when spacex learns of claims that unauthorized parties are using the service it investigates and can cut off access earlier this year musk gave airtime to putin and his views on the us and ukraine when x carried tucker carlsons twohour interview with the russian leader inside the kremlin in that interview putin said he was sure musk was a smart person\\n\\ntheres no stopping elon musk hes going to do what he thinks he needs to do putin said you need

russian intelligence officer briefed on the situation the request was done as a favor to china he said whom russia was increasingly relying on for trade and to get around sanctions a representative of the chinese embassy in washington said they werent aware of the specifics and couldnt comment \\n\\nstarlink has never secured permission to offer internet service in taiwan whose government places restrictions on nontaiwanese satellite operators \\n\\ntaiwan is currently listed as coming soon on a starlink map of where it provides service  as the year progressed musk became more preoccupied with the presidential election\\n\\nthrough the first months of the year musk said he would refrain from backing any presidential candidate while at the same time holding private conversations discussing how he could get trump elected musk publicly endorsed him in july the businessman said he planned to commit as much as 45 million a month to a new super politicalaction committee in part to get it done according to people familiar with the matter the effort included hiring armies of canvassers to scour battleground states for voters\\n\\nsince then trump has said he intends to make musk

stores\\n\\nhonestly i preferred japanese convenience stores over korean experience stores there are way more proper meal options in japan for example theres a dessert fridge for puddings crepes and cakes which i used to always buy during my trip in japan but in korean convenience stores theres hardly any \\n\\nif you like ramen korean convenience stores can align more to your taste as there are more options \\n\\nthat said korean convenience stores are really expensive water was like 23 usd for a large bottle while in japan its 1 usd a hotel staff told me not to buy stuff from convenience stores and go to local supermarkets instead as it was way too overpriced \\n\\ni used to use my ic card all in japan for food when im lazy but i hardly buy anything in korean convenience  stores due to the lack of options \\nic card talk will be explained in more detail in the next point \\n\\nthat said if you like ramen korean convenience stores can align more to your taste as there are more options \\n\\nic cards\\n\\njapan ic cards are way more valuable than korean ic cards i have bought tickets for museums and other sites using ic cards compared to koreas t money card i could be wrong but i have yet to see its use elsewhere \\n\\nfood delivery \\n\\nprobably one of the biggest gripes i have in korea is the lack of delivery apps for foreigners\\n\\nin japan you can use uber eats and i had 0 problems with it where as korea locks it to koreans only for no damn reason \\n\\ntransport \\n\\ntransport is fairly similar but id give it heads up to korea korea doesnt have private rail which can make it was less confusing compared to japanese rail \\n\\n\\nwhen i first arrived in japan i took a while to figure how to use japans rail system since it was so overwhelming \\n\\ntaxis are also way cheaper in korea than japan \\ni remember forking out 70 dollars from dotonburi to my hotel in osaka \\n\\ntourist sites \\n\\nthis can be controversial due to japan and koreas war time but i feel like korea lacks a lot of cultural sites \\n\\ni like to see a lot of cultural sites and museums and japan has a lot of that but korea doesnt have as much and most of the touristy stuff can be done in a span of a day \\n\\ni am korean so i know that a lot of the cultural sites were destroyed due to war etc but im just saying it as a tourist point of view \\n\\nhotels and facilities\\n\\nkorean hotels rooms tend to be larger than japanese hotels japanese hotels tend to have bathtub shower attachments in 1 to account for its small room size to be fair though i have grown quite fond of the japanese styles and dont mind it as much as before \\n\\nfrom the hotels i have been to japanese hotels has better facilities such as laundry rooms and vending machines i have yet to see a laundry room like japan in korea korea offers its own laundry service where washing a t shirt costs 10 usd \\n\\nfrom my experience as a solo traveller japan hotels are the way to go especially for the laundry rooms\\n\\nhotels in seoul is way more expensive than tokyo by the difference for 100200 for a 3 star hotel \\nmake sure you bring a lot of money if you want to stay in korea imo \\n\\netiquette\\n\\njapan lives to bow and i kind of live that it makes me feel more welcome compared to korea thats not to say korea is rude as ive seen nice korean grandmas asking me to sit down and young people giving seats to the elderly\\n\\nthe bowing especially when in hotels trains etc really makes you feel welcome while in korea they just dont look or look away \\n\\nsmell \\n\\nhonestly it might sound rude but i am korean and i know the smell since i was a kid \\n\\nsome korean places have bad sewage smell \\ni have experienced this in gyeongju it could have been a one off thing but i do have that ptsd \\n\\nfood \\n\\nnow this can depend on personal preference \\nwhen i first went to japan 4 years ago i didnt like the food because it was too salty and lacked the flavour compared to korean after my recent and current trip in korea i can say that koreas new generation of food is abit off putting with all the sugar for example i went to isaac toast because youtubers were ranting about it and after trying it today i can say that it is overrated it was overwhelmingly sweet with the sauce eggs and pickles \\n\\nthat said traditional korean food is the way to go for the authentic taste \\n\\nalso from my recent illness i can say that foreigners should stay away from raw seafood especially oysters and clams in korea i got norovirus from it and was throwing up and having diarrhoea for 2 days \\n\\njapan has a lot of cheap bentos such as a 1kg tonkatsu meal for 1213 usd \\n\\njapan also seem to have more options for food in restaurants for solo travellers compared to korea \\n\\n\\nhonestly i feel bored in korea right now but i might be because im just tired of travelling now and i miss my bed and my cat \\n\\nfeel free to ask questions if i have left things out'}, {'title': 'is korea safe for a solo female traveller', 'selftext': 'my girlfriend is thinking of going to south korea seoul for a month through her university to study a small

used as an english tutor under the alias of yoon bong soo this case has always interested me and its a shame its not received more attention there is a good podcast episode id recommend the two part series by unknown passage podcast and also the thin air podcast where they brought along davids father on air  \\n\\n\\nmr sneddon then a 24 year old student at brigham young university in utah disappeared in august 2004 while hiking in the tiger leaping gorge in chinas yunnan province fluent in korean and speaking some chinese he was sightseeing before heading home to utah and graduate school after finishing a twoyear mission for his church in south korea\\n\\nthe local chinese authorities first informed us officials and the sneddon family that david had most likely fallen into the river and drowned to death while hiking through the gorge however the familys own investigation soon afterward confirmed that david had finished his trek and been seen in a restaurant beyond the end of the gorge\\n\\nhis disappearance immediately thereafter was not explained although a number of factors indicated a north korean connection first north korean agents were actively operating in the area at the time with the acquiescence of chinese officials detaining north korean \\ndefectors and their suspected supporters second charles r jenkins a us soldier who deserted to north korea in 1965 and was used by the regime to teach english to north korean officials and agents left north korea one month before davids disappearance davids youth and fluency in english and korean would have made him particularly appealing as a replacement candidate third japanese specialists on north korea affiliated with the national association for the rescue of japanese kidnapped by north korea narkn obtained information from reliable sources in china that in august 2004 an american student closely matching davids description was detained by chinese authorities who were observed to release him into the hands of \\nnorth korean agents\\n\\nin september last year the us and uk media quoted mr choi to report that mr sneddon turned up alive in north korea after being kidnapped to serve as kim jong uns personal english tutor in august 2004 while he was traveling yunnan province china since then both the senate and the house of representatives of the us passed a resolution urging action to find out what happened to sneddon north korea strongly denied kidnapping him\\nit is said that the us embassy has been requested mr choi the current state of mr sneddon and further information to decisively confirm his identity up until now according to north korean sources sneddon has been relocated to mt myohyang and is under special surveillance after foreign press reports and was spotted at the chosun red cross hospital and pongsu church in pyongyan before being relocated\\naccording to choi sources in north korea told him that then north korean leader kim jong il made a special order in 2004 to find a tutor to teach english and american culture to his children sources also said that the overseas political dissident division of the state security department and staffs deployed to myanmar kidnapped sneddon and brought him to pyongyang in october 2004\\nnow mr sneddon goes by the korean name yoon bong soo and he is married to a woman named kim eun hae and they have two children a boy and a girl mr choi argued that such a story was revealed by a person who was involved in the kidnapping of mr sneddon and he confessed mr chois north korean source before he was dead\\n\\nthey have met with a multitude of ngos human rights advocates japanese government officials  who are convinced david is a victim of kidnapping by the hermit state\\n\\nour latest information on davids case points to davids likely abduction by elements of the democratic peoples republic of korea north korea says a post from august last year we believe he is now being held captive there\\n\\nthe sneddons are bruised by the lack of interest from the us department of state which maintains there is not credible evidence david was abducted they presume their story doesnt fit the narrative the department wants for uschina relations\\n\\nthe credible evidence david was drowned in the gorge was the chinese said thats what happened says roy\\n\\ntheyve never really investigated a lot of material adds kathleen they may have been investigating it privately thats my hope that theyre silently working on it\\n\\nher husband is less patient if youre suddenly thrown off a ship and pray a dolphin will come and give you a ride youre probably best off to start swimming yourself says roy\\n\\nwe decided wed try swimming ourselves theres so much politics its difficult\\n\\nkathleen trusts her son is probably safe for now but her eyes are wide open to the dangers and she sees clear reasons why their son might not have been able to contact them for all these years\\n\\nif kim jongun didnt like david anymore hed be killed she says the internet is absolutely closed in north korea some people may have access to a phone from china but he probably doesnt want to jeopardise himself and his wife and children\\n\\nif any one of our children had to be abducted and cope with a difficult situation its david he has great personal belief on the inside hes very strong\\n\\ni just want to run up to him hug him and get to know his wife and children\\n\\ndespite their desperation to see their son again the sneddons have also found room in their hearts to feel deeply for the north korean people its such an evil and repressive empire says kathleen i hope david is freed and something happens and these people will be freed\\n\\nas they watch the pressure on north korea increase over its repressive regime and nuclear testing they wonder if their adjustable son could even play a vital role in a transition\\n\\nid like to think in the long run david could be a blessing to the people of north korea says kathleen i hope david can move mountains she laughs were both dreamers\\n\\nroy interjects i dont think we are i believe kim jonguns regime will fall it wont happen because the us sends an

the first elevator is a decoy dont take it  then another elevator will open up and there are all the missing floors at least when i was there they change it if you press the button nothing happens so

educationhttpswiadomoscionetpllodzrobertlewandowskimalewamagisterkepilkarzmialzdacegzaminynaktorychgoniepmjz614 heres translation\\n\\nrobert lewandowski was supposed to do his bachelors and masters degrees in secret from the world at a university in d linked to a scientist suspected of trading in diplomas now new information is coming to light  i have not seen him in front of my eyes during my exams yet from the documents i was shown during the interrogation it appears that he passed my subject twice  barbara mrozinska a sociologist from d who was previously linked to the university where the captain of the polish national team was supposed to get his diploma tells onet\\n\\nrobert lewandowski captain of the polish national football team and striker of the famous barcelona had his higher education for 13 years this is according to official information that he himself has made public it is known that he started his studies as a 19yearold in 2007 and only after ten years in 2017 he obtained his bachelors degree in turn he defended his masters thesis in 2020 which was quickly reported by the national media he obtained both of these diplomas in warsaw at the college of education in sport this education is not disputed by anyone\\n\\nhowever two other diplomas were issued in the name of the famous footballer a bachelors and a masters degree he was to obtain them at a private university in d in great secrecy from the world he would defend his masters degree during a video conference during adam nawakas 2018 national team training camp in addition both diplomas would be awarded while he was laboriously studying at the aforementioned university in warsaw where let us remind you it took him as long as 13 years to study\\n\\ncould it be that the famous polish footballer had so much time to pull two courses of study at two different universities in d and warsaw in between his numerous matches training sessions business activities and private life\\n\\nour source in law enforcement familiar with the backstory of the diploma affair in which lewandowskis name appears indicates that after lewy got his diplomas in d without studying the footballer chickened out and never made them public\\n\\n the driving force behind robert getting his diplomas in d quickly and painlessly was supposed to be his wife ania she wanted her husband after he started his studies in warsaw in 2007 and was unable to finish them for years to nevertheless have a higher education and be able to go to a coaching school for example in the future the opportunity to get the diplomas became an acquaintance with zbigniew d a scholar from d and also a football activist who was known in the sports community for being able to arrange among other things certificates from the university of which he was the chancellor our informant points out\\n\\n robert received both diplomas from d through connections but at some point realised that lies have short legs and precautionarily never showed these papers off after all it would look strange if it turned out that he had been studying in warsaw for 13 years with all his sweat and all of a sudden he got two diplomas in d the upshot was that he legally completed the studies he had long ago started in warsaw and the diplomas from d were to remain a big secret to a small group of people argues an onet source in law enforcement agencies\\n\\n the former chancellor and the secrets of his phone\\n\\nthe mystery of lewandowskis d degrees has finally come to light by accident as we wrote in onet in 2019 the police arrested zbigniew d a scientist from d in the act in the past which is not insignificant in this story he was a football activist of ks d he met many famous athletes in fact one of his sons played football competitively later he and his wife did their habilitation in slovakia which still raises questions in the scientific community in d\\n\\nfive years ago zbigniew d fell for trying to sell a diploma from the university of which he was the chancellor  this was the now defunct university of health education and social sciences wsezins in d he fell during a police provocation  he wanted to sell the diploma to a woman who was honest and had previously reported the matter to the police officers detained the scientist secured his phone at the time and discovered surprising information in it\\n\\nit turned out that several years ago zbigniew d had been in a lively correspondence with anna lewandowska and with other athletes and their representatives he had talked to them about supplementing their education\\n\\namong other things a copy of a masters degree in pedagogy issued to robert lewandowski with the signature of the rector of the d university  zbigniew ds wife  was found at the scientist from d in 2019\\n\\nalso found were documents issued in the name of jacek gralski former polish national team player a copy of his identity card a secondary school certificate and a bachelors degree in adventist theology supposedly issued by a private university from near warsaw this bachelors degree would be defended by gralski with an 55 in october 2017 on the day of adam nawakas national teams qualifying match against montenegro poland won 42 with gralski watching the entire match from the substitutes bench\\n\\na copy of the matura diplom for arkadiusz milik translated into italian and english was also found\\n\\ngralski and milik later denied that they had received any diplomas through zbigniew d\\n\\nthe d university wsezins at which lewandowski was supposed to have obtained his bachelors degree and of which zbigniew d was chancellor no longer exists the university of social sciences uns has been operating at the same address in d for years  zbigniew d became a lecturer there his wife was the rector and his son first became the chancellor and now serves as rector it was at uns which was started to be managed by the closest family of the suspected exchancellor that lewy would continue his education in d and complete his masters degree and it was this university that after our 2021 texts sued onet and the author of this text\\n\\nthe d university of social sciences is demanding an apology from us a donation of pln 30000 to a social cause and argues that robert lewandowski is its graduate and that he obtained his diplomas in lodz in a legal manner\\n\\nare we sure\\n\\n lewandowski was supposed to pass two exams with me i have not seen him with my eyes\\n\\nunexpectedly a few days ago dr barbara mroziska spoke out on this issue she is a sociologist from d and the head of a private television station as it turns out she has recently been questioned by investigators from gdask who have been explaining the diploma affair involving zbigniew d since 2019 and in which the names of leading polish footballers are mentioned\\n\\nrobert lewandowski bought his diploma at a private university in d i write this with full responsibility because he passed two exams with me i found out about everything during my interrogation as a witness in this disgusting case  dr barbara mroziska wrote on the x platform\\n\\nwe called her as she pointed out the matter is public and she spoke up on platform x out of a sense of decency on the grounds that many of her students had to work hard to get a degree first to come at weekends to take parttime classes and then to pass the notsoeasy exams with her\\n\\ndr mroziska taught social research methodology at the now defunct college of health education and social sciences of which zbigniew d was chancellor\\n\\nwith her entry and statements for onet the sociologist refutes the version of the d university that the captain of the national football team legally obtained two diplomas at the university\\n\\nbarbara mroziska told us that she had never seen lewandowski either in classes or in exams and she would have to have seen if he was in fact her student meanwhile at an interview last month she found out that she was supposed to have examined the famous footballer and twice during his undergraduate and graduate studies\\n\\nevery time the lewy was supposed to get threes with her maybe because she had a lot of demands on her students in the online documents next to the grades in her subjects her signature was not present it is not known who entered these grades into the electronic system behind her back instead dr mroziska kept paper attendance records for her classes she never recorded the attendance of student robert lewandowski\\n\\naccording to the electronic entries that dr mroziska saw at other lecturers in d the striker had better grades including fours plus and fives\\n\\n if he had taken an exam with me he would have had to come to me meanwhile his grade card showed that he passed two subjects with me which was definitely not the case i would remember such a wellknown student emphasises barbara mroziska\\n\\n lewys former manager version about d diplomas sounds ridiculous\\n\\nin an interview with onet the sociologist did not want to prejudge whether lewy had arranged or bought a diploma for himself or whether someone from the d university as a gift had decided to give him first his bachelors degree and then his masters degree she does not want to expose himself to a lawsuit she points out however that the latter version that the diplomas were arranged behind the footballers back or that someone forced them on him is highly unlikely\\n\\nshe also admitted that she once heard from students at a d university that lewandowski had come to collect a diploma at the time she took it as a joke\\n\\nlewandowskis dz diplomas are also not believed by his former manager and now opponent in various criminal and civil cases it is referring to cezary kucharski who has been on the warpath with the footballer for several years\\n\\n for me it is unbelievable that in the time i was his manager he would do some diplomas in lodz he had no time for his family and sponsors during his visits to poland so how would he find time for some secret teaching in d it sounds ridiculous when we were still working together i knew his every step in poland we would set his calendar when he was in the country all i knew was that he was completing his education in warsaw that official ba he wrote about himself  rl9 the road to fame was printed and bound by an employee of our office robert did not do anything in poland without our knowledge so he certainly did not travel to d for lectures and exams cezary kucharski tells onet\\n\\n difficult questions for the lewandowski family\\n\\nwhen we were collecting material for the first text on the graduation affair in 2021 we called anna lewandowska she was the one who according to onets findings had corresponded with the suspected scientist zbigniew d and had met him at the national stadium on the occasion of a national team match discussed collecting a briefcase with contents not mentioned in the correspondence lewandowska immediately referred us to her manager who referred us to monika bondarowicz who was then in charge of the lewandowski familys pr when asked about lewys education in 2021 bondarowicz answered evasively\\n\\nthe diploma affair which we revealed went quiet for a while only the prosecutors office tried hard to establish who onets source was it questioned many people including the author of the article in turn lawyers for zbigniew d and his family began preparing a lawsuit against our editorial office\\n\\nthe topic returned in february 2024 at that time the central anticorruption bureau detained zbigniew d a scientist from d the same one who allegedly arranged the diploma for lewy zbigniew d was arrested in february in the notorious collegium humanum affair involving the issuing of fake mba diplomas according to investigators he was supposed to be an intermediary in this corrupt procedure the mastermind of which was supposed to be the rector of the university pawe c\\n\\nwhen we described zbigniew ds new troubles in february in onet and reminded readers that he had previously arranged suspicious diplomas for leading polish footballers representatives of robert lewandowski spoke out in the media\\n\\ndealing with the national team captains pr artur adamowicz announced that the footballer had those diplomas that were officially known  that is those from warsaw lewandowski was only supposed to learn about the appearance of his name in the context of the d university as his spokesman assured him from an onet publication in 2021\\n\\n has lewy bought a degree footballer again avoids the answer\\n\\nthis time we turned to lewandowskis representatives after dr barbara mroziskas post among other things we asked the following questions\\n\\n did lewandowski really buy a diploma at a d university as the sociologist publicly indicated\\n why was lewy visiting a d university linked to a suspicious scientist the proof is in his photo which we have seen\\n how does the footballer explain the fact that he has marks from exams he did not appear for\\n why was the athletes wife in correspondence with the suspected academic zbigniew d and several years ago arranged to meet him and collect his portfolio\\n does robert lewandowski have diplomas from d and if so why has he never boasted about them\\n\\nthe lewys pr officer artur adamowicz replied to us that following our questions lewandowskis representatives confirmed that he has witness status in the case and wants to answer the prosecutions questions first although the date of the hearing is not yet known he also provided a brief comment from kamil gorzelnik lewandowskis lawyer\\n\\nin response to the questions raised i would like to inform you that in the case concerning the university of social sciences in d robert lewandowski has the status of a witness and will answer all questions from the relevant authorities at an agreed date robert lewandowski has nothing to hide in this case and is keen to have it fully cleared up as part of the ongoing proceedings  this is the official position of the footballers lawyer\\n\\nthis position is surprising as lewandowski can hardly be said to be a witness in the case onets information shows that he has not been summoned for questioning to date\\n\\nso why are lewandowskis representatives claiming that he is a witness and that he would be waiting for a date to be set for the hearing is this another ploy to avoid answering our questions lewandowskis representatives have chosen to remain silent  they have not explained on what basis they claim and how they have confirmed that the footballer has witness status in the ongoing investigation\\n\\na spokeswoman for the gdask prosecutors office grayna wawryniuk in turn told onet that lewandowski has not been questioned so far and will he be eg as a witness the spokeswoman for the public prosecutors office replied that she was not aware of the footballer being summoned for questioning moreover the public prosecutors office due to the good of the investigation is not in the habit of announcing in advance whether it will question someone or not\\n\\n university from d lewy studied with us but didnt want to brag about it\\n\\nfor the time being the university of social sciences in d has presented its position on lewandowskis diplomas it had already taken onet and the author of this text to court many months ago the university associated with the scientist suspected of diploma trafficking argues that lewy first did his bachelors degree at the wsezins university in d where zbigniew d was chancellor then on 24 march 2018 he defended his masters thesis at the university of social sciences whose rector was the scientists wife\\n\\nhe was due to defend his masters thesis during the national teams training camp before the world cup in russia one day after losing a friendly match against nigeria and three days before winning a match against south korea the footballer according to the university defended himself via video conference and afterwards asked not to make publicity that he had just become a master teacher\\n\\nmoreover the university points out that lewandowskis d diploma has been recorded in the polon database which is among other things a record of certificates obtained by polish students in addition the footballers diploma has its own number and in his personal file are lewys bachelors and masters theses checked by the way in an antiplagiarism programme\\n\\nas witnesses to confirm this version the d university wants to call the suspected scientist zbigniew d his wife urszula who is also facing charges and anna and robert lewandowski as well as their close friend the doctor emil jdrzejewski the medic as he himself had previously argued in an interview with onet was said to have supplied the d university with documents relating to lewandowskis education and assured us that lewy had certainly studied there\\n\\nat the same time the university wants the trial against our editorial to take place behind closed doors without the participation of other media in secrecy from the public it explains this by its concern for the secrets of the company  the university  and by the fact that coverage of the trial could jeopardise unss

traveled all over the socialist bloc in the old days and north korea is the last one standing i was raised as an army brat and saw the cold war from the other side i have a degree in east asian politics and this was only natural to want to go after traveling china in the old days i also have a disdain for experts of any kind that have never set foot in the society they are studying this was very common during the cold war and with north korea\\n\\n2 how can you go if you are an american \\neasy just get on a tour there is a preconception that americans cannot go that is just not true on my first trip people online accused me of stealing photos now i routinely find my photos stolen by others \\n\\n3 what do you see as a tourist \\nthat depends on your first visit you will see very little relative to what you expect to see you will see some interesting things but unless you know what to look for you will not see that much you will be well fed and meet lots of nice people if you have not been to a totalitarian state what would you know to look for if you go back or stay long enough you will begin to see behind the society and get a better picture of things \\n\\n4 what are you allowed to photograph \\none of the reasons i go is to document the society i have taken 20000 photos the photo restrictions are the toughest i have encountered i used to tour eastern europe on my own as well as the ussr but this is something different in cuba they do not care what you shoot here you will have minders and it can be difficult i want to take photos of the korean people and their lives that is not always possible they will not shoot you but they will threaten or get others in the group to talk to you \\n\\n5 why do you go back\\nagain i want to see this society and the longer i can stay the more i see this year we got to see things not seen before an air raid the speaker more construction  the poorest areas of the country and more things tourists do not get to see remember

packages on korean sites was a challenge buying directly from the camellia line ferry wasnt an option either as all the secondclass the cheapest shared rooms tickets were sold out eventually i purchased my tickets from 12goasiahttps12goasiaen but it took days for them to confirm which was incredibly stressful i kept messaging and emailing them until they finally confirmed\\n\\narriving at busan port\\n\\nat busan stations you can follow the signs to the port if you arrive early and want to explore busan without your luggage theres a place to store it at the port just be aware that it closes around 12 pm for about an hour for a lunch break  \\nthe ticket advised arriving 3 hours before departure but we arrived about 15 hours before boarding checkin was pretty fast almost like an airport one important thing to remember bring your passport and if you have an arc good to have that too after checking in theres a small coffee shop and a dutyfree shop but dont expect wellknown brandsit seemed like mostly inhouse brands\\n\\nboarding the ferry\\n\\nwhen boarding started people rushed to get to their roomsprobably to secure spots in the lounge areas i was in second class which means sleeping on the floor in a japanesestyle setup there was one outlet in my room and the tv outlets it uses outlets for japan so i suggest buying an adapterconverter at daiso i am from canada so my chargers and hair straighter worked fine the pillows they provide are brickshaped and quite hard so if you need a proper pillow i highly suggest bringing your own if you are in second class the room i was in had about 10 people and while the rooms are generally gendersegregated i did see some rooms accommodating couples or families\\n\\nthe ferry has a cafeteria some vending machines and an openstyle bathroom with a small bath many passengers brought their own food like pizza and chicken and ate in the cafeteria the showers and the small convenience store onboard close once the ferry starts moving around 11 pm and the cafeteria might close too also note that only japanese yen is accepted on the ferry and during my trip the card machines werent working due to bad weather definitely bring cash another thing to note there is no wifi on board so i had my shows downloaded\\n\\nthe ride to fukuoka was honestly the worst ferry ride ive ever been on the boat was rocking so much that it was difficult to walk and i felt dizzy most of the timei held onto the wall for support my stomach felt like it was on a roller coaster on the way back though it was a completely different story the ride was so smooth i couldnt even feel the boat moving i strongly suggest bringing motion sickness medicine just in case both trips my friend slept through the whole entry thing and said it was super comfortable\\n\\nin the morning the showers open for a limited time so if you want to use them its a good idea to line up early you can also buy korean or japanese style breakfast also the ferry doesnt provide free toothbrushes or other toiletries so make sure to bring your own\\n\\none of the highlights of the trip was making a new friend on the ferry we shared some chicken and chatted before heading to our rooms to sleep the ferry also has a small arcade and karaoke rooms which added to the fun\\n\\nimmigration at fukuoka was surprisingly fast because i lined up with my luggage to get off the ferry first i put my luggage on the second floor in front of the exit door which many other passengers did as well however returning to korea took much longer as korean immigration seemed to be more thorough\\n\\nonce you arrive in fukuoka you can buy a bus card at the port and even an esim from a vending machine if youre an iphone user you can also buy a bus card through an app for those with phones that support esim i recommend purchasing one from an app like airalo theres a bus right at the port that takes you straight to hakata station for around 250 yen\\n\\ni hope my experience was able to help anyone who was thinking of taking a ferry from busan to japan\\n\\nedit  i wanted to add that i added camilla line ferry one line just to confirm if i was indeed a passenger because i was so nervous 12goasia was a scam which they did confirm and everything worked out the great part of adding them on line was that they were giving me updates on

but if you ever exit at any stop to see one of the sights along the way youll need to pay again\\n 2 way  both ways but once again you are not able to get on and off freely at the various stations\\n free use  as it implies you can get on and off all the stops however if you get on at a certain station you can not get on a 2nd time at the same station i guess they do this to prevent people from sharing their tickets\\n\\nhttpspreviewredditqckcyn3etbda1jpgwidth580formatpjpgautowebps7d1f51c9334355f150626e751c715623ff85667f\\n\\n2 the sky capsule will take you from the 1st stop mipo to the 3rd stop cheongsapo which is roughly halfway so if you want to check out all the other stops which you should then youll also need to either buy the train tickets from here or walk the rest of the wayi dont recommend walking back and forth sky capsule tickets can be difficult to get especially at the golden hours if you plan to take this route then id highly recommend booking your reservation well in advance else youll either not get to ride the sky capsule or youll have to wait a long time\\n\\n there are options for one way and two way but really once youve seen it one way you dont need to take the ride back\\n the best time imo to ride this is around sunset try to make a reservation around this time and youll thank me later\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nhttpspreviewreddit6j060i5qtbda1jpgwidth1061formatpjpgautowebps438a828138b8dbff01bd60f4810c730dc00f6217\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nx200b\\n\\n 3 you can also take the combo package and save a few \\n\\nx200b\\n\\n now for the stations  what really is there to see \\n\\n1 mipo is the 1st station and is located right beside haeundae beach if youre having a difficult time finding it know that its right behind the lct buildings at the east end of the beach you literally cant miss those buildings because theyre the tallest buildings in the entire area\\n2 dalmaji  walking trails and the best scenic routes along the entire path if youre leaving from mipo no need to get off here but on the way back then 100 get off here and walk back to mipo its a short walk and the walking trails here were my favorite part of the tourif you want to take some nice pictures  videos walk from dalmaji to mipo at sunset\\n3 cheongsapo  youll find a red lighthouse close to the ocean nice views but this area actually has good restaurants mostly seafood if you wander around youll find 1 street thats lined with restaurants one popular one has a bunch of tents outside where you can grill various types clams  drink soju\\n4 daritdol  this stop has the skywalk probably the most popular place to stop at inbetween the 1st and last stop good place to take photos\\n5 gudeokpo  theres a few cafes around here but there really isnt much to see here so i always skip this area\\n6 songjeong  this is the 3rd most popular beach in busan if youre looking for restaurants to dine at then this stop is probably your best bet most of the restaurants are further behind the beach rather than lining the beach so youll have to do a little research first on where they are but there are some really good places to eat at around here if you like thai food check out this place   a bam boo the restaurants infront of the beach are soso good for snacks not so much for proper meals but if you want a good quick snack then moon toast cafe right infront of the beach is one of my favorites\\n\\n but wait theres more  combine this with \\n\\nif youre new to busan and doing this as a part of your day trip then heres my biggest tip when youre at songjeong beach take a cab from here to haedong yonggungsa its one of koreas most beautiful temples the cab ride from here will only be 45 or so the temple is free to go to and if youre looking to feel koreas rich culture and history then this is probably one of the best places to go to in all of busan after checking out the temple you can walk or take a cab over to one of the largest outlet malls thats just down the street or take a cab back to seongjeong beach and from there hop back on the train back towards mipo station 1st stop\\n\\nhttpspreviewreddit39egnvoltbda1jpgwidth960formatpjpgautowebpsf4856996a6e2b0c598cd67ae17416d227bb0d2fa\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nas a foreigner who lives here in busan the names of each station can get

multiple times this was the perfect size for 5 adults and our luggage i was debating between the van vs a large suv and i feel i made the right choice my brother in law would have had to crawl over

people are scared of the stigma\\n\\nwhat is it like driving in korea jeju only speed camerasspeed cameras everywhere navigation will sound alarms until you pass and traffic adhere to these cameras so i think they are legit you also cant use google maps for real time navigation due to national security and will need to use the local apps including naver or kakao both of these apps are inferior imho

transportation \\npublic transportation is great here\\ni used public transportation in busan and seoul didnt really have an issue except on one day where they closed some parts of the city for a marathon \\ntheres usually a bus every 10 minutes\\ndont forget to tap in and out of the bus\\n\\nuber and kakao t\\ni used the uber app way more than kakao t\\nyou can select pay in person if you want to pay in cash or using a prepaid debit card\\nif using cash i gave the exact amount so i am unsure if they offer change \\nthe cost of using uberkakao isnt too bad but if theresa traffic the price does go up\\n\\n\\nif you are traveling with multiple large luggages please make your life easier and call use a taxi\\nat the airport you would usually have to cross the street to get a jumbo taxi  4050 usd \\nhotels will also help call a taxi for you on the way back to the airport just let them know in advance\\n\\n2 payment methods\\ni used cash credit cards and wowpass\\ni loved all three and if i were to come back i would still use all three payment methods\\n\\ncash transportation tmoney reload and uber street food and light shopping\\n\\ncredit cards transportation uber

transportation public and uber restaurants and shopping \\npros \\nthe currency exchange rate with wowpass is actually great better than most banks \\nonly had to use one card for shopping and transportation \\ncan check balance of the card and tmoney on the app\\ncons\\nnot enough machines in the city \\n\\n\\n3 esim or pocket wifi \\ni reserved the airport package with wowpass and received an esim\\nthe data is great didnt have any issues with it\\nthere is wifi almost everywhere you go \\n\\ni chose esim over pocket wifi because i didnt want to carry another item in my bag and

she used to talk poorly about her exes describing them as loser boyfriends who were too desperate her first boyfriend lasted about 2 years she said she kinda used him proudly saying how stupid he wasand then who ran and ghosted her after being together for 6 months now i really understand why he left her because he was not an idiot she has never lived abroad only traveled but she is oddly obsessed with european guysonly specific nationality talking poorly about exes is a red flag but at that time i was lonely and had just moved to busan she always drove me around she has a carand showed nice place and korean culture  so i ignored these red flags\\n\\n\\nthen she started to mentally and physically abuse me demanding a lot whenever i went out with coworkers she asked me to answer her texts within 20 minutes or she went crazy and called me 20times until i responded even though i never cheated and showed her my phone she is the one who cheated randomly sending messages to other foreigners and got caught however when she hung out with friends she never picked up the phone and would tell me   dont bother me and she always called me  fat pig theres no respect\\n\\nshe lives in a poor area in busan and insists she has no money but she always does her hair has surgery and owns saint laurent and gucci bags claiming that this is the korean girl way she manipulated me and made me think it was korean culture but my korean coworkers say shes crazy\\n\\nto be honest shes notpretty even with a lot of korean plastic surgery just an averagelooking girl and does so much photoshop on her ig photos and her kakao is a completely different person than the photo that i took and she always got super mad because im such a bad photographer and despite her not that good appearancefar from korean beauty standard looks dont really justify being judgmental but just pointed out her situation  she always commented on other men or girls who are in the street or restaurant all these things happened and there are more but i will just not say this time and i decided to move on from her lastly i dont know why i kept this relationship\\n\\ncrazy things happened last night im going to visit my family for christmas for 2 weeks and she wants to follow i have no intention of bringing this crazy woman to my family or thinking about our relationship going long term and definitely im not gonna marry her i want to stay with someone who is considerate and can have a mature relationship not her being 28 years old we cant even talk about stuff other than korean culture and her english is limited i said to her directly about my feelings and she went crazy comparing her ex apparently they brought her to their family and provided all expenses for a whole europe tour which is hard to believe but thats what she said and she wants to break up with me i said okay immediately and blocked her on kakao but she went crazy calling me 30 times in a row and now she is waiting in front of my apartment i really want to get rid of this toxic crazy woman in my life but dont know what to do is anyone who has a similar experience please tell me or can i actually report to the police this is crazy\\n\\nedit i get too many comments to reply all but thank you guys\\n\\nthose who live in busan please avoid this woman at all costs she is only fixated on a european guy who can supposedly save her lifejobless she quit the job after we are together ive noticed her consistently following and texting foreigner guys on instagram i was naive but after almost seven months

go back home tomorrow after work thank you so much for your concern i really appreciate it i feel bad for those who have experienced this nonsense we all deserve better one more thing yes i admit i was an idiot this time it may sound like an excuse if i were in norway  i will never dare to date someone who is mentally unstable and sicklike her ii had serious relationships with girls from my

improved preview feature for custom color settings with different preview backgrounds\\n\\n stranded spawn system\\n\\nregrouping with your team after getting stranded in a spawn room has never been easier spawn rooms that shut down due to capturing or losing an objective will now remain partially active for 7 seconds while you still cant change heroes in these spawn rooms other new features have been activated in these stranded spawns the doors remain locked to the opposing team the healing field remains active and you can now use the interact key to instantly teleport to the new active spawn room\\n\\n matchmaking\\n\\nbackfilling players in unranked modes will now prioritize finding players closer to the skill level of the other players in the match minor optimizations for large groups improving matchmaking quality\\n\\n competitive updates\\n\\n top 500 leaderboard eligibility\\n\\nplayers will now be required to win 25 competitive matches before being eligible to enter the top 500 leaderboard for a specific role queue or region\\n\\ndeveloper comments previously we only required 25 games to be completed regardless of winning prior to becoming eligible for the top 500 leaderboards however this change should help make sure that players are consistently pushing toward winning matches which should help ensure the leaderboards have the best players in each region\\n\\n competitive leaver penalty changes\\n\\nmatches left in different competitive queues are still considered separate for purposes of determining the lengths of suspensions or receiving a seasonal ban from competitive play\\n\\nthe start of a new competitive season also no longer fully resets the severity of these suspensions and bans this should hopefully prevent players from leaving competitive games at the end of a season without facing meaningful consequences at the start of the next\\n\\nmatches left in competitive play will also have a more negative effect on a players skill tier and division after a 5win competitive update\\n\\n competitive point reward changes\\n\\nthe number of competitive points cp rewarded for a win in competitive play has been changed from 15 to 25\\n\\nthe number of competitive points earned from seasonal challenges based on your final seasonal rank has also been updated games played after your last competitive update during a season will still count towards your final seasonal rank you must still compete in the seasons competitive play qualification challenge to receive bonus competitive points\\n\\n ending in bronze will now earn 300 competitive points previously 65\\n ending in silver will now earn 450 competitive points previously 125\\n ending in gold will now earn 600 competitive points previously 250\\n ending in platinum will now earn 800 competitive points previously 500\\n ending in diamond will now earn 1000 competitive points previously 750\\n ending in masters will now earn 1200 competitive points previously 1250\\n ending in grand masters will now earn 1500 competitive points previously 1750\\n\\n competitive challenge titles\\n\\nseasonal competitive titles earned from challenges now distinguish between whether they are earned in open queue or role queue for example\\n\\n ending in diamond rank in open queue will earn the diamond open challenger title\\n ending in diamond rank in role queue will earn the diamond role challenger title\\n\\ndeveloper comments the goal of these changes is to prevent confusion about a players rank from the previous season if they participate in multiple competitive queues\\n\\n competitive match rank\\n\\nthe initial loading screen that shows all the participants of competitive matches will now show an icon at the top of the screen representing the average skill tier and division of all players in that match this should provide players with a better comparison of their own rank to other players in the match\\n\\n seasonal rank decay removed\\n\\nstarting with season four a players competitive play rank will no longer be reduced at the beginning of a season furthermore the effects of this reduction of rank from previous seasons will also be removed depending on how many games they played during the previous season most players will see their skill tier and division increase a players skill tier and division at the beginning of season 4 will now closely match the matchmakers estimate of your current skill\\n\\ndeveloper comments the previous seasonal rank decay was causing considerable confusion for players who would see players in their competitive games who did not appear to be of a similar rank often these players were actually of similar skill but they had not played enough games during the season to compensate for the initial decay\\n\\n competitive skill update and progression\\n\\nboth the competitive progress and competitive update screens will now include information about a players losses and ties as well as their wins\\n\\nthe competitive update screen will also now provide players with an indication of their current percentage progress within a skill division this will hopefully make it more clear how the results of games played during the update affect a players skill tier and division\\n\\nit is possible for players to have a positive winloss record but not go up a skill division because the progress occurs entirely within a single division this new message will allow players to see that they did in fact make positive progress just not enough to reach a new skill tier or division\\n\\nthere is also a similar message with competitive updates for players who are grandmaster 1 but not yet on the top 500 leaderboard this should provide those players with feedback about their progress towards earning a spot on the top 500 leaderboard\\n\\n hero updates\\n\\n tank\\n\\nreinhardt\\n\\n armor health reduced from 300 to 250\\n base health increased from 175 to 200\\n\\ndeveloper comment reinhardt has been overperforming after the recent increases to his offensive capabilities those changes have been playing well so to adjust his overall power were reducing his overall health through this armor reduction\\n\\nsigma\\n\\naccretion\\n\\n impact damage reduced from 60 to 40 80 damage total with explosion\\n knockdown duration increased from 08 to 11 seconds\\n\\ndeveloper comment like roadhogs chain hook sigmas accretion and primary fire combo can be highly lethal and can feel like a guaranteed kill against 200 health targets were reducing the damage slightly to require an additional volley of primary fire but are also increasing the stun duration to provide allies with more opportunity to follow up on successful impacts\\n\\n damage\\n\\ncassidy\\n\\n base health reduced from 225 to 200\\n\\nmagnetic grenade\\n\\n damage reduced from 131 to 120\\n\\ndeveloper comment magnetic grenade only requiring one additional primary fire shot after sticking to a target was too reliable to execute on even though it only works at close range were reducing the total damage on magnetic grenade evenly split between the direct target damage and explosion the reduced falloffdamage buff his primary fire received recently enables cassidy to play from safer engagement ranges now so were reducing his health back to 200\\n\\nsombra\\n\\n emp can now disable blizzard\\n\\ndeveloper comment we are expanding what sombras emp turns off to keep it consistent with how it affects other devicecontrolled ultimates\\n\\n support\\n\\nana\\n\\nsleep dart\\n\\n maximum duration on tank heroes reduced 30 from 5 to 35 seconds\\n\\ndeveloper comments weve been watching how effective sleep dart has been in 5v5 gameplay it hasnt been overly disruptive as a whole but since it is significantly more reliable to land against tank heroes due to their large hit boxes and even more valuable to do so with only one tank on the field were reducing its maximum duration against those targets\\n\\nbrigitte\\n\\nrally\\n\\n brigitte now gains 100 restorable armor health pool for the duration of rally\\n brigitte no longer gradually builds temporary health like her nearby allies\\n rally now upgrades her barrier shield increasing both its size and health\\n barrier health increased from 300 to 750 during the ultimate\\n during rally shield bash now impacts multiple enemies and briefly stuns them\\n bonus movement speed reduced from 30 to 15\\n\\nrepair pack\\n\\n range reduced from 30 to 25 meters\\n\\ndeveloper comments rally lost some of its power with the change from granting allies additional armor to temporary health and overall took a relatively long time to build up its defensive benefits this rework is intended to keep it as a defensive ultimate ability but with a more immediate impact due to gaining an increased armor health pool upfront and the enhanced barrier which can be utilized to block for teammates while their temporary health builds or interrupt enemies with the stun\\n\\nmercy\\n\\ncaduceus staff\\n\\n healingpersecond increased from 45 to 55\\n healing is no longer increased for allies under half health\\n\\nguardian angel\\n\\n cooldown reduced from 25 to 15 seconds\\n jump and crouch cancel active ability state duration increased from 10 to 15 seconds\\n the jump and crouch cancel active ability state can no longer be manually interrupted to begin the cooldown early\\n\\nvalkyrie\\n\\n support role passive healing is now active for the duration of valkyrie\\n\\ndeveloper comment the recent increase to guardian angels jumpcancel mobility still needs to be kept in check in some way but while the last iteration was simple it also had some unintended effects such as not being ready to use ga again after flying in and using resurrect this revision provides more flexibility and allows mercy to opt into an additional 15 second cooldown when using the increased mobility from the jumpcrouch cancel options or otherwise waiting for the base cooldown time\\n\\nthe increased healing multiplier condition on caduceus staff was intended to help mercy players feel more agency in trying to save criticalhealth allies and to add depth to the healing mechanic without changing the total time to heal to full health however the overall rebalance of the healing values received significant negative feedback both from those playing as mercy and those playing against it there wasnt a satisfying middle ground where we could reduce the potency of this effect while still having it feel impactful so were reverting it\\n\\nmoira\\n\\nfade\\n\\n can now be activated during coalescence\\n\\ncoalescence\\n\\n bonus movement speed reduced from 50 to 40\\n\\nbiotic grasp\\n\\n lingering heal duration increased from 2 to 3 seconds\\n\\ndeveloper comments being able to use fade during her coalescence ultimate gives moira more playmaking ability by being able to reposition even more quickly and avoid potential threats with quick reactions due to the more spreadout playstyle of 5v5 were increasing the lingering heal duration from her primary fire meaning it will heal more in total\\n\\n map updates\\n\\n general updates\\n\\nmap pools have been disabled all maps are now in rotation\\n\\n new arcade map talantis\\n\\nyou designed it we built it an underwater talon base with jump pads pit traps giant

koreanhttpswwwinvencokrwebzinenewsnews271910\\n\\nvideo link koreanhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcj453w2ai0\\n\\ninven has released an hourlength interview with faker where he talks deeply about his motivators the current state of esports and his view of the future ive taken the time to translate the text as below ive added some words in brackets to aid understanding\\n\\n inven interview with faker  what keeps the legend living\\n\\nby reporters arrah kibaek nam dohyun lee\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nafter confirming an interview with faker this reporter was more worried than excited my most pressing concern was how to fully make use of the precious 1 hour given to me and how to convey his thoughts with clarity even while covering the 2022 msi group stage in busan an interview with faker kept its presence known in the corner of my mind  however the interview went more smoothly than i expected there was a bit of nervousness mixed in at the start but as we started talking the conversation never dangled this may be the reporters speculation but faker also grew more comfortable as 5 minutes 10 minutes passed you look very happy when talking about money he even joked thus the interview was ended after a full hour  money was the strongest motivator for the faker of 2013 as he had chosen the road less traveled he thought that he needed to earn a wage to begin with after he earned as much as he needed the desire to overcome challenges a bit of mannerism and a sense of responsibility were the things that drove him on he desired to challenge himself to winning even more he wanted to keep on winning like he had and he felt he had to do his best since that was his role  the faker of 2022 now with countless trophies under his belt still desires for the next championship and works tirelessly what is the driving force behind this living legend\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nicebreaking 2022 msi\\n\\nlets begin our interview with good news youve finished the group stage without dropping a single game\\n\\nobviously my goal was to do that in my mind msi really starts from the rumble stage and i treated this phase as a time to adapt and played without much care there was a bit of a hassle adapting to the new ping but i think ive adapted sufficiently to it and my gameplay quality has shown that i have as well the ping was noticeably smoother on the last day but for the days before that it was around 50 ping now it feels like 35 its much smoother now\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nyoure said to be very sensitive to such ingame measures you must have felt very uncomfortable\\n\\nsince the mid laning phase itself and how to play out the game as a mid laner is affected quite heavily by a single skillshot i think there are many mid laners who are sensitive to ping changes im an outlier in that front obviously im not showing 100 of my full skill but ive had much experience adapting to a slower ping so its not that big of an obstacle\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nalthough it is in progress this msi has had many shortcomings so far\\n\\nthe 2022 msi is held in korea but with all the hiccups i personally felt a bit disappointed by the host company remaking games it can be very intolerable by teams i think the remake happened because riot failed to organize the tournament properly there were other problems as well as ping so i think those make this tournament not what i expected\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nthe 1st story v10 and 9 years of faker\\n\\nwhats the difference between your tenth lck championship and your first\\n\\nmy biggest motivator for my first championship was money to be a pro gamer its like youve turn from the path of finishing school and getting a normal job with all the security it offers so when i first started out i was hungry for a victory so i could earn money however after winning over the course of several years i earned as much as i needed and that motivator faded afterwards how many trophies could i lift up as a pro gamer that was my goal its like a personal challenge of mine but its also because ive kept winning obviously i tried harder since its my job and what ive been doing for a long time\\n\\nhowever my most recent driving force is selfimprovement i really want to improve myself as a gamer as a result on the surface im aiming for winning championships which is a must for a pro gamer but on the inside my first priority is working hard to improve my skill as a player more than winning\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nyouve been famous for practicing heavily as time went on your schedule must have become more packed has that impacted your practice time in any way\\n\\nfirstly my schedule has always been packed however its true that im definitely practicing less than i used to in 2013 i would play for 15 hours a day but now i only play 1012 the key to keeping up these hours even with a busy schedule is my desire to win i absolutely abhor losing if i fall behind i get angry and practice more\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nhow did you keep your desire to win constant over the course of 10 years\\n\\nmy personality plays a big part im the type to see the end of whatever im interested in im also someone who likes to dig in deep how to play betterim always thinking of stuff like that\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nwhat about your health its a mustfactor in longevity as a gamer\\n\\nphysically i have nothing that can take me away from gaming mentally i dont think im in good shape right now and i need to try harder in that aspect as a pro gamer i think of mental health as how hard i can concentrate on the game right now i think i have many shortcomings in concentrating and maintaining peak form so im working on those\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nyou seem to be the type to find things to improve on and work on them what do you think youve improved in the most\\n\\nin the past i was a bit more selffocused and uhi would look at the trees instead of the forest now ive improved heavily in that aspect ive changed the most in that im now trying to take in more ideas to grow in different ways\\n\\nthe biggest factor in how ive changed is reading books i came by a book in 2015 and read it a few times and i think theyve changed me into becoming a more open and receptive person and these individual changes were the driving force in how i would act this also helped a lot in extending my career as a pro gamer\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nyoure famous for reading as a hobby do you have any books you recommend\\n\\nright now im reading books about neuroscience and psychology but its a niche genre even in the past i would read stodgy titles which is an acquired taste so i dont think i can recommend any books fans have listed all the books ive read so instead of my recommendation you can look at them and pick one you think sounds fun every book ive read has helped me in some way and there were no books that werent fun\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nhave you experienced being comforted by books\\n\\ni had read several books about comforting and theyve helped me every time reading something in itself is a very comforting action i think this is supported by science sometimes i feel my stress levels drop when i read\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nif you read books to help your everyday mental health id like to expand that into a question of how you keep calm ingame\\n\\nfirst off i almost am never stressed out during pro play so i dont really need a method to keep calm i almost never get angry or excited when playing since im always focused on the game state itself when practicing i sometimes whine or get touchy whenever that happens i just hold it in or let time take care of it\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nnot having emotional fluctuations in game seems to be another ingredient for your longevity in fact the talk of the house seems to be the resurgence of veterans like yourself faker\\n\\ni think its to be expected ive never thought that the lifespan of pro gamers should be short its natural that some will retire and some will not its also a given that there will be veterans who are good and others who arent i never had any preconceptions about age if we move past their age its natural to have good players and bad players\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nthe scene seems to be much more receptive and nonprejudiced about age than before\\n\\nin the past it was difficult to know how to extend player longevity during the starcraft days players would retire in their mid20s however looking at the physical and mental requirements lol demands theyre different from what starcraft requires so i thought that players would be more longlived for example lol is much less wristintensive than starcraft is that might be a factor in why players can play for longer periods\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nbreak time faker most  moments\\n\\nfakers most spectacular moment\\n\\n2013 i had so much drive and there was so much stimulation and novel experiences i think spectacular is the perfect term to describe that year\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nfakers most explosive moment\\n\\ni think its 2013 im most satisfied with my play back then\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nfakers most happiest moment\\n\\nas a pro gamer it would be 2013\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nlee sanghyeoks most happiest moment\\n\\nit would still be 2013 when i first won a championship thats burned into my mind\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nfakers most hardworking moment\\n\\n2016 i was gaming in a daze and i suffered many slumps then\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nfakers most difficult moment\\n\\nlast year i had lost confidence in myself and there were many trying moments it was a turbulent year\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nthe moment i want to return to\\n\\nwhen i was in elementary school everyone might be like this but i was happy when i was young so i want to go back to being a child if possible with the memories i have now since if my brain is wiped ill repeat my life when i was young i would skip homework and play instead of studying if i go back i would study more and find a girlfriend ill do the everyday stuff the stuff you can only do when youre a child\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nthe 2nd story faker and t1\\n\\nits not an easy feat being a oneclub player what do you think kept you with t1 ever since your debut\\n\\nquality of life since i play in korea its more comfortable for me and korean food is the best from a pro gamers perspective i thought i would have the highest chance of winning when i stayed in korea there are other reasons than that but to keep it short those are my reasons\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nthis can be a sensitive question but there were rumors your recent resigning didnt go smoothly\\n\\ni also think my resigning this year was very rough every signing has been back in 201314 when i was clueless it was easy but since 2015 every single signing was difficult\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nfrom t1s ceo joe marsh its been known you refused a 20 million offer if its not the money what keeps faker going\\n\\nmoney is the most important but there are other things to consider i received several offers and resigned after considering various factors money is just another factor\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nfrom the skt days to the t1 of now the organization has grown as well there are more sponsors and now a new gaming hq you must have played a big role do you feel anything about this\\n\\ni always thought that t1 was already a matured esports gaming organization even when they were skt so i dont think ive played any role in that obviously my contribution as a star player of the org exists but that wasnt due to any desire of mine it happened naturally thats why i dont think i contributed anything  t1 and i are in a symbiotic relationship just like i work hard t1 treats me well as our contract stipulates so theres no waxing poetic about that\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nwill you stay with t1 forever\\n\\nsince anything can happen during resignings i cant give a concrete answer to that im focused on playing well as a t1 player\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nthe 3rd story faker and esports\\n\\nthe prestige of esports is soaring it may be noticeable to you as you appear on diverse multimedia platforms\\n\\ncompared to before pro gamers have become more attractive to the 3040 demographic and so ive received more calls to appear on tv and more premium treatment i was treated well when i first appeared on tv but it has only gotten better people are more polite and respectful\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nesports has been selected as an official event for the asian games\\n\\nits a natural case of supply following demand the esports market will continue to grow for 3040 years personally i expect the olympics to have an esports event in 10 years i think its very possible as long as there arent any organizational mistakes like this msi controversy\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nthe korean government is also taking notice the yoon administration has announced its plan to create home stadiums for esports\\n\\nhonestly i dont know well about home stadiums so i cant say much i dont watch a lot of baseball so im uninformed but i do think that esports doesnt really need home stadiums as others have said\\n\\nx200b\\n\\ngoing back to lol youve garnered interest for talking about the state of soloqueue during your live stream are you utilizing your hotline\\n\\nyes when i suspect a troll i report them however if theyre sneaky about it its hard to find its a complicated issue both for players and riot recently the number of blatant trolls has decreased but another problem is the quality of games  each soloqueue games quality overly fluctuates i think its related to targeted throwing but i dont think i can elaborate on that\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nyou werent the type to speak out on these issues but recently youve been more vocal and it has led to good outcomes is there a reason for this change\\n\\nits not something ive tried to make happen but i was so stressed out that i had an emotional outbreak thankfully the fans looked well on it and it ended okay but i will try to be more reasonable in the future i dont feel any pressure to speak out as the media refers to additionally it may be fine to publicly discuss these matters but the best course of action is to find a solution between the involved parties in whatever case\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nthe ending\\n\\npersonally i think theres a special difference between a layperson and an outlier in their field what is your special difference what is fakers greatest weapon\\n\\nin my case i think i was extremely lucky i dont think im any different from other people my personality has been very helpful in working as a pro gamer but its not like you can create your own personality i think the environment is 100 responsible for how your personality develops my environment getting into a good team and meeting good teammates that was how i could keep playing and keep winning\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nim not talking about retirement but im curious about the faker 10 years from now\\n\\nim not sure ive tried to envision it but i would draw a blank what i want for me 10 years from now is to be prosperous peaceful and happy maybe have a religion and cultivate my inner peace i think that would be the best for me and ill be happy that way i dont think where i am will be important\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nmy last question might be one youre familiar with but its still powerful what are your fans to faker\\n\\nmy fans are the giver of the greatest of joys i think theres no difference between my fans and myself the fans are my joy and i am their joy as well if i work hard for myself i believe my fans will be happy too in conclusion i think my fans are my driving force to work hard ill try harder to obtain a good result for this msi'}, {'title': 'trip report around the world in nine months', 'selftext': 'i just returned from my trip and figured i could write a review

stronger than ever and working from amazing offices\\n\\n1  last year i mentioned that my daytoday life is wildly varied and i liked that samesame really tough to get a routine going which has its pros and cons i think after living by the seat of my pants im excited for some monotony  this feels good though one extreme has made me appreciate the other\\n2  last year i said my relationship with mandi was stronger than ever only growth on this front now that were settling down shes getting into some hobbies and reconnecting with high school friends in bangkok and i love it\\n3  the last 2 years i mentioned that the potential places one can work while nomading are excellent this year id say that only pc bangs pc and my home office delivered  but kaikatsu club being my best option in japan was pretty frustrating internet in japan as a tourist was easily the worst logistical nightmare ive suffered in our journey more on that later\\n\\n gearapps we use\\n\\n a repeat entry over the years i swear im not sponsored italki is clutch japanese learning went very well by the end of the trip i was able to navigate restaurants bars clubs taxis and stores with ease i even made a friend in tokyo in my experience when speaking japanese to somebody they were very willing to stick with japanese regardless of how broken you sounded it really helped me improve quickly and im glad i did because there were many many times the ability to speak and understand helped i tried to learn korean in just a few weeks initially it was going well because its so similar to japanese however i gave up pretty quickly because i observed that seoul had the opposite phenomenon occurring when communicating with others even if their english was way worse than my korean theyd stay in english besides that a much larger percentage of people in seoul had great englishlanguage skills in my opinion enjoying japan in the cities i stayed in as a nomad would be difficult without learning some japanese but thats definitely not the case for seoul when we get back home mandi is going to take up thai and im going to review japanese in case we go for a ski trip this winter\\n in the same vein i almost never use google translate anymore because i think chatgpt is simply so much better especially for japanese korean vietnamese and thai\\n just like last year shout out to the tax professionals and accountants at both nomadtaxiohttpsnomadtaxio and zenaccountingcomhttpzenaccountingcom\\n\\n what has been the biggest challenge\\n\\n  language barriers i was pleasantly surprised that we had no issues at all in italy or croatia i was surprised that even in ohrid and rural crete weve been able to communicate easily with only english knowing a bit of spanish helped me in athens and zagreb surprisingly  and mandi can always find the good thai restaurants by just speaking to people all that said i still think its one of the bigger challenges in dning because when there is an issue it sucks being unable to organically engage with people and be attached to google translate\\n  vs  the airbnb vs hotel fight isnt an absolute this remains true japan is a good example both the available hotels and airbnbs were awful i dont know whats up with japan and korea airbnb attempting to shove a mattress into every open corner of a house but it was wildly difficult to find 1 monthlong stays in places that had just like a queen mattress per bedroom in a 1 or 2bedroom place we literally couldnt in tokyo we ended up using hmlet in tokyo and absolutely loved the experience it was a bit more expensive but  as the japan trip continued  we realized it was worth every penny more on why later in osaka kyoto seoul and busan there were still a wild amount of barracks masquerading as airbnbs but there were enough decent options that we booked hotels were easily more expensive in seoul if i were younger or working better hours id probably have tried to stay at the hoppin house hosted by digitalnomadskoreacomhttpdigitalnomadskoreacom as it wouldve been wildly fun and affordable\\n  balancing longstays daytrips andor smaller excursions i feel like we conquered this 2023 challenge in 2024 the pacing was much nicer however i do think were about to ruin it \\n  health issues while abroad mandi had a ruptured ovarian cyst while we were in seoul as if a womans body doesnt struggle with enough the doctor explained to us that women always get cysts on their ovaries whether or not they rupture is just a fun little lottery women are forced to participate in every time they ovulate the initial experience felt similar to what ive seen somebody else go through when their appendix burst where you think its a stomach pain and it just gets worse and worse until you realize you need to go to the hospital my american mind started looking up taxis to take us to the hospital but then i paused and googled tourist ambulance seoul and found out theyre free for everybody in all of korea america could never it took about 4 days for her to recover something good came out of the experience too as we had been planning an emergency trip to the us for mandi to pick up more meds as i mentioned earlier her health provider simply stopped offering telehealth and would not help us with switching to a different provider but the hospital refilled all of her prescription medications in the end the total cost was about 45m about 3200 at the time without insurance i was dreading the bill but it was not as bad as i thought it was going to be\\n  awful working hours while in east asia i arranged to do 24 shared us hours for my major client per night even that did little to help the horrible sleeping situation doing 8pm to 4am is not sustainable longterm in fact just that 5ish month stint has caused me some health issues once we got settled in bangkok i went to the hospital because i have been extremely phlegmy for months i was diagnosed with sleep apneainduced gerd now even though i have more hours to sleep with the gerd is making it a cyclical problem by making it hard for me to sleep take care of your body folks im hoping that returning to us time zone and sleeping more normal people hours will help\\n\\n what surprised us and what we wish we knew before\\n\\n  nontourist sim with voice neigh impossible to attain in japan we thought india was difficult wew this simhttpswwwmobalcomjapansimcardtst from mobalcomhttpmobalcom is the only one weve seen that offers voice to tourists however we only found out about it while we were in japan if youre staying for a long time this is a mustbuy imo because so much of japan still runs on phone calls and emails more than half of our restaurant reservations we had to do in person or via a friend who could call the data is obviously low but you can pair this with a pocket wifi and be set for phone usage imo\\n  gigabit internet an epic journey to access as a tourist in japan getting highquality internet for work was extremely difficult in our experience the property we booked with hmlet was brand new and hadnt yet setup the internet infrastructure so we had to go with a trio mobile hotspots they provided for a few weeks theyd typically get 1020mbps if they stayed connected  we thought maybe they just gave us bad ones so we tried httpsrentalcdjapancojphttpsrentalcdjapancojp httpswwwjapanwirelesscomhttpswwwjapanwirelesscom and httpsninjawificomhttpsninjawificom all of them essentially behaved the same we eventually found a legitimately 5g 100300mbps download speed and good connection hotspot that was more expensive 200 a month  and it still had 15gb3 day limits with httpsglobaladvancedcommcomhttpsglobaladvancedcommcom multiple groups of friends and family visited us while in japan and they frequently got their own hotels and we asked them to assess their internet situations everybody encountered the same thing hotels provided wifi that would barely scrape 1020mbps all of this is totally fine for tourism but impossible for working collaboratively as a frontend web developer it also sucked that my only major recourse was to go to kaikatsu club at around 2hr for unlimited 2gbps internet its cute and fun but it was heinously nonergonomic because every room was either a tatami mat or a mat with a weird cushioned lawn chair when the internet was finally activated in our hmlet we measured the gigabit stable connection and it was like drinking water in a desert we hadnt booked our stays in kyoto or osaka until january and because of our experience we pressed hard in hosts dms trying to ascertain if the internet they would provide was going to be a legitimate hardwired routerprovided connection or if it would be hotspots in kyoto we got what we wanted however in osaka we kinda got duped i messaged about 15 hosts in the city and only one responded that they would have installed internet by the time of my stay when we arrived one pocket wifi with a 3gbday cap  when i pointed out the issue the host apologized profusely and paid for another one of the good pocket wifis but yeah its fuckin tough to get decent internet with longterm stays in japan also we were there december to february which is firmly low season i cant imagine how tough it is in the spring\\n  korean digital infrastructure is difficult to navigate on a tourist visa while japan is tough to enjoy because everything is still phone calls and emails korea is tough because everything is an app thats only used in korea frequently has no translations and often requires an arc number which you dont get as a tourist whatsapp no kakaotalk googleapple maps no navermaps also for food reviews and kakaomap a lot of these work without an arc number but you absolutely need a sim with a korean phone number to use almost all of these apps the first day we were there we went to five guys and was literally not allowed to enter the line because i had not yet gotten a phone number if you qualify and are staying for a month or more id definitely do the new nomad visahttpsdigitalnomadskoreacomposteverythingyouneedtoknowaboutkoreasdigitalnomadvisa so you can get an arc number it wasnt an option when we had planned our trip but our life was made easier thanks to a stateside friend who used to live in korea telling her friends to hang out with us hoppin house and the group that runs digital nomads korea also helped make things easier and more enjoyable by organizing events and giving us an avenue to use coupang\\n  ramen is built different in japan i ive heard the hype on the sushi and the food in general in japan and it all did taste amazing however the bit that surprised me the most was the ramen we had loads of ramen at nonfranchised places and noninternational chains but just to highlight the point ive eaten ramen at nonjapan locations for ippudo ichiran and jinya and all of their equivalents in japan blow them out of the water the flavor difference to me felt almost akin to a different dish\\n\\n  korean bbq is life not much else to say here after leaving seoul i found myself wishing i had eaten at a noname red chair picnic table type bbq place after 6pm on a friday just once though as a passerby the vibes seemed immaculate\\n\\n  nomad groups seem always worth a try we had such a lovely time hanging out with the folks at hoppin house who run the whatsapp group for digitalnomadskoreacomhttpdigitalnomadskoreacom the whatsapp group in turkey was also helpful for meeting people from both groups weve made some lifelong friends i kinda wish we had reached out in more places to hang out with more people but thats cuz im outgoing ymmv\\n'}, {'title': 'train to busan was much more emotional than i thought it would be especially for a zombie

which has been hard hit by the outbreak to put off travel to japan and will cancel visas for travelers from the two countries abe said\\n\\nin order to reduce the amount of inbound travel from china

returning from vacation in those areas entry visas are being cancelled for china korea hong kong macau and iran which sounds like it means you will be quarantined at the border and could be sent home after the 14 days are up\\n\\nif you have a flight with a stopover in either country you would be wise to contact your airline right away and arrange to either fly direct or reroute through a

outbreakhttpswwwjapantimescojpnews20200310nationalpoliticsdiplomacycabinetbillshinzoabestateofemergencycoronavirusxmez6qhkiul this is not a state of emergency please read the link above or our summary below\\n\\nthe cabinet on tuesday approved a bill that would enable prime minister shinzo abe to declare a state of emergency if needed as japan scrambles to stop the spread of the new coronavirus abe who faced criticism for being too relaxed in his initial response to the outbreak has sought the power to prepare for a worst case scenario\\n\\nmoreover the prime minister has extended a government request to event organizers nationwide to refrain from holding such gatherings by about 10 days the request was initially until march 19\\n\\nthe legal change would allow the prime minister to declare a state of emergency lasting up to two years if coronavirus infections spread rapidly across the country and fears are raised of a grave impact on peoples lives and the economy\\n\\nonce an emergency is declared prefectural governors can instruct residents to stay indoors and ask for schools to close and events to be canceled\\n\\nlocal governments can also demand that essential supplies such as medicine and food be sold to them they can temporarily take over private land and facilities to provide medical care\\n\\nabe has already requested that schools across the nation close and big sports and cultural events be canceled or postponed but under the current law the government does not have the legal power to enforce school closures or event cancellations\\n\\nthe main opposition constitutional democratic party of japan and the democratic party for the people say the prime minister should seek prior parliamentary approval before any declaration of a state of emergency\\n\\nonce again this bill does not enact a state of emergency for the country it merely means to reflect and strengthen the laws put in place from previous viral outbreaks in japan\\n\\nalso of note is the recommendation by a panel of experts to continue closures for another 10 days beyond what has already been notedhttpsenglishkyodonewsnetnews20200329c7cf7a3604urgentabeextendsrequestforeventcancellationsamidvirusspreadhtml in the comments we will be updating the closures thread as necessary as companies

timehttpswww3nhkorjpnhkworldennews2020030901  \\n\\nwe have reprinted the article in full below  \\n\\njapan increased border control measures on monday in an effort to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus\\n\\nthe government is asking people arriving from china and south korea including japanese nationals to stay at home or other private accommodation for two weeks at their own expense\\n\\nofficials are asking those travelers to refrain from using public transportation including planes trains buses and taxis and use private or rental cars from the airport of their entry to their homes or accommodation facilities\\n\\nvisitors are asked to declare to quarantine officials where they will stay during the first two weeks as well as their means of transportation from the airport they will be asked to remain at the airport until arrangements are ready\\n\\nduring the twoweek period they will be asked to check their health daily if they develop a fever and other symptoms they are asked to call a consultation center and visit a designated hospital\\n\\nthe measures are expected to remain in effect until the end of this month they are not legallybinding but the health ministry is asking for cooperation\\n\\nonce again we would advise if you have a stopover in any of the affected countries china korea hong kong macau  named specifically that you contact your airline to change your flight as soon as possible these measures will be in force until the end of this month at the very least\\n\\ntourism update 0306\\n\\njapanese prime minister shinzo abe we will ask people entering japan from the two countries to stay at places designated by the quarantine chief for two weeks and not to use public transportation systems in the countryhttpswww3nhkorjpnhkworldennews2020030602\\n\\na more in depth explanation of the restrictions is explained herehttpswwwjapantimescojpnews20200305nationaljapanquarantinearrivalschinasouthkoreaxmhjsyhkiuk \\n\\nthis appears to be seperate from a bigger bill aimed at reducing the number of overall tourists at this moment to halt the spread of the virus the nhk has posted an article on the other measures of the billhttpswww3nhkorjpnhkworldennews2020030550 and how it will allow the government to enact a state of emergency  giving them the power to control some businesses operating hours close schools and instruct people to stay indoors authorities would also be able to use buildings and land without their owners consent for medical purposes  \\n\\nin short if you are a korean or chinese national you will not be allowed to enter the country without facing a 14 day quarantine any planes arriving from either location will only be processed at either narita or kansai airport starting march 9th and lasting until march 31st it will also include visitors from hong kong and macau as well as japanese nationals coming from these countries  we are assuming this includes those returning from vacation in those areas entry visas are being cancelled for china korea hong kong macau and iran which sounds like it means you will be quarantined at the border and could be sent home after the 14 days are up\\n\\nif you have a flight with a stopover in either country you would be wise to contact your airline right away and arrange to either fly direct or reroute through a different area to avoid getting caught up in the quarantine we have no confirmation that stopovers are excluded or included in this requirement but its better to be safe than sorry\\n\\ntourism update 0228  \\n\\nthe japanese government has rolled out requirements to help curb the spread of the virus as the next

my travels should i worry\\n\\nits been an unfortunate side effect of the coronavirus that many people including travellers of asian background or ethnicity have reported a spike in racist or

'selftext': 'hi in light of the recent vtl i figured there might be many considering trips to korea but might be hesitant because theyre not sure about how the situation is in seoul rn or how the tourist scene has evolved\\n\\ni moved to korea last year at the very beginning of the pandemic when the first few cases hit daegu i havent been back to sg since lol got vaxxed here too but anyway i hope to give some insight to those who are on the fence\\n\\n1 how are social distancing guidelines in korea right now\\n\\nseoul and the greater metropolitan area gyeonggi province is level 4 other cities busan jeonju jeju are level 3 assuming everyone in your group is fully vaccinated you can have up to 8 people or 10 for level 3 as of oct 15 level 4 also means that all establishments have to close at 10pm but restaurants can continue to do takeawaydelivery mask mandate continues\\n\\n2 are the tourist spots still open\\n\\nmyeongdong has been very badly hit dont bother the shopping streets in ewha and dongdaemun areas that had tourists as their main customer base are pretty quiet but life in other areas is basically quite normal and business is as per usual id say dont worry too much about that  just look for spots that locals go to as for attractions theme parks etc still open just running at less capacity i saw pictures of everland being super full last week \\n\\n3 i wanna travel to jejua different city instead of seoul how do i make that happen with vtl\\n\\nyou have to isolate for a day until your negative test results come back technically if you can make private transport arrangements you can go to whatever city you want after you land and isolate there but of course its going to be challenging going straight to busan or jeju practically impossible with private transport from incheon airport so you should stay a day in seoulsomewhere nearer to incheon first until the next morning then youre free to go\\n\\n4 how does contact tracing happen if i visit a cluster\\n\\nif its a big cluster there will be a public health alert  disaster message thing sent to all phones in the administrative area of that particular establishment to advise you to get tested free and if you visited at the same time you should also be contacted by the local health center to get a mandatory test free theyll get your contact number because before you enter any restaurants  shopping mall etc youll have to sign in like how sg does tt i suppose for locals we use kakaotalk or naver to generate a qr code tied to our local identity but i believe shortterm visitors wont be able to do this because you dont have a resident number so every place will usually have a book for you to manually sign in  if you cant provide a prepaid number i think you can give your kakao id cause ive seen some exchange students do that also discussions are ongoing on how to get tt qr codes to be verified with the korean system i believe vice versa for koreans visiting sg or people like me returning home \\n\\n5 what happens if i catch covid here touchwood\\n\\nyoull be send to a living facility until your symptoms subside the cost should be borne by you but thats what insurance is for so please get the appropriate policy\\n\\n6 why are you in korea and how long have you been there will you stay here long term \\n\\ngoing into my 3rd year soon im doing uni here and i chose to study here because my department is not offered in singapore if i say what it is i might self dox so if you really wanna know pm but its something very specific to korea my plan after grad is to either continue with my masters here or work for 3 years or so then balik kampong \\n\\n7 is life stressful here \\n\\nyes\\n\\n8 is everyone a kpop star or a walking plastic surgery advertisement do you see gong yoo at the train station\\n\\nno\\n\\n9 can you speak fluent korean or is it easy to get by without learning the language here\\nmy topik score is a low level 6 so i would say yes fluent to a certain extent and i take a good portion of uni classes in korean but you can definitely surive without knowing much korean here if in a big city and actually even in the countryside can also la just use papago naver translate\\n\\n\\n\\nok thats about all i can think of for now i would say if you dont mind forking out the test fees and you want a more relaxing holiday go for it obviously things arent completely the same as precovid no more overnight shopping midnight karaoke or midnight street food  at least for level 4 but this is the new normal after all and you can still have fun\\n\\nedit formatting also added some reoccurring questions to the post for those who are considering a move and want some indepth answers on life here especially potential uni students please feel free to ask or dm surprisingly there are not as many singaporeans studying here as there are in say ukus or even the neighbouring japan i would say for undergrad students theres less than 100 of us and the rest are working so i do understand information from a singaporean can be quite hard to find \\n\\nedit 2 wow didnt expect this to blow up so much i guess singaporeans are indeed very curious about travelling and life in korea thanks for entertaining me today it was fun respite from my midterm studying those who pmed me ill get to them too hope to see many of yall on the streets of seoul soon '}, {'title': 'japanlife coronavirus megathread ii', 'selftext': 'x200b\\n\\njapan covid19 trackerhttpscovid19japancomanother tracker at city levelhttpswwwcoromapinfotokyo

create a new thread please refer to the other thread for static information this thread will mostly be updated with travel information and news\\n\\n what you can do\\n\\n1 avoid unnecessary travel to countries experiencing outbreaks\\n2 avoid contact with people who have recently traveled to above countries and crowded places\\n3 wash hands with soap frequently and observe strict hygiene regimen avoid touching your face and minimise touching random things like door handles train grab holds\\n4 if you show symptomshttpswwwmercurynewscomwpcontentuploads202003coronavirusflucoldsymptoms03122001jpg cough fever shortness of breath andor difficulty breathing or suspect that you have contracted the virus please call the coronavirus soudan hotline or your local hokenjo herehttpswwwmhlwgojpstfseisakunitsuitebunyakenkouiryoukenkouhokenjoindexhtml they will advise you on what to do\\n5 avoid spreading misinformation about the virus on social media this includes stories about home remedies like 36 hour water fasts or how people with onions in their kitchens catch fewer diseases etc\\n6 avoid hoarding necessities such as toilet paper masks soap and food\\n7 minimise travel on crowded public transportation if possible\\n8 if your employer has made accomodations for telework or working from home please do it\\n\\nregarding how to get tested\\n\\nyou cant get tested on demand you will likely only be tested if you had direct contact with a known patient have travel history to a hotspot or are exhibiting severe symptoms only a doctor or coronavirus soudan centre has the discretion to decide if you are to be tested please call the coronavirus soudan hotline explain your symptoms and enquire if you should be tested they will be able to assess and advise you on what to do better than we can if youre showing just light or no symptoms you are probably just down with a common cold and probably will be asked to minimise contact with other people andor stay home for 14 days\\n\\nnews updates\\n\\n0324govt unveils guidelines for reopening

this investigation was made by sbs and when they reached out to the government about this the bts package inclusion was deleted \\n\\ninterestingly  ministry of culture sports and tourism was

billion over the past decade according to data from hyundai research institute bts is also attracting around 800000 foreign tourists to korea each year despite the huge economic and cultural impact the government and its ministry failed to give any decision while keeping the bts member in the dark for years there were even proposals of allowing bts to enlist while being able to tour in exchange of performances that would promote the military and government propaganda in the end the members revoked their exemption and started their enlistment \\n\\n\\n'}, {'title': 'if mike trout played the rest of his career in korea  an ootp experiment', 'selftext': 'in one of the most interesting moves of this offseason the brewers signed 30 year old first baseman eric thames to a 3 year 16 million dollar contract thames hadnt played in the majors since 2012 and he was rather unremarkable when he did in 181 games over two seasons with toronto and seattle thames posted a 01 war and struck out in over 25 of his at bats so why is thames suddenly signing with a major league team especially for this kind of money the answer is because he spent the last three seasons in korea and he absolutely mashed thames had a 1171 ops and hit 124 home runs in his 2015 mvp season thames put up an absurd line of \\n381497790 with 47 homers he also stole 40 bases and was only caught 8 times and the move has paid off for first place milwaukee as thames has an impressive wrc of 137 however he has fallen down to earth it seems as that number was 107 in may and a dreadful 67 in june\\n\\neric thames is obviously a better hitter than he was five years ago but outside of the first month he has been a far cry from his korea self clearly playing abroad against weaker competition has inflated thames numbers as it has for several mediocre major leaguers such as wladimir balentien who in 2013 became japans single season home run king seeing the success of thames led me to ask an interesting question if playing in korea can turn someone like eric thames into a hitting god what can it do for the best player in the majors mike trout i decided to test this idea out\\n\\ni used ootp a highly realistic baseball simulation game to get the answers i wanted i placed mike trout on koreas kt wiz the team playing in the biggest hitters park in the league to ensure trout didnt get homesick before i was through with him i deleted the mlb and all its players and prospects the only baseball league in the world is the korean baseball organization and its superstar is mike trout at only age 24 going into the first season can the millville meteor become the greatest baseball player south korea has ever seen over the rest of his career\\n\\n\\nsee how happy he lookshttpiimgurcomg49hyy5png\\n\\n2016\\twar  105\\n\\nthere was no transition period for trout as he quickly established himself as the best player in the league winning the triple crown and mvp trout hit 324 with 31 home runs in the 144 game season his on base percentage was an absurd 507 thanks to 152 walks and 155 hits his 105 war was nearly twice as high as the second best hitter trout led the league in just about every offensive category except for total bases which was led by none other than eric thames unfortunately trouts wiz lost in the korean series to the daegu samsung lions his 370 batting average couldnt prevent the lions from winning in 7 games though the loss was disappointing trouts career was only just beginning\\n\\n2017 war  122\\n\\ntrout had an even better season than his first hitting 346 with 43 home runs and 122 war he couldnt win back to back triple crowns as he was beaten out in rbis by rockies legend wilin rosario trout was the uncontested mvp but his wiz unfortunately missed the playoffs mike trout can travel halfway across the world dominate much inferior competition and he still cant play for a winning team\\n\\n2018 war  143\\n\\nafter three years and three mvps mike trouts numbers are starting to approach insanity his second triple crown in three years he slashed 372472759 with 53 home runs and 143 war he also had a remarkable 40 game hitting streak beginning in august that stretched into september nc dinos player sungbum na is the only player who even approaches trouts numbers with 39 homers and 101 war na gets the last laugh though as his team downs trouts in 7 games in the korean series the dinos scored 4 runs in the bottom of the 8th to win the deciding game 108 and rip trouts heart out once again as a consolation trout won series mvp with a 439 average and 5 home runs in the losing effort\\n\\n2019 war  137\\n\\nin his age 27 season trout reached another level on offense but suffered his first injury trout missed the final two weeks of the regular season and the entire playoffs with a fractured thumb however he hit a ridiculous 401 with 44 home runs in 127 games to win his third triple crown and fourth mvp he slashed 401531803 for an ops of 1334 a number that would be 6th in mlb history bested by only three bonds and two ruth seasons oh and with trout on the disabled list his kt wiz won the korean series in five games with only one season before free agency this upcoming year is a big one for our hero\\n\\n2020 war  66\\n\\na testament to his abilities trout played in only 73 of his teams 144 games due to three different injuries and he still managed to lead the league in war without coming close to qualifying for the batting title his team struggled without him and finished 8th out of 10 teams in the league the writers still voted him mvp and sungbum na was forced to settle for second for the 4th year in a row\\nin the ultimate kevin durant move trout signed a 6 year 87 million dollar contract with his rival nas nc dinos trout joins the team that has won three of the past four championships with the second and third best hitters in the league na and our old friend eric thames\\n\\n2021 war  101\\n\\ntrout puts up the lowest war in a full season of his career largely due to the fact that he is inexplicably playing designated hitter he won his fourth triple crown and sixth consecutive mvp on the back of a 350468718 slash line and 50 home runs the dinos unsurprisingly swept the korean series with trout being named mvp he turned 30 during this season and to this point he has hit 357 averaging 140 wins above replacement per 162 games hes pretty good\\n\\n2022 war  112\\n\\ntrout has one of his best offensive seasons yet slashing 362504763 with 48 home runs winning his 7th mvp and 5th triple crown his war took a hit from the lack of playing a position in the field but his 1267 ops is his second best he set a career high in extra base hits with 97 for the second year in a row trout finishes with 666 plate appearances further solidifying my theory that he sold his soul to the devil in exchange for his baseball talents unfortunately his dinos were upset in the semifinals by the gwangju kia tigers named after the car company the dinos obviously felt the loss of first baseman eric thames who signed as a free agent with mike trouts former team the wiz trouts teammate sungbum na put up another 75 win season finishing  second in mvp voting for the 6th consecutive year\\n\\n2023 war  117\\n\\ntrouts career war now sits above 90 after only 8 seasons it is now a given that he will win the triple crown as he does so for the sixth time in eight mvp seasons he also leads the league for the first time with 50 doubles crushing his previous career high of 39 set last year his dinos finish 10044 cruising to their 5th title in the past 7 years teammate sungbum na finishes second in mvp voting for the seventh straight season and at age 34 2 years older than trout his chances at an award may be few eric thames has retired leaving behind a whopping 156 wrc a top 20 all time number in the mlb trouts 217 meaning he is 217 as good as the average hitter is by far the best of all time\\n\\n2024 war  136\\n\\ntrout returned to playing center field full time and posted his highest war in five seasons despite missing a week with a hand injury he slashed 376498736 to win his 9th mvp but he could not win the triple crown his team sweeps through the playoffs and trout has another ring to add to his collection he is a career 360 hitter with 384 home runs and 104 war in only 85 seasons and showing no signs of slowing down\\n\\n2025 war  117\\n\\neven though he has proven to be more than capable in the outfield trouts manager decided to move him back to dh for the 2025 season for some reason he had the type of season thats begun to be expected of him with a 1225 ops and a career high 54 home runs including his 400th trout becomes a free agent following the upcoming season he has won the championship in four of his five seasons with the dinos but the 10time defending mvp may choose to chase a large contract elsewhere\\n\\n2026 war  113\\n\\nback in centerfield the 35 year old trout may be beginning to show signs of slowing down though he hit 351 and won his 8th triple crown trouts 1110 ops was his lowest since his first season in korea he also won his 4th straight and 6th overall korean series as the lotte giants blew a 31 lead and the dinos won game 7 on a walk off double by minkook kang who hit a whopping 212 in the regular season\\nin the offseason trout signed a 3 year 35 million contract with the seoul lg twins a team sponsored by one of the countrys largest electronics manufacturers\\n\\n2027 war  102\\n\\ndespite missing nearly 40 games with an array of injuries trout had another phenomenal season putting up a slash line of 359502698 and over 10 war in a season in which he barely played 100 games he had his 2000th career hit in june and his 500th career home run in july\\n\\n2028 war  144\\n\\nwhen many thought his career was entering its twilight trout put up the best season he has ever had hitting 396 with 54 home runs trout at ages 36 and 37 had a higher war than in any season thus far in the modern era only 5 men have had a higher obp in a single season than trouts career value of 492 trout won his 13th mvp 9th triple crown and 7th ring as his twins won in 7 games in other words he is the greatest baseball player this world has ever seen\\n\\n2029 war  36\\n\\nit was a lost year for trout ravaged by several injuries he hit below 300 for the first time in his career for the first time ever he failed to win mvp the award instead went to minsu lee who led the league with 51 home runs at age 38 and entering free agency trouts days may be numbered\\nin the offseason trout chose to remain with the twins on a two year deal\\n\\n2030 war  21\\n\\ntrouts downfall was as quick as his rise missing 30 games due to injury he had the worst war of his career largely due to his diminished skills in the field though he still had an obp of 430 trout was all around the worst he has ever been failing to win mvp for the second season in a row rival and former teammate sungbum na retired following the season na finished second behind trout in mvp voting 7 seasons in a row from 2017 to 2023\\n\\n2031 war  41\\n\\nnow 40 trout is a shadow of the player he formerly was he still led the league in obp as he has done in every season in which he has qualified but he hit only 260 he hit his 600th career home run in late july but he failed to hit another over the rest of the season still valuable but no longer elite mike trout hopes to play a few more seasons in the korean baseball organization as long as his body holds up\\n\\n2032 war  67\\n\\ndefying the odds trout continues to be a solid contributor past the age of 40 it shouldnt be too surprising since many former major leaguers such as julio franco and manny ramirez have come to asia and found success playing against weaker competition in the offseason trout signed a 1 year deal with his former team the nc dinos who won 5 championships in trouts six seasons with them in 2032 trout proved he could still hit leading the league with a 448 obp and winning his 13th korean silver slugger his dinos were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs but trout has proven he is not done yet\\n\\n2033 war  25\\n\\n41 years old on opening day mike trout signed a 2 year deal with the defending champion nexen heroes he had the worst season of his career batting 225 with 8 home runs and 163 strikeouts he continues to get on base in his old age reaching at a 415 clip this is the first season in trouts career in which he does not lead the league in that category he finishes second behind minsu lee whose batting average was 110 points higher though he struggles trout remains a positive contributor and he plans to suit up for at least one more season\\n\\n2034 war  39\\n\\ntrout had a bit of a bounce back season at the plate leading the majors with a 432 on base percentage despite his 131 wrc in nearly a full season trout drove in only 31 runs for the 4th place heroes due to the fact that he only had 23 extra base hits a 43 year old free agent and on base machine trout hopes to be able to sign another major league contract meanwhile sungbum na was inducted into the hall of fame with 95 of the votes and zero mvps\\n\\n2035 war  09\\n\\nit took 20 seasons but mike trout is officially washed up after signing a deal with the doosan bears trout produced a war below 1 and a pathetic 613 ops slugging an impressively bad 262 he led the league in walks once again with 97 but he also led in strikeouts with 193 which translates to a mark reynoldsesque 217 in a 162 game season in an otherwise awful season there was celebration as trout recorded his 3000th career hit in september his personality characteristic is listed as never satisfied with his performance and in that vein the millville meteor returns for a 21st season in korea\\n\\n2036 war  17\\n\\ntrout returned to the nc dinos for a third stint with the team with which he won 5 rings he improved slightly at the plate posting an obp of 361 and a league leading 108 walks his 11 home runs were his highest in 4 years however he batted 207 and slugged 303 lowering his career average to 322 against all odds koreas goat decides to push off retirement another year and return for another season\\n\\n2037 war  11\\n\\ntrout limped to the finish line as a member of the kia tigers with a career low 183 batting average the only reason he was above replacement level was because of his league leading 118 walks trouts slugging percentage was 255 which is incomprehensibly bad especially for a 13 time mvp 46 years old and with his best years a decade behind him mike trout retires from korean professional baseball\\n\\nso what did we learn from this exercise we learned that mike trout would be pretty good if he played in korea the best ever in fact he won 7 rings and 13 mvps and played well into his 40s\\nhere are some of his career numbers\\n\\nseasons 22 19 full\\n\\nhits 3191\\n\\nwalks 2472 led the league every season\\n\\nbatting average 316 career high 401\\n\\nobp 458 career high 533\\n\\nhome runs 651 career

thought id give it a go myself hopefully its helpful or enjoyable for some of you\\n\\ni already made a post about our first week if youre interested you can find the itinerary for sept 13th to 19th there \\n\\ni will recount our itinerary and point out general information that i hope will be helpful if youre planning a trip yourself\\n\\nits going to be a long itinerary so lets give you my personal highlights of the second half of the trip\\n\\n joining a free class on tea etiquette in busan museum  we were the only participants and the teacher was very elegant and sweet it was an hour of calm in our trip and a completely new experience for us \\n hiking on saryangdo the hike was challenging but so worth it for the views and yes it even beat our hike to ulsanbawi rock \\n the food in general but especially our feast at millak fish market in busan ive never been served so much food meant only for two persons and it was affordable and delicious \\n\\nitinerary\\n\\nsept 20th  flight to busan\\n\\nwe took a morning flight to busan collected our car and made our way to gamcheon cultural village since it was raining there werent a lot of people around and after a short stroll we found a sandwich shop for lunch with a view to enjoy it was a great stop on the way from the airport but im glad we didnt go out of our way to see it since there wasnt much to see or do that interested us the colored houses are beautiful though \\n\\nit was raining more heavily so we made our way to lotte department store in gwangbok to see busan from above just a word of advice bring your umbrella since the observatory is located on the roof with no shelter the view was great though if you want to stay inside tgi friday on floor 10 has a nice view over the harbor\\n\\nwe continued to make our way to the hotel noel business hotel  affordable free breakfast and parking and close to haeundae beach and had one last stop at the millak fish market close to gwangalibeach the market didnt have a lot of visitors but you could still buy fish from the ladies they can slice it up for you then and there and you can eat it in one of the restaurants upstairs we opted to just go directly to the 9th floor instead where we found a restaurant with a view over the beach we chose the cheapest set meal they had and received a feast we really tried but even though it was really tasty we just couldnt eat all of it they also brought out the wriggling octopus dish btw which was quite the mental block to overcome \\n\\nsept 21st  busan sightseeing\\n\\nwe got up just after dawn to visit haedong yonggungsa temple without the crowds and since it was pouring we definitely succeeded even though it rained it was beautiful to see the temple in a quiet atmosphere \\n\\nafterwards we had a reservation for a free tea ceremony at busan museum remarkably we were the only participants even though our teacher was sweet and explained the basics in english and it was free go check it out  they have multiple sessions a day and its a meditative break from traveling for foreigners its easiest to drop by a day before and make a reservation in person our teacher spoke mostly korean but knew enough english to communicate what to do and why \\n\\nafter some shopping and our first bingsu we hopped on the sky capsule  reservations opened about 2 12 weeks before even though it says 2 weeks on their website and you can pay with a foreign card if you use your phone we thought itd be a bit sad to ride it in the rain since we wouldnt be able to see a lot but it was actually a welcome reprieve from the rain and the foggy exterior and high waves gave it its own mysterious character we enjoyed having a little picknick listen to music and watch the scenery change it was the one time i understood the hype on social media \\n\\nwe ended our day with trying puffer fish for the first time we went to geumsubokguk haeundae head store since it was on the way back to our hotel and thought their soup just hit the spot after the rainy day \\n\\nsept 22nd  day trip to saryangdo \\n\\ni had read about this ridge walk on saryangdo in a blog it looked challenging and like it had great views so we drove the 2h to tongyeong took the 8 oclock ferry and hopped on the bus which took us to the other end of the island the bus driver already knew where we wanted to go when he saw us and dropped us off right at the start of the trail \\n\\nand what a trail it was it was quite challenging at some parts because you walk on the exposed ridge at times but they now have easier options for people with a fear of heights or are not so sure footed we were the only foreigners there and that led to a lot of interactions with other hikers who were quite curious what we were doing there everyone seemed excited to see us and we shared a lot of food and conversations in broken korean and english it took us about 5 hours to complete the hike so we were back on our ferry at 4 pm btw  the ferry had two rooms with heated floors and that is something i wished my country would have too having a nap after the hike was amazing \\n\\nsept 23rd  gyeongju and templestay\\n\\nwe drove to daegu for our templestay experience but decided to do a detour to see a few highlights of gyeongju we parked the car next to daereungwon tomb complex and strolled around the area  we visited cheomseongdae encircled wolji pond while enjoying the views of donggung palace and finished the circle by crossing woljeonggyo bridge we spent quite a bit of time in daereungwon tomb complex enjoying the peaceful park and learning more about the silla kingdom in the cheonmachong tomb they have a few interactive displays and explain how the tombs were build and how the society lived in that time for lunch we stopped by hongsi hanjeongsik which is situated in a hanok surrounded by a beautiful garden you have to take off your shoes and sit on the floor and get served a bunch of banchans we had a sweet server who made sure we knew we could get a free refill of each dish and took the time to explain every dish \\n\\nafterwards it was only a short trip to our temple we stayed at donghwasa temple the templestay participants have their own hanok we were a bit worried at first because we only had a blanket on the floor to sleep on but we all actually got a good nights sleep you share the room with one other person but every room had their own bathroom \\n\\nthen we had an orientation where they explained the general rules and how to pray a cheerful young monk put everything we learned into practice and showed us meditation techniques as well afterwards we went straight to dinner at 5 pm the food is completely vegetarian and is eaten in silence since they consider food as an offering \\n\\nthe evening service started with the monks banging on a very big drum and then switching to other instruments a fish a cloud and a bell it was fascinating to observe  every monk had their own rhythm and technique but they gave it their all we then quickly followed them into the temple and followed along their prayer im glad i had someone i could follow because obviously i had already forgotten most of what wed learned earlier \\n\\none participant had requested the 108 prostrations so after the service we all switched to the community room and got to work for anyone who hasnt seen or done it yes you literally bow 108 times for that you kneel down and put your arms and head on the ground stand up without using your hands and start new this is preceded with a wish reflection or a resolution its quite the workout but after a while we all got into the flow and it was over before we knew it i definitely felt it the next morning though  and then it was lights out since we had to get up at 430h am\\n\\nsept 24th  drive to sokcho\\n\\nwe started our day bright and early to attend the morning service and meditation it was quite a funny sight to have a monk lead us in stretching exercises afterwards  i think ill always have the mental picture of our monk in flowing robes trying to touch his big toe whenever ill do those exercises as a warm up before sports after breakfast at 530 am we had a few hours of free time most of us took another nap or went on a little hike at 1030 am we had our closing ceremony and were released back into the real world \\n\\nit was definitely an interesting experience to live like a monk for a day and thus learn more about their lives why i didnt put it down as one of my highlights is that both of us would have loved to get the opportunity to ask a few questions about buddhism i understand that the monks have things to do but i would have been happy with asking my questions to the templestay leader or any other person with a bit of knowledge we basically blindly followed the rules and prayers without having any understanding of the reasons i think both of us were hoping to understand the religion a bit better \\n\\nafter our closing ceremony we continued our drive up north since we were back in the car a lot earlier than we anticipated we made a short detour to hahoe folk village it really is fascinating to walk along the old houses and it feels like you jumped back in time if it werent for all the cars the owners parked in front of their houses we were also just in time to see their mask dance every day at 2 pm we appreciated that they had english summaries projected so we were able to follow along the storyline it was an interesting sneak peek into a society from a different time i dont think i would have gone all the way just to visit hahoe but it was a very interesting break from our drive afterwards we hopped back on the shuttle bus to the parking area and drove the last 3ish hours to sokcho \\n\\ngeneral advice we ran into the problem that no gas station at the rest stops of the highway wanted to accept our foreign credit cards we were luckily able to pay with cash so make sure you have a little cash on hand if you pass the toll station without paying try to remember where that was  that way you can pay the full amount at the next station we also asked our car rental to check if there were any outstanding fees and we could have payed them then and there \\n\\nsept 25th  hike to ulsanbawi rock\\n\\nthe weather forecast predicted rain for the next day so hiking up to ulsanbawi rock was our priority the car park was almost full when we arrived at 9 am so we were a bit concerned for the hike but once we left the food and souvenir stalls behind we were suddenly all alone on the trail the first 23 of the hike flew by until we reached the hermitage the monk was deep in prayer when we arrived and had quite the voice so we settled in listened and enjoyed the peaceful scenery and good thing we did because the last kilometer really tested our endurance the views though  wow this is one of those views you have to see for yourself because photos dont do it justice \\n\\nafterwards we didnt feel like a lot of walking anymore so we took the cable car to gwon geum seong fortress from where we scaled the rest of the stairs to the viewing point there we had lunch while enjoying the views a lot of families were there and the kids had fun scaling the rocks it was definitely not quiet but fun to people watch \\n\\nfor the afternoon we headed for a few hours to the local jjimjilbang and hot springs you can find it by typing in  it felt a lot more local than aquafield goyang  i think we were the only foreigners the staff was very friendly we even got a face mask to wear during the bath their jjimjilbang is small but we were the only ones using it so it didnt feel cramped i liked their panoramic relaxation room the most  we spent a lot of time lounging on the bean bags overlooking seoraksan \\n\\nin the evening we walked around the neighborhood hotel business hotel camel  very futuristic and new furniture and ramen as a breakfast option a bit and ended up in abai village there we stumbled upon the ferry if youve never heard of it  the ferryman pulls the ferry across the river by himself with a wire rope and other passengers can help him a fun curiosity though nothing to seek out on its own a ride costs 500 won so its quite affordable according to the ferryman you can only get a ticket at abai village  not sure if thats true but we did only see a ticket machine on the abai side \\n\\nsept 26th  return to seoul\\n\\nwe woke up to heavy rain with no end in sight and decided to return early to seoul instead of another hike truly a shame because seoraksan national park is a beautiful place and we would have loved to explore the park more \\n\\nto at least spend some time in nature and since the weather was a lot better the closer we got to seoul we decided to do a railbike trip and ended up at gyeonggang railbike for no specific reason there are several in the area and it was the first one to pop up in naver starttimes are 9 1030 12 am and 2 330 5 pm and a bike costs 35k you ride the railbike for about 20 minutes take a break and ride it back again it isnt semi automatic though so its actually quite the exercise when you go uphill for us it was a great break from the car ride and we had a lot of fun all the other passengers we met along the way were also very cheerful and waved and cheered when we crossed ways \\n\\nback in seoul we spent the rest of the afternoon with some shopping in insadong and myeongdong and then decided to end the night with a bit of karaoke  we had a blast we went to musical noraebang it was okay they have a translation for the remote and a selection of english music which was quite dated though \\n\\nsept 27th  seoul\\n\\nwe had prebooked the morning tour of the secret garden and since our accommodation stay256 hanok guesthouse  spacious clean but shared bathroom was right at the edge of bukchon hanok village we walked through it on our way to the palace the tour was interesting and the park beautiful i actually forgot to take pictures because the guide was so engaging \\n\\nwe then had lunch at doma insadong since we were in the area to finish off our souvenir shopping the food was great but we had even more fun to watch the cooks cooking our food in open flame and pressure cookers that gave off a lot of steam \\n\\nfor the afternoon we had booked a makgeolli tasting at chunpoong brewery they specialize in high quality makgeolli and i have to say it really is good so good that were attempting to bring one back with special permission from the brewery because they usually dont sell it to tourists since the bottled makgeolli ferments a lot faster if it isnt kept cool they gave us a cooler and cooling pads and made us promise to store it in the fridge as long as possible well see if we can still drink it once were home \\n\\nafter packing we had a few cocktails at bar cham for one last hurrah  it was several times recommended here and i can do the same now they specialize in korean spirits and their cocktails are complex and innovative they were the best cocktails weve had during our trip so we definitely ended it on a high note you should reserve via catchatable if possible  if not drop by right when they open and let them put you on a waiting list korean phone number necessary  we were 5 on the list and had to wait for about 80 minutes \\n\\nsept 28th  flight back home\\n\\nand now were flying home what a trip weve had we had so many wonderful experiences here and i cant believe were already going home weve been able to actually get a feel for the culture and were so grateful for all the wonderful koreans we met along the way whove been so kind and helpful the thing im going to miss most though is going to be the food i hope i can find some good korean restaurants at home to get my fix going forward\\n\\nthanks again to this community as well it has made researching and preparing for this trip so much easier '}, {'title': 'kbs world is

developed at 2004based on france tgv with a top speed of 305kmh189mphexcept ktx eum which is at 260kmh they are the most common highspeed trains youll see\\n\\n\\n\\ncurrent map of high to highish rails in korea ktx and srt run using these lines dotted lines are under constructionhttpspreviewreddit9iriw5kjc8n91pngwidth1000formatpngautowebpse94a94e9ac74da9025c9a664d68fc80d24e283eb\\n\\neconomy seats on ktx first class seats are usually in red and they offer much more leg room note that ktxeum sancheon chungyong has better economy seatshttpspreviewredditkz2ow7g8d8n91pngwidth620formatpngautowebps4ea2bafcdacbafb54088ede6be406548aac799a0\\n\\ntips\\n\\n during rush hours ktx tends to run with two trains joined together make sure youre getting on the right section of the train if not get off at next station move to the right section of the train this is for srt as well\\n in ktxand also some sancheon not applicable to eum and chungyong go for cab 5 when booking cab 5 used to be first class when it was first built it became economy later on due to lack of demand for first class it still has better seats and better leg room\\n how do you tell if youre getting better seat by going cab 5 if you see a single seat on cab 5 it means that cab 5 used to be first class\\n however you need a korail account to select seats while booking or the system puts you in a random seat it is difficult to set up a korail account as a foreigner so unless you have a railpass if you want to select seats while booking you need to go to the station and buy tickets you are allowed to buy tickets from one month before departure\\n group purchase of ktx tickets on the computer shows a page that tells you to contact korail on the phone however group purchase on the korail appkorailtalk shows you checkout page right away while you are still unable to choose seats the system tries to assign seats so groups can sit together if it is available\\n is first class worth it first class offer water bottlesvending machine free of charge earphones and sleep maskask conductors if you can get one wet wipes snackscovid might disrupt this newspapers better seats\\n wifi is available in all seats actually all trains have wifi\\n if theres an emergency pull the red lever front or back of the car near the door this will make conductors come running also installed on srt and itx\\n they dont check your train tickets they only check tickets if the seat you are sitting is supposed to be empty this is same for all the other trains\\n overhead luggage and luggage racks are available\\n retractable seats between cars are for standing tickets the seats are first come first served\\n\\nktxchungyong\\n\\nchungyongblue dragon fleet started to operate in 2024 with max speed of 320kph198mph being faster than other high speed trains in korea\\n\\ndue to track capacity limitations they operate usually around 305kph construction is underway to fix this problem and projected to be completed by 2028\\n\\non the outside chungyong looks the same with eum but inner working is all different\\n\\n  best seats out of all high speed trains while they do not have first class and only business class is offered their business class easily outcompete first class seats\\n worked out various kinks previous versions of ktx had better riding experience overall\\n significantly more energy efficient\\n currently making stops only on seouldaejeondongdaegueastbusan which less stops chungyong has minimum transit times note some other ktx also offers minimum stop service and they have similar transit time as well\\n\\nif you can ride chungyong i highly recommend it\\n\\nsrt\\n\\n\\n\\ndespite it having a different name srt is basically ktx sancheon painted in purplehttpspreviewredditmoqkwzohg8n91pngwidth683formatpngautowebpsa99ecf7ee3b75a45141f827f6660334c1cca2748\\n\\nsrt and ktx share many similarities but differences are\\n\\n wider legroom compared to normal ktx\\n srt only stationssuseo dongtan pyeontakjije srt does not go to seoul station\\n srt runs on suseo to mokpo  suseo to busan\\n srt and ktx are run by different companies although they are working together often you still have to buy tickets on different site\\n srt first class offer all the amenities that ktx offers with an addition of mouthwash\\n srt has limited coverage of train tracks but they come by very often on tracks they travel on\\n cab 5 rule for ktx isnt the case for srt they have all the same seats except for first class\\n srt does not accept korailpass no pass is available for purchase for srtthere is but this is more of an monthly subscription of tickets\\n\\nitx\\n\\nitxsamaul this is more common type of train youll see

currently only srt are running on these tracks 82 of train tracks on this line are underground which is the second longest tunnel in korea after the entirety of seoul metro line 5 not much sightseeing

wonju jaecheon andong gyeongju starting from cheongyangli youre on this line this is a pretty old line but it is going through an extensive rework of train tracks you can see old trainsmugunghwa and new trainsktxeum running at the same time on this track\\n\\n\\n\\ngeneral tips\\n\\n try to arrive 15 minutes before train departure\\n people getting off the train has priority over people getting on wait for them to get off\\n korea has no night trains there used to be until recently no longer if you see a travel guide mentioning night trains dont plan around thatthere actually is once a month night train but i doubt anyone here will plan on using this all trains operate around 5amuntil midnightmight go slightly over midnight\\n if you see train tickets too expensive and you could bleed some time transferring trains can be a good idea osong and daejun is major train hub so you some part in highspeed train do some other part using cheaper trains give at least 10 minutes gap between transfer as trains can be delayed\\n strain vtrain samaulnot itxsamaul just samaul is another less common trains these trains can be compared to being a little bit better then mugunghwa\\n\\n\\n\\nif

of korea also known as south korea is home to over 50 million people over half live in the capital seoul making it the fifthlargest metropolis in the world what some may not know is that korea has over 3300 islands and 70 of the country is considered mountainous\\n\\nkorea is famous worldwide for its technological exports with tech companies such as samsung and lg the hallyu wave has made tv shows and films like the masked singer which the us ruined squid games descendants of the sun running man and train to busan gain audiences around the globe and the success of kpop stars like bts blackpink twice red velvet exo psy snsd super junior and more all contributing to the 14thhighest gdp in the world\\n\\nsporting pedigree\\n\\nkorean football teams are everpresent in the afc champions league and the domestic kleague is competed by 12 teams and has seen 9 different winners since its inception in 1983 koreas bestknown footballers are son heungmin and manchester united champions league winner park jisung with other icons such as ahn junghwan fired by perugia after scoring against italy in 2002 and bundesliga legend cha bumkun aka cha boom for his rocket shots  \\n\\nas a baseball powerhouse many korean players have played at the highest level in americas mlb including ryu hyunjin choo shinsoo and jiman choi korea is widely known for its pioneering and domination of the esports scene as well\\n\\nother sports korean athletes have excelled in especially at the olympics are archery shooting and taekwondo korea is also the asian country with the most medals in the winter olympics\\n\\nworld cup history\\n\\nkorea is the most successful asian football team in history having participated in ten consecutive and eleven overall fifa world cup tournaments the most by any asian country yet of the 22 nations to have played 30 or more matches at the world cup korea has the lowest win ratio having won just six of their 34 games their highest finish was 4th place in their home 2002 world cup cohosted with japan defeating the likes of italy portugal and spain with guus hiddink at the helm\\n\\noutside of the world cup korea has won the afc asian cup twice the east asian football federation championship five times and taken home three gold medals in the asian games other notable results include olympic bronze in 2012 beating archrivals japan for the medal and also knocking out hosts great britain in the quarterfinal and a fourthplace finish at the 2002 concacaf gold cup beating mexico along the way in a penalty shootout\\n\\nroad to

being the 20 miracle of kazan win over germany in the final game after losing to sweden and mexico \\n\\nperhaps the most telling effect of the desire to start fresh 18 players from the 26man squad

player in the history of the uefa champions league making his debut for valencia against chelsea at just 18 years of age \\n\\nunlike a few members of this korean team kangin is having a good season he was nominated la liga player of the month in august having moved to mallorca from valencia and scored against his old team when they played a few weeks ago \\n\\nhe has played predominantly in the center as either a second striker or an attacking midfielder for korea and in addition to this has also played on the wings for mallorca kangin is the essential utility player every squad needs in a tournament this role has been magnified with the injury to son and the worrying lack of form among the other established forward players \\n\\nbento however said his selection of lee kangin was not intended to cover for son should the korean talisman be unable to play\\n\\nkangin was in the squad for the friendlies against costa rica and cameroon but did not play kangin has so much talent but bentos stubbornness to stick to personal favorites means he has often not been allowed to impress which has frustrated many fans who can see he has huge potential\\n\\ni always believed that as long as i played well in la liga and proved i could be an asset to the national team he bento would pick me kangin said in september i will try to prove to the coaching staff and my teammates that i can contribute a great deal to the team if i can do that i believe i will go to the world cup\\n\\nhopefully kangin will be a player to watch on the field and not just warming the bench again hes still only 21  the youngest in the squad  and has a huge future ahead of him \\n\\nif qatar isnt the tournament in which he gets to show it uscanadamexico will be his stage for sure\\n\\njung wooyoung\\n\\nhe has been a regular fixture in the national team since making his senior debut in 2015 amassing over 60 caps and is an essential piece in bentos tactical style the 2012 olympic bronzewinning midfielder will sit in front of the back four and look to break up the oppositions play and can also slot in as an extra central defender if required not one to watch for fans of fancy football\\n\\nwith kim minjae behind him who is very adept at carrying the ball forward wooyoung may be seen covering for the inform napoli man should he take the ball out from the back as bento likes this korean team to do \\n\\nhe walked off the pitch with an apparent leg injury late on in the recent iceland game but should be fine injuries have been an issue as of late unfortunately and this is expected to be his final world cup\\n\\ni had some trouble ramping back up after getting injured jung has said of his left ankle and calf injuries from june ive been trying to get back to good form and ive not wasted a single day my goal is to be even better than my peak from the past and i think i am on the right path\\n\\nwooyoung has played in qatar since joining xavis old team al sadd playing alongside the legendary spaniard and subsequently playing under him when he became manager korea will hope this opportunity to learn from one of the sports alltime greats will pay off in such a tricky group where koreas midfield really could be the key to unlocking the attacking potential held by the fastpaced forward players \\n\\nlee jaesung\\n\\nanother experienced member of the side over the years with over 60 caps to his name lee has scored twice this season for mainz in the bundesliga and has been a fairly regular fixture in the starting eleven he missed out on koreas summer friendlies through injury but is back and will look to make an impact whether as a winger or an attackminded central midfielder depending on how bento changes styles should complement hwang inbeom well \\n\\nno matter where he plays he can use his speed and stamina well his goal against werder bremen earlier this season saw him make a storming run from central midfield and left completely unchecked by the defense leaving him free to pick the ball up from a pass outside the penalty area and slot it past with ease albeit with a little help from a deflection also in his arsenal is his calmness under pressure and ability to use both feet breaking out a few stepovers or a cryuffturn to get himself out of trouble a fun one to watch\\n\\nkorea has made the most out of highintensity highstamina players before most famously the legendary park jisung with the likelihood most of their games will be spent chasing possession and waiting for an opportunity to break out lee jaesung is the perfect player for such a role as hes happy to go get the ball himself and run with it as far as he needs to before putting in a through ball to an overlapping player or going for goal himself \\n\\nhonorable mentions\\n\\njeong wooyeong spent time in the bayern munich youth setup now 23 and at freiburg where the winger has 10 goals to his name and plenty of speed to burn maybe another who gets their shot during the next cycle though\\n\\nhwang inbeom versatile central midfielder has been everpresent for olympiakos this season and is a trusted lieutenant for paulo bento having moved to the greek side after consulting with the former olympiakos boss\\n\\ncho yumin if youre watching him something has gone wrong a lastminute inclusion due to injuries yumin plays for daejeon hana citizen they are in the korean second tier though they did win the league and are being promoted to the first tier he is the only member of the squad to play in the korean second tier \\n\\n\\n\\npoints of discussion\\n\\nthe tactics  bento ball\\n\\nexbenfica and sporting manager paulo bento was appointed to lead the korean team in 2018 following their disappointing world cup campaign with a contract running through the end of the 2022 world cup he has become the longestserving head coach in the national teams history but has also proved to be one of the most controversial\\n\\nbento has been criticized for his conservative tactics his reluctance to be flexible in tactical styles and player selection and his inability to play his players in their best positions all familiar stories i am sure for portugal fans during his 4 years in charge of the seleo das quinas\\n\\nunder bentos management korea has been focused on playing it out from the back preferring a 4132 or a 4231 formation he recently experimented with a 4141 with mixedtopoor results in the friendlies against brazil chile and paraguay and the eaff tournament against hong kong and japan\\n\\nin the 10 win over iceland on november 11 bento went with a back three for the first time since september 2019\\n\\nregardless of the chosen tactic the playstyle largely remained the same keeping possession in the midfield and using sweepers to get the ball moving forward often worked against more inferior teams during south koreas world cup qualifiers but against koreas world cup group stage opponents portugal uruguay and ghana the strategy may not be so effective bento has been heavily criticized for not having a plan b \\n\\nin my opinion it doesnt make sense to change our style its much worse in my opinion for us to play differently in a way that were not used to because if we dont have time to correct certain things its almost impossible to make too much of a difference  paulo bento\\n\\nin the disappointing 00 draw with iraq during qualifying forward players were often isolated when the midfield got pressed and manmarked bento then insisted on repeating the same patterns of attack relying heavily on wingbacks to try and spread the play to the lesscrowded areas of the pitch but iraq did not take long to figure out the game plan and block them\\n\\nagainst highpressing teams korea has often been outplayed and overwhelmed notably in the 51 friendly loss to brazil who dominated the press marked son out of the game and kept korea off the ball to claim almost 60 total possession the chastening 30 friendly loss to japan last year almost cost bento his job as japan pressed korea out of the game korea was unable to create passing lanes forward and the lone striker in the 4141 was isolated and ineffectual \\n\\ni admit that things didnt work out the way we intended them to in the first half we only ended up passing the ball around the middle of the field we only got a little better at it in the second half  paulo bento after the defeat to japan\\n\\nwhen it works it works well and korea has plenty of versatile attacking options but the worry is that teams can figure out their gameplan quickly and bento isnt good enough  or even willing  to find a fix this leads us to the next talking point\\n\\nthe players  versatile unbalanced and out of form\\n\\nbefore the qatar world cup there is a long way to go and there are too many homework assignments to solve the two puzzles of players and tactics when someone has a problem i dont see a player who can fill it  park moonsung commentator\\n\\nits no secret that last seasons premier league golden boot winner son is the star of this team to call korea a oneman team is unfair but it does merit some discussion \\n\\nearlier this year bento was forced to take a squad of only domesticbased players to the east asian football federation championship the tournament fell outside the official fifa calendar so many clubs did not release their star players leaving the likes of son and kim minjae unavailable korea met expectations by dispatching hong kong and china 30 each but then in their final game against japan fell 30 themselves and recorded a dismal one shot on target\\n\\nthe tournament was meant to be an audition for those domestic league players looking to stake their claim for a spot on the final world cup roster which would need this domestic depth to complement the core overseas players the final squad has 12 players who are signed to clubs outside of korea including two in the bundesliga and three in the premier league\\n\\nbut the loss to japan exposed south koreas worrisome lack of depth and together with the mixed friendly results particularly the 10 win over iceland with a koreanbased team only shows that many korean players may have a lack of experience against top opposition both domestically and internationally\\n\\nmaking things worse is that this overseas core has been struggling this season hwang heechan has not been struggling at wolves and hwang uijo has been making cameo appearances on loan for olympiakos since making the move from bordeaux to nottingham forest if goals are to be scored these players need to leave their club form behind and switch up the gears for their country especially now because the one man expected to lead this time by himself if needed is now a doubt  and who admittedly has not been having a great domestic season himself even before the injury\\n\\nin koreas favor is that kim minjae is having an outstanding season for napoli and there is plenty of young attacking talent ready to show up and show off if given the chance the worry is though like many teams that if the core isnt performing or has an injury problem can the backups really be counted on when it matters\\n\\nthe injury  risk and reward\\n\\nthe unthinkable happened son was injured playing for spurs against marseille just weeks before the world cup sustaining a fractured eye socket which required surgery this injury has thrown a huge wrench in koreas world cup preparations so close to the tournament \\n\\nweve been informed by tottenham that son heungmin had completed a successful procedure but since the surgery just took place its too early at this point to discuss his status for the world cup the national teams medical staff has remained in contact with tottenham regarding sons injury  statement from the korean football association\\n\\nson is a warrior having played with a fractured arm before it didnt seem to have a big impact on his form however this injury is very different of course\\n\\nbeing an aerial threat and scoring headers has never really been a focal part of his game his pace and technical skills on his feet have always been his strongest points and this injury is unlikely to stop him from being able to replicate this kind of play\\n\\nplayers going to a major tournament while injured is nothing new wayne rooney was in the england squad for the 2006 world cup despite his broken metatarsal he returned to action within six weeks of suffering the injury only missing out on englands opening game \\n\\nothers have played through facial injuries before notably kevin de bruyne he fractured his eye socket in the 2021 champions league final but within three weeks he was masked up and playing for belgium at the euros\\n\\nthe question is then how much of a role on the field can he play\\n\\nhe might sit out the opener or at least come off the bench to get a feel for things if hes able no doubt hes raring to go he needs just one goal to surpass the record of koreas alltime top scorer at world cups ahn junghwan and park jisung are currently tied with him as the recordholders with 3 goals \\n\\nshould son not be able to play its still a great benefit to bring him along as part of the squad he embodies korean football and can be an inspiring presence in the dressing room just as much as he could be out on the field\\n\\nwe are in contact with him with the tottenham medical department but about the exact time the exact day he can train with the team we dont have that information yet  bento\\n\\nsuwon samsung bluewings forward oh hyeongyu is also travelling with the team to qatar as a reserve player as cover for son \\n\\nhe may get his chance  even if not for son hwang heechan missed the first training session at the time of writing with what team officials have described as left hamstring discomfort fullback kim jinsu has also been battling a hamstring problem he didnt take part in any team sessions only doing individual workouts \\n\\nexpectation\\n\\nsouth koreas first group h match against uruguay is on november 24th the taegeuk warriors will then face ghana on november 28th and portugal on december 2nd all three matches will be played at the education city stadium in al rayyan west of doha\\n\\nhopefully son is able to take part despite his injury an expectation shared by the players would be korea progressing to the round of 16\\n\\nwe want to take this one match at a time and reach the round of 16 i am sure everyone on the team understands what we should do to get to that point  kim younggwon\\n\\nbut the numbers dont lie with opta crunching the numbers and giving korea an 82 chance to make the last 16\\n\\nthat lack of faith isnt shared by the players or fans who will cheer on this group no matter what\\n\\nplus with so much young talent coming through  theres always next time right\\n\\n

travellers of asian background or ethnicity have reported a spike in racist or xenophobic attacks either because people fear anyone who looks like they may be from china or simply because racists are

journey as an american living in china', 'selftext': 'ive been living in hangzhou china for more than 8 years wonderful city thats about as safe as a place can be im married to a local chinese girl weve been together for 8 years and married for 5 years we have two young children as well around november last year i decided i needed to visit the usa because it had been 2 years since my last return and i greatly wanted to see my aging grandpa\\n\\nmy wife and i decided i would take the trip alone and we would travel to usa as a family during the next summer i left and arrived in usa january 19th about one day before the major news started breaking about a novel coronavirus breaking out in wuhan and greater hubei cases were also popping up in other areas around china as well if i remember correctly in hangzhou we had heard rumors as early as late december and throughout january about a mysterious sars like disease but it sounded like rumors so hardly anyone took notice not a big deal right \\n\\ni was stateside a day maybe two and the news just swamped everything else we know the story from there they started locking down everything and more and more crazy news kept pouring out my wife was at my inlaws for the festival time just outside of the city they have a house and thankfully dont live in some tiny apartment in the middle of the city i became more and more concerned but my wife said to stay put in usa dont come back as it isnt safe the lock down got more severe and the case number exploded i was visibly nervous in front of my relatives what kind of husband leaves his family behind during a time like this everyone assured me theyd be ok and at this point there is nothing i could do i contemplated rushing back but my wife said they couldnt travel even if they wanted to staying out was the absolute safest thing they could do\\n\\ndespite the shit news i tried to have a great time with my family my siblings and i went ahead with our planned trip to costa rica which was amazing by the way many people jokingly called me corona boy my brothers neighbor told me to get out of his garage when he learned i was the one living in china i told everyone i dont live in the place that got ravaged but that didnt do much i closely monitored my health regardless and wore a mask anywhere with a crowd during my first two weeks\\n\\ni was supposed to come back to china february the 12th but obviously my return flight was cancelled the airline said the earliest they could return me to china was april 24th but they could route me to a different city if i wanted i agreed to a flight on the 18th of february to seoul south korea because news was scary about tokyo which was my only other option i was able to easily buy a ticket from seoul back to hangzhou with one layover in between i arrived into seoul on the afternoon of february 19th their time and had two nights to rest before my next flight\\n\\nmy timing is ridiculous because the night i arrived the news was starting to light up about possible infections in daegu and the 31st person being found to be infected i took a bus into incheon next to seoul and closer to the major airport i didnt want to go anywhere super populated but didnt want to waste my day in the hotel nearly 99 of everyone was wearing a mask as the worry from the previous day was hitting hard i ate a nice lunch and strolled around for a bit and bought a couple of more masks for my supply i stocked up early into my visit to usa by the way 40 n95 respirators and two boxes of procedure masks among other things after my stroll i got onto the city bus back to the hotel \\n\\nthat evening i didnt eat and just followed the news on my phone i sprayed my clothing from the day with disinfectant my suitcases too the next morning i put on my mask went downstairs for breakfast luckily the hotel was mostly empty but was perturbed because the staff werent wearing masks i took the shuttle to the airport and was off every single person i encountered wore a mask i rubbed my seat and the seat next to me with alcohol wipes when i landed in the first city in china customs was different everyone had to sign a paper declaring their health masks were mandatory and each individual was checked for their temperature and screened for any symptoms the rest of customs was easy picked up my bags and went back into the airport to check in for my next flight my temperature was checked before i got my boarding pass and again before going through security and once again before boarding the plane several hours later i arrived in hangzhou before 10 oclock and was told i would need to apply for a local health code the code keeps track of where youve been and what time if it is green youre free to move around and use local services like taxis supermarkets even return to your community if it is yellow you must quarantine for 7 days and red means quarantine for 14 days my code was green but i planned on self quarantining for at least a week before seeing my wife and kids\\n\\ntoday was day 7 no symptoms yet i think except for some reflux probably due to travel anxiety and stress ive gone outside very minimally just to buy food and water  ive had a bit of a tickle in my throat but its probably nothing other than my head messing with me at least i hope thats the case about an hour ago a guy called me up and said he works for the local government and wanted to clarify some things he came to my apartment and verified that i returned 7 days ago that i flew from usa to korea and then here i said yes sir he asked me if i was alone in the apartment and i confirmed and said my wife and kids are at the inlaws and that i am doing a self quarantine he asked me very politely to continue the self quarantine for the full 14 days he then said that i shouldnt go outside at all if i needed to get food or water or what have you that i can contact him at any time and he will have someone bring it to my door he gave me his wechat number his phone number and the number to the community office he asked me to contact him if i needed anything even just someone to talk to\\nhe told me that if i begin to feel any symptoms at all that i please contact him immediately and he would arrange a ride to the nearest hospital for the coronavirus by the way here in hangzhou they have basically designated two hospitals to handle the virus all cases go to either one of them  he informed me that it is best to begin treatment as soon as possible he assured me that i am probably in one of the best equipped citys in the world for handling this virus and to not worry hangzhou china is a very developed and modern city by the way \\n\\nmy anxiety has been through the roof lately all the news and my own worries has been stressful to say the least but that visit just now has truly put me more at ease they are so well prepared here and definitely dont want another wuhan to happen i hope that everyone reading this can be prepared and take caution but also dont let the stress take over too much cheers and good health to you all'}, {'title': 'do you ever notice regionaldated gyopo korean accents', 'selftext': 'have you ever

from daegu  for all of us though they could clearly tell who was koreanamerican  fluent but still noticeable  i find it really interesting  \\n\\nsomething else they could tell was when our families

and protestors were gathered earlier today to call for the firing of south koreas national soccer coach jrgen klinsmann and the head of the korean football association chung mongkyu  later they changed their demands and called for klinsmanns deportation  we dont want him to set his foot on the korean soil again  the only problem however is that klinsmann is already back in his adopted home country  in newport beach in the california republik  what they probably mean is that they want klinsmann to be declared a persona non grata  this is the step south korea takes to its own citizens that are draft dodgers and went overseas to evade its armed service requirement\\n\\nearlier klinsmann took part in a zoom conference call across the pacific where he learned of the recommendation that he be fired  the recommendation was made by a kfa committee dedicated to the technical and strategic review of the national team  but this is a recommendation only and has no teeth for enforcement  the final decision is in the hands of chung mongkyu  the kfa head that hails from the zillionaire hyundai jaebol family  chung is the former ceo of hyundai motors and currently heads hdc the construction arm of hyundai that builds highrise residential towers  plus he owns two kleague franchises and heads some halfdozen other positions in soccer and athletics  he is the face of korean soccer  it was was indeed chung that personally hired klinsmann  how he did so despite vehement opposition from certain kfa factions analysts and fans is now part of the lore documenting many decades of administrative incompetence of the korean football association\\n\\nhttpspreviewredditalfm1yy5rpic1pngwidth1920formatpngautowebpsf0b13665badc1047ad2803eb0e9df45b4a38b828\\n\\nhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtpp9dji7biehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtpp9dji7bie\\n\\ni

on the left is holding a wooden bar labeled bar of justice  the protestor on the right is holding a deflated soccer ball that symbolizes zerostrategy kicktheballdownthefield playing style  korean fans derisively call this type of playing style kickball soccer  in contrast with the tikitaka style of european soccer that emphasizes accurate passes and lateral movement  during its embarrassing semifinal loss to jordan klinsmanns team struggled to establish any offensive tempo and had zero shots on goal\\n\\nto understand this and other protests being staged by angry fans you have to be familiar with several recent developments surrounding south koreas national team\\n\\n former presidential candidate hong joonpyo now mayor of the city of daegu is calling for klinsmanns ouster httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfgqm4gpk2zmppyguw7zmn7ksa7zgcio2btoumsoykpounqa3d3dhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfgqm4gpk2zmppyguw7zmn7ksa7zgcio2btoumsoykpounqa3d3d  hong became famous in 2018 when he traveled to the us to make a case for south korea to develop nuclear weapons of its own  other politicians are starting to murmur and voice their concerns about the national team  yoon ally and national assemblyman kwon seongdong urged we are done examining coach klinsmanns performance  the football association has to now act  piling on the football team particularly by politicians is a national pastime only 6 weeks away from the national election  elections are typically very close in south korea agitating for the ouster of common villains klinsmann and chung could garner much needed lastminute votes\\n it has come to light that two korean soccer stars son heungmin and lee kangin engaged in a fisticuff where son dislocated his finger  this happened the night before the semifinal game  son was seen wearing a sling to keep his finger stationary during the game against jordan  other players confirmed the tiff and some players came out against lee claiming that hes headstrong and doesnt listen to senior players  some soccer fans are now pointing out why former nationalteam coach paulo bento never called up lee during his tenure as he may have noted lees disruptive behavior that went against team unity  fans of son have taken over lees instagram account and are leaving hatefilled comments to lee who has since apologized  but now they started to attack the instagram account of lees older sister who used to post and brag about his kid brothers exploits httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv5ju4zw1ohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv5ju4zw1o\\n several investigative pieces have emerged in south korea regarding klinsmanns failed coaching tenures at bayern munich toronto hertha bsc and his 6year tenure coaching the us soccer team  at focus has been his lack of strategic vision and football philosophy as well as his lax work ethic  particularly his penchant for travel to farflung places ostensibly to watch national team players play in foreign leagues  but the guy apparently liked to mix business with pleasure and his claim that hes checking out players rang hollow when he ran several businesses of his own  his business success depended on him being  a soccer celebrity  klinsmann was a cheerleadertouristcoach who liked to be seen celebrating goals but could never hold his own in the rarefied field of tactical and technical soccer  drawing xs and os to illustrate soccer formations was not exactly his forte he was a pom pomwielding cheerleader who never met a camera he didnt like  by the time his us stint was over everyone was made aware of his act except for the korean football association who may not have been sophisticated enough to tell apart a cheerleading celebrity from a technically sound and cerebral coach  httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrfhh7kik6wlistpl05hhnconqb3zpsrh2znppvjer4p2vqindex7httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrfhh7kik6wlistpl05hhnconqb3zpsrh2znppvjer4p2vqindex7\\n\\nlater the hecklers ended their protest by calling for son heungmins father to take over the national team  huh  sons dad is son woongjeong who runs a youth soccer academy in chooncheon in the province of gangwon  earlier he had left an enigmatic comment regarding his sons exploits as the korean team made it to the semifinals at quatar  the korean national team should never win the asian cup  if it does the current woes and decay mismanagement by the korean football association will continue  this earlier comment resonated with the protestors who became enraged upon witnessing kickball soccer being played in the teams onesided loss to jordan\\n\\nbut son sr has no experience coaching at the adult level  it doesnt matter  the sons are a family of saints in south korea  they can do anything'}, {'title': 'bus question ',

supposed to fly to taiwan for the long weekend but flights got cancelled due to the typhoon\\n\\nupon further browsing i saw flights from cebu to busan within that same week that would cost us less than php 6k each so we decided to push through with another trip and this time our first in busan\\n\\nwe only focused on city destinations as parents easily got tired so our stops were limited including gwanggalli beach haeundae beach gamcheon cultural village blueline park sky train cheongsapo daritdol observatory biff square\\n\\nmore than the itinerary what id like to highlight here is that we booked our roundtrip cebubusan flights only a day before and we were still able to score a php 59k airfare including baggage via jinair\\n\\nwhy cebu we are already based here so theres no need for a connecting flight to manila plus here are many other reasons to consider\\n\\n1 cebu has flights to at least 4 korea destinations seoul busan daegu cheongju\\n2 cebu is served by both asiana airlines and korean air and smaller carriers jinair jeju air tway air aerok thus increasing competition resulting to availability of lower airfares some of their flights are exclusive to cebu alone within ph some of these flights have really ideal travel times as they would allow you to have a full day both in your departure and return\\n3 even smaller carriers mentioned above are generous on handcarry luggage at 10kg\\n4 by next year terminal fee of naia will increase so if youre neither manila or cebubased youll expect to have lower airfares via cebu\\n\\ncost breakdown\\n\\n

travel tax 486000\\n grand total 5418904\\n\\nfor a lastminute flight of 3 pax i think its a pretty good deal at less than 20k per person all in few things to note\\n\\n we initially planned to do a day tour to gyeongju but skipped it though it wouldnt have cost as much either at just around 12k per pax via online sites\\n we took a number of uber rides given my companions are my elderly parents\\n accommodation was good for 3 pax so we had limited possibly more expensive options averaging at around 18k per night with breakfast\\n no visa cost included anymore as we got a

union demands are better pay better worker rotation and allowing ktx to depart from suseo station\\n\\nthe last demand is the main reason for the strike and what got the attention of all the rail fans in korea\\n\\nsuseo station opened in 2016 with the start of srt and start of competition between korail and srcompany responsible for running srt\\n\\npreviously all trains were managed by korail sr was created with huge government support because korail wasnt pulling enough dough thing is all lower class trains except for ktx arent profitable but korail cant just cancel their trains or mark the prices up for lower class trains because that would basically cut off some people in society from traveling government subsides will keep korail from going out of bushiness but they cannot rely on it forever\\n\\nseeing this korail decided to increase their ktx price instead this opened up whole new problems now some people in the government got thinking\\n\\nso we open a new rail company that exclusively run high speed trains so korail has some competition and theyll keep their prices downignore the fact that korail is forced to allocate income ktx is making to lower class trains\\n\\nthis may have worked if sr wasnt super dependent on korail\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nrelationship between korail and sr\\n\\nkorail and sr are technically in competition but korail owns 41 of sr\\n\\nsr runs srt but majority of srt are pulled from ktx trains that korail had and rebranded to srt theyre on a long term lease but the price korail is charging for the lease is absurdly cheap\\n\\nsr has exclusive rights to use suseo station meaning they soak up all the demands from southeast regions of seoulincluding gangnam and east regions of gyeonggi\\n\\nand the deal korail and sr made says in case theres an accident and srts are unable to perform normal operations korail has to cover for us using their ktx\\n\\nso yeah in competition\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nso why is ktx trying to get into suseo and is this worth a strike\\n\\nsuseobusan high speed line is a major cash cow in korean trains sr while still has a significant amount of debt is pulling in steady profit from these lines while korails debt is getting higher and higher\\n\\nlast year powerline near suseo station experinced a failure making few srt train inoperable bound by an agreement ktx trains pulled into suseo station korean rail community got loads of pictures on that day however this brought the debate on why is korail covering for srs issues and why cant we run both ktx and srt from suseo all the time\\n\\nfew months later sr announced theyll be operating independently from korail korail responded to this by so if youre really independent you know all the trains youve borrowed from us we want them back then sr backed down by saying were making more trains so were using your trains until theyre finished\\n\\nbut what really set the strike going was expansion of srs network srt trains increased their coverage to new lines but remember they only have limited number of trains this raised some eyebrows as that means less srt trains will be running on high demand route and those routes always get sold out 23 days before departure during peak hours sr responded to this saying there will be no change in train schedule\\n\\nin reality they kept the schedule same but slashed the trains in half srt during peak hours run as multi trains meaning two different trains will be joined by couplers so theyll act as one train but have twice the capacity sr basically took out half of their multi trains and run them as single trains and get the remaining trains to the new line\\n\\nimmediately frequent users of trains didnt like what the sr was doing daegu and busan which majority of these trains go to didnt like this either rail union saw this and thought nows the chance their logic does make sense though if sr is running less frequently from suseo station let ktx fill the gaps and korail will be able to fix the debt problem by profits from suseo\\n\\nso yeah thats where we are'}, {'title': 'i am solo  s18e03  ep 129  20231227', 'selftext': ' reality dating show\\n\\nin search of a marriage partner

'selftext': 'my partner and i traveled from australia to korea from the 14th to the 23rd of march we both love good food fun snacks nature especially cute animals history walking and biking our overall impression is that seoul isnt the best place to explore those interests and we would have been much better off slimming our itinerary down in order to spend time in the rest of the country im going through our itinerary again and choosing things from each day that we would recommend for people with similar interests to us along with things to discard \\n\\ntldr we enjoyed n seoul tower namsangol hanok village hongdae lotte world mall gyeongbokgung palacenational palace museum of korea and naksan park\\n\\n\\n140324\\nlanded in incheon and took the arex to the stay classic hotel myeongdong we got a great deal for around krw 110000 per night for 5 nights no complaints here its a typical 4star hotel \\n\\nthe next morning 150324 we went to namdaemun market and enjoyed kalguksu alley before walking to myeongdong lotte department store we didnt end up buying anything except for some korean foundation prices are pretty similar to what youd find in australia the funnest thing was actually hunting around the streets for popup stores\\n\\nafterwards we walked to the base of n seoul tower even though everything still looked dead from winter it was a nice view try to come on a clear day or when theres particularly nice foliage \\n\\nafter that we took the cable car down the mountain and walked to namsangol hanok village which is surprisingly free tbh pretty cool place with plenty of translations for westerners \\n\\nnext we went to korea house for dinner this was by far the most disappointing part of our trip we got the hotel to book a reservation for dinner and a seat at the performance we wanted to book the 77000 wonperson dinner but they insisted we book 200000 wonperson with a 50 deposit they gave us a 5 course meal but the portions were so small that we were still hungry at the end plus everything was so bland we eventually asked when the performance was but they said there wasnt one and blamed the hotel for not communicating with them properly even if this is true i still strongly recommend against this place because again the food sucked and they immediately put us on the most expensive course and bafflingly needed a 50 deposit even though no one else was there that night\\n\\nafterwards we walked along myeongdong walking street and bought a few things at the olive young but i didnt really enjoy any of the street foods we tried we ate a late dinner at city hof chicken 1992 and it was probably the best fried chicken we tried during our trip \\n\\nplaces to visit n seoul tower and namsangol hanok village\\n\\n\\non day 3 160324 we went to jfeel dermatology in hongdae i like that they took the time to listen to my concerns with my budget and recommend facial treatments that worked well for me \\n\\nwe grabbed lunch at saemaul and it was probably the best meal we got in seoul afterwards we walked to samoyed cafe winters village and let me tell you this was so cute some of the people including me got totally ignored by the dogs and some people got crashtackled by them not really sure why but i guess cover yourself in bbq sauce or something before you come here lol \\n\\nafterwards i went to the days hair salon to cut and bleach my hair while my partner went to cookin nanta no complaints from either of us\\n\\nwe went to hongdae walking street afterwards and ate at noo na hol dak oven chicken and beer which was easily the worst fried chicken we had in korea \\n\\nplaces to visit hongdae was very fun id recommend spending a full day here if youre into kbeauty and samoyeds\\n\\n\\non day 4 170324 we hired ttareungi bikes to ride around ill cautiously recommend ttareungi with some big caveats its great for saving time in places like jamsil and myeongdong  the other places we visited didnt have good bike paths  but overall youll probably still waste time because the app is so dodgy id recommend kakao maps for directions its good at sticking to bike paths and taking you to a bike rack so you can drop off your bike and walk to your destination \\n\\nwe first hired the bikes to ride around seoul forest park the insect sanctuary and the deer sanctuary were pretty cool even though you couldnt get too close the butterfly sanctuary is closed until may i would recommend visiting this place then\\n\\nnext we traveled to lotte world mall for some cafes london bagel museum was overpriced and overrated dont wait 2 hours for this place like we did otoh aqua garden cafe was really cool we only got two drinks there but really enjoyed the fish we also found a fun pepsi x 711 popup\\n\\nfinally we went to coex starfield mall the hyundai department store and bongeunsa temple but didnt buy anything or see anything too exciting \\n\\nplaces to visit seoul forest park after late spring lotte world mall for some cafe hopping\\n\\n\\nday 5 180324 started with a morning trip to gyeongbokgung palace for a tour and the national palace museum of korea the guard changing ceremony was pretty cool and the museum was decent we spent a good 4 hours here \\n\\nwe then bikedwalked over to bukchon hanok village and tea therapy cafe i would give this whole area a miss if youre planning to go somewhere like gyeongju\\n\\nwe went down to gaesong traditional dumpling house in insadong tasted pretty bland one of the insadong street vendors sold us dragons beard candy which gave my partner an allergic reaction even though we asked him via google translate whether it contained any nuts we bikedwalked to naksan park for the sunset but i would definitely recommend bussing it\\n\\nfinally we walked to gwangjang market i dont know if its just because we went on a monday night but this was another big disappointment most vendors were selling the same foods and it seemed expensive if you desperately want to go try another time and day for our last meal in seoul we went to soybean bone charcoal bone gamjatang bukchang around the corner from our hotel it wasnt that tasty but the aunties running the place were so sweet it made up for it\\n\\nplaces to visit gyeongbokgung palacenational palace museum and naksan park though it you have to choose between naksan park and n seoul tower go with n seoul tower\\n\\n\\noverall if youve already visited a lot of other asian metropolises seoul probably wont feel too different it might be worth it if youre a huge koreaboo or really into clubbing but i personally wasnt blown away as a comparison ill quickly go into our experiences in gyeongju and jeju and how it felt to visit them\\n\\nwe stayed at wiyeonjae in gyeongju for about 110000 won and although the futon beds were pretty uncomfortable it was quiet and very beautiful insideandout they also helped us rent bikes from a place just down the road this was such a breath of fresh air after the nightmare that is ttareungi we just gave them 10000 won and agreed to have them back by 6 the bikes were way more comfortable and had way more gears than the bikes in seoul too highly recommend getting around hwangnidan this way while exploring the tomb complex we walked into a random cafe called  and it was by far the best cafe food we had in korea we had dinner at a place called  which ended up being our favourite restaurant in korea the next day we bussed to bulguksa temple and seokguram grotto overall gyeongju is a mustvisit if youre interested in history it was everything we were hoping to get from seoul  feeling the romance just from walking down a random alleyway feeling like any restaurant we stumbled upon was gonna feed us the most delicious food wed ever tasted smelled a lot better too \\n\\n\\nwe then flew from daegu to jeju all the accommodation was crazy cheap and outside of peak hour traffic around the city i loved driving everywhere even though i felt a bit selfconscious as the lone driver on the island actually following the speed limit we found a lot more hidden gems in jeju like sarabong peak so many bunnies starbucks songdan park reserve and  while pretty much all the wellknown tourist attractions lived up to the hype we particularly enjoyed snoopy garden seongsan ilchulbong umutgae lookout the cheonjeyeon waterfalls and surprisingly the innisfree house we spent an entire rainy afternoon handmaking cute soap bars for each other and let me tell you the markets on jeju blow the seoul markets out of the water everyone was selling something unique there were lots of samples plenty of showmanship with the food before we came here i was worried we wasted money buying checkin luggage for the flight home but we were able to fill a suitcase with snacks and i highly recommend the squid ink salt bread from dongmun market im still drooling \\n\\n\\nwe went to the cherry blossom festival and enjoyed all the novelty festival stuff getting our caricatures done eating cherry blossom bread and icecream getting flower crowns there was absolutely no cherry blossoms blooming but on reflection im glad we came to korea when we did we had beautiful sunny weather every single day aside from one afternoon the weather forecast for the next week looks way worse i think we were extremely lucky \\n\\n\\noverall i wish someone would have told us to cut out half of seoul and spend time in jeonju jinhae or maybe busan instead i was most excited for seoul but ended up enjoying the rest of the country way more'}, {'title': 'travel

'continuing with my ongoing exploration of the old newspaper archives from 1945 korea that i checked out at the national library of korea in september 2023 i decided to take a closer look at some more antijapanese articles in a japanese language newspaper that was published after being taken over by a group of korean independence activists around november 1st 1945 korean employees overthrew their japanese bosses at gyeongseong ilbo keijo nippo the colonial era newspaper that had served as the main propaganda newspaper for the whole of colonial korea from 1909 to 1945 the korean independence activists subsequently continued the publication of this newspaper in japanese with an avowed korean nationalist editorial stance until december 11th 1945 as the korean employees of keijo nippo explained in their message to the readershttpswwwredditcomrkoreacomments16s4lfzkoreanstaffatkeijonippotookovernews this was a temporary measure undertaken while korean typefaces were being prepared for eventual use\\n\\nthese are a few short articles from november 1945 that give you a rough feel of what the attitudes of koreans towards the japanese were like back then there was apparently a feeling that the wealth that the japanese people amassed during the colonial period was illgotten so the editors looked on with disapproval at any attempt by the japanese to sell their things for cash to take back to japan they even viewed any korean who helped the japanese liquify their assets as traitors naming one individual in particular to publicly shame lee bokdong whose name is also written on the signage above the door in the news illustration of tanaka store there is also a report about japanese people who were attempting to illegally travel from japan into korea next to that story is

goes without saying that japanese cannot travel freely to korea recalling the times when even we who were once called imperial subjects needed certificates to travel it is unreasonable for the japanese to think of korea as their own territory and attempt to illegally travel for an easier life there because of inconvenient circumstances in their own country enduring inconvenience and hardship should be the way for the japanese to live on this matter colonel stilwell states that under the current situation japanese are fundamentally not permitted to travel to korea\\n\\nthose with unavoidable circumstances must obtain permission from the allied authorities and possess a permit to travel if the number of japanese attempting to travel to korea increases in the future a ban on

first impression of the members in a man in his 30s trying very hard to not cringe review of bts raising game\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nthe inevitable time has come\\n\\non the evening of 26th this was my thought as bts world server opened   i had flashbacks of the times i had confidently told my colleagues that i will withstand this game  my colleague reporters were already fallen from not being able to tolerate the previews before the game came out  it was up to me to do it\\n\\nhonestly i had confidence one time i had been exposed and survived a lot of other examples while doing research on the market targeted at female gamers  i even did a bit of prep work doing the superstar bts game  i tend to listen to idol songs regardless of gender if the songs are good  i pressed play  bts my friends since im the manager youre gonna have a full schedule\\n\\nbts world is a cinematic simulation game of upbringing collecting and exchange  in the play the story takes a large portion and the data volume of the game is beyond imagination\\n\\nthe play is similar to chinese female oriented dating simulations love and producer by paper games  to share phone calls text and communicate by sns as well as to clear missions with card levels  in conclusion you need powers of fighting against the evils of cringe  although the manager that keeps trying to cross the line made me a bit nervous i tried to pick the most rational choices and build my affinity\\n\\ni thought i would be able to withstand it but it wasnt easy  the beginning was especially a bit of a crisis  why do we get one liners on a shiny background of things like copper tanned skin charismatic eyes or skin like white jade  in addition these are not even about fictional characters but of people who actually exist\\n\\nwriting this while squirming and wailing\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nwhile playing this game i focused on the game system as much as possible and regained my calm  im just a gamer that is raising up fictional characters  2012 is just another universe that the protagonist fell in  its just another possible past of the 14 million pasts that dr strange saw  selfhypnosis with these thoughts gave me peace\\n\\ni had noticed it while playing superstarbts as well but its not easy to tell people apart when theyre all styled like an album cover  many men dont really pay attention to faces of other men  it was my first  hurdle to become an army  army will know who they are even by looking at their shadows  as if to say this there were a lot of ux design that didnt tell me the name of the character  as a beginner i had no choice but to learn them\\n\\nfinally after learning the faces and characters of the bts members im writing down the initial impressions of the 7 members  these are just personal impression  im up to chapter 5 of the story\\n\\njin  he seems like a protagonist in a romantic comedy  with elegant impression and figure he is an ideal of a handsome man  there are not many things in the world that men hate as much as actual handsome men saying theyre handsome all the time  but whenever he opens his mouth there is something not quite all there about him  this must be his unexpected charms  he was so unexpectedly funny that i ended up actually laughing out loud a number of times  his character as the luxury version of the common neighborhood hyung is quite unique as well\\n\\nsuga  he seems to be the tsendere rule enforcer  during another story the genre suddenly changes into beethoven virus kdrama  he becomes suddenly the most serious person in the world when music comes up as a topic  did they say a man who has focus on his work is sexy  he seemed to hate bangtan sonyeondan group name the most i understand him  if you think hes a bit too sensitive he shows his caring side while pretending to be not caring  it felt like a female heroine from a typical maletargeted game had gotten swept in a storm and fell into a typical femaletargeted game\\n\\njhope  even when he is not in the centre of attention i could see he was always smiling  he doesnt say things that stand out too much  he has the aura of being able to mingle and get along well no matter which group he falls into  in the game he seems to be the type of subcharacter that is protagonists brother or hoobae that cheerfully leads the protagonist a few times  his cards especially seem to have poses that express im cute\\n\\nrm  he showed charisma even from the beginning of the game  if i met him in real life i would probably call him hyung  in reality anyone who seems more powerful is really the hyung  i thought he would be a sports man but it was interesting to find out he was studying creative literature  i also felt camaraderie when he kept losing or breaking things  he seems to be good at writing and is very logical  i would like to nominate him as potential winner if there were a keyboard battle contest\\n\\njimin  when i first saw bts i thought he was the youngest  he is cute and i really like his eyes  he appears as the grandson of a rice cake business and i think he would have fit well even if he really went into that business  i was surprised he had good acting in the another story  he seems to be the type that does everything well when given the chance  he was so attractive when he was wanting food it made me want to buy him a meal  his reactions are always good so teasing him seemed most satisfying  if i could have one of them as a younger brother i would choose jimin\\n\\nv  i really dont know  i cant define his character no even his mental world is not of this world  the speech does not go in introbuild upclimaxresolution but introresolution  character deoni dalbi in a book by lee youngdo had this type of speech and i didnt know i would meet such person in real life  if i were to live with someone like this life would never be boring  of course life would also never be peaceful but   when he wrote the lyrics glassmentality boy i liked his artistic emotions\\n\\njungkook  hes the youngest and he really does act like the youngest  the conversation images seemed to have been made to be especially cute  unlike jimin i feel like he would be hurt if i tease him so i cant tease him  initially he seemed like a kid who wanted to be mature but later on i could see a bit of that maturity as the character seemed to grow his image in the cards at times were so different that sometimes i could not recognize him  when hes smiling sometimes hes difficult to distinguish from jhope  he suddenly seems very dependable when he starts singing\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nx200b\\n\\ntime travel to 2012 is a bit of a cliche premise  the fact that we know they become world stars neutralizes the limits of idols in reality  as the protagonist already knows the future the player can focus on the details of each step as they naturally reach that point along the way\\n\\neven now i have each members profile up beside me as im working hard on this game  ive even found an error in the process v is from daegu but when he goes to the countryside he uses jeolla satoori  but outside of that i can see that they put in a lot of effort to be consistent with many things about bts  and it was interesting to play another story of what may have happened to the members if they did not become bts\\n\\nthe flower thats used to level up the cards is smeraldo and its a flower that doesnt exist created by bighit to sound like it existed to be used as hints in bts worldand many other tmis have been absorbed into my brain now  i might

in a lot of effort and looks like a scene from a drama  the acting by members look natural too  the talk bubbles were the only part that was a bit difficult to watch\\n\\nbts world exploration has just started for me  since ive survived the trials and tribulations of adjusting to the game i will play this as far as i can  next article youll be able to see an ajussi manager in his 30s training

 but one of the most interesting stories actually comes from k league 2\\n\\nfor context you need to understand a bit about military service for footballers rather than take 2 years out of their career to serve in the military or do some kind of eg desk job service players can join one of two military football teams that play in the k league in k league 1 there is sangju sangmu and in k league 2 there is asan mugunghwa every player in these two teams is on loan for two years from another club in the k league sangju sangu is affiliated with the normal military whilst asan mugunghwa is affiliated with the police serving in the auxilliary police force is another way to do your service\\n\\nthe korean government recently decided to abolish the auxilliary police force by 2023 the police however decided to already wind down their sports teams putting an immediate halt on recruiting players and disbanding the teams in 2019\\n\\nnow the champions of k league 2 last season were asan mugunghwa they were in line for direct promotion to k league 1 to compete in the k league you need to have at least 20 players but by the time the next season started asan would only have 14 players as the loan deals ran out the league gave asan a deadline in november to submit a recruitment plan which they failed to do and so the promotion spot passed to secondplaced seongnam fc although that deadline and hence promotion was missed asan have how submitted a recruitment plan that would see their 14 serving players be supplemented by new signings that indicates the club will transition to an cityowned club with the help of the asan government\\n\\nfunnily or depressingly this is not the first time police fc won k league 2 and missed out on promotion  in 2016 ansan mugunghwa were crowned champions but at the end of that year moved from ansan to asan in line with the leagues policies they were registered as a brand new club\\n\\nk league 1 club guide\\n\\nclubs can have up to three foreign players in their squad plus an extra one from another afc nation although rare a player with north korea citizenship is not considered foreign most of those foreign places are taken by brazilians or players from the former yugoslavia eg k league veteran dejan damjanovic the exception to the foreigner rule is the goalkeeper  korean goalkeepers in the 90s were just so bad that a block on recruiting foreign goalieshttpwwwkleagueunitedcom201703foreigngoalkeepersinfavourofhtml was put in place to help encourage development of domestic talent it seems to have worked with korean goalkeepers often being signed abroad in asia at least\\n\\nthere is also a requirement to have u23 players fielded and on the bench with a failure to meet this impacting the number of substitutes that can be made article 30httpswwwkleaguecomaboutcompetition of the league rules\\n\\nyoull notice some of the clubs have a korean chaebol in their team name and even if its not in the name they may still be owned by a corporation behind the scenes this sounds very odd if youre not familiar with it but it is extremely common in japan china and korea it may just be a symptom of some of the teams being relatively recentlyfounded and perhaps isnt that unusual these days think red bull city group majority shareholders in the west however the number of citizen clubs owned by the local city or provincial government is on the rise  gyeongnam fc is one example\\n\\na lot of clubs probably like to think they have a derby with fc seoul because well its seoul but the  biggest and probably considered the national derby is the super match  between fc seoul and suwon samsung bluewings montenegrin damjanovic known simply as dejan formerly of seoul and now playing for suwon is the top scorer in this fixture\\n\\nheres the clubs by last seasons standing and since crests are a bit unstable on reddit at the moment heres an imgur album of all club crests and corresponding home kits for the 2019 seasonhttpimgurcomaw8dbla5\\n\\njeonbuk hyundai motors\\n\\njeonbuk are the dominant team in korea and one the of the teams you dont want to face in the champions league whoever you are theyve now won 4 out of the last 5 k league 1 titles and a most recent champions league title in 2016\\n\\ntheir rise to power over the last decade has been overseen by long term manager choi kanghee choi left at the end of last season to tianjin quanjintianhai daliang yifang fc in china korea seems to have a thing for portuguese managers these days and his replacement is one jos morais morais was assistant manager to jos mourinho for a period but as manager proper hes been a bit shit he was at two clubs in 2018 which included ushering barnsley into relegation to english league one how jeonbuk will fare after choi remains to be seen\\n\\nalthough jeonbuk cruised to the league title it would be difficult to call their season an outright success due to a horrendous 15 mins at the end of the second half in a home match against suwon in the champions league quarterfinal they turned the 3 goal deficit around in the seond leg when they travelled to suwon but went out on penalties \\n\\ngyeongnam fc\\n\\ngyeongnam were only promoted from k league 2 the previous season so coming second in k league 1 is something special top scorer in the league marco played his part with 26 goals\\n\\ngyeongnam will now feature in the champions league for the first time i thought that seems to have put the brakes on too many of their players departing but captain choi youngjun signed for jeonbuk in the winter transfer window a major loss is marco who was also top scorer in k league 2 in the year they were promoted who appears to have followed the money to china also off to china is key centreback park jisoo so basically the backbone of the team from defence to attack has left\\n\\nulsan hyundai\\n\\nknown as the horangi   the tigers  ulsan have had intermittent success in asia winning the champions league for the first and only time in 2012 in an unbeaten run\\n\\ntowards the end of the 2018 season ulsan were battling gyeongnam for the second spot which brings with it direct qualification to the champions league group stages rather than having a playoff they lost out but were widely expected to secure a direct qualification spot anyway when they faced daegu fc in the fa cup final ultimately they finished the season on a low losing 51 on aggregate to daegu in the final \\n\\npohang steelers\\n\\none of the few clubs that predates the formation of the k league pohang are another of the historical korean powerhouses they hold the record for the most number of champions league title 3 but their last title came in 2009\\n\\nfinishing fourth in the league they were hoping that ulsan would beat daegu in the fa cup final to pass their champions league spot on down but it didnt happen\\n\\njeju united\\n\\none of the original members of the k league founded as the yukong elephants in the seoul area as part of the decentralisation program they moved to bucheon kind of and were renamed as bucheon sk the decision to move to jeju in 2006 was an abrupt one and understandably deeply unpopular with the fans teams uprooting and moving elsewhere is a bit of a catalyst for the creation of new teams in korea and the fans formed bucheon fc 1995 in the absence of bucheon sk\\n\\nthe reason given for the relocation was to the address the imbalance in football teams being located around seoulgyeonggido and jeju did not have a pro team at the time but there are suggestions the owners sk group wanted to cut their investment and recoup some costs\\n\\nthere were recent rumours that jeju would move yet again back north to yongin but who knows \\n\\njeju had a pretty mediocre season what more can i say\\n\\nsuwon samsung bluewings\\n\\nsuwons 2018 season was a bit bonkers and especially so in their champions league run\\n\\nin their champions league group in which they were drawn with eventual winners kashima antlers suwon did not manage a single home win however they had managed to get two away wins and going into the final match they still had their fate in their own hands if they could win against group leaders kashima in japan they won 10 getting three away wins and topping the group\\n\\nmanager seo jungwon at a time when suwon were 4th in the league resigned the day before the first leg of their champions league quarterfinal clash with jeonbuk due to fan protests jeonbuk were apparently completely bamboozled by this event and took a 30 beating at home then in the return leg in suwon jeonbuk fought back to win 30 but suwon were able to scrape through on penalties to face kashima antlers yet again in the semis\\n\\nin the semifinal fixture suwon went 20 up against kashima antlers inside the first 10 minutes but went on to lose 32 in the first leg\\nsoon after manager seo returned as suddenly as he had departed having been gone for just 6 weeks  \\nin the second leg suwon went a goal down in the first half but came back with 3 in the second half to be on their way to the final after 60 mins played however kashima antlers fought back to get two more goals and win 65 on aggregate and would go on to win the final if you want to relive a part of that rollercoaster night here you gohttpsyoutuberxy8pagy1aq and heres an idea of the atmosphere that nighthttpstwittercomtheafcclstatus1055055104607285248\\n\\nat one point it looked like they might qualify for the champions league again for the 2019 season but suwon didnt win any of their final five league matches and dropped to 6th\\n\\nmanager seo left again at the end of the season and will manage japans sagan tosu recently captain kim eunsun was released from the club for drinkdriving the drama just never ends\\n\\ndaegu fc\\n\\nprior to the world cup daegu were languishing at the bottom of the table but after the return they found some kind of consistent form helped out by world cup hero goalkeeper jo hyeonwoo they really peaked at the right time as daegu made it to the fa cup final and against the odds defeated ulsan hyundai 51 on aggregate meaning for the first time they will feature in the champions league this is no mean feat for team whose best ever finish in the top flight is 7th place if they carry over their momentum into the 2019 season the year could be one of their most successful ever they will also be playing in a new footballspecific stadium this year\\n\\ngangwon fc\\n\\ngangwon are a fairly midbottom team i dont really know what to say about them they did have the 2ndhighest top scorer in the 2018 season though bosnian uros deric they also had the worst colour scheme in the league last season their kit is slightly improved this season\\n\\nincheon united\\n\\ni always like to imagine that incheon chose their strip so that they could be the inter to fc seouls ac milan they even have a nickname nerazzurri another nickname is the durumi    the cranes\\n\\nincheon spent most of the 2018 season at the very bottom of table and had the jointleakiest defence in the league they brought in norwegian manager jrn andersen midway through the season to turn their fortunes around but even after that they were on the wrong end or the biggest thrashing of the season 70 against gangwon coming into the end of the season though they were playing really nice attacking football even if they didnt always get the result at the split they were still bottom but won 4 out of 5 games to pull themselves up 3 places\\n\\nit was in attack that incheon shone montenegrin stefan mugosa was their top scorer in his debut season moon seonmin with the best goal celebration in the league also put in a strong performance but has now signed for champions jeonbuk nam junjae returned in the summer to score some bangers costa rican international aguilar was also impressive but has signed for jeju in the new season\\n\\nsangju sangmu\\n\\nthe military team where other k league players get loaned to to complete their military service their history goes far back in one sense as various military teams were playing way back to the 50s but they were founded for pro footballers to serve their time only in 1984 although they were for pro players they competed in the semipro national league until 2003 when they joined the k league based in gwangju when gwangju fc were formed they moved to sangju\\n\\nsangju sangmu do not have any foreign players for obvious reasons and cannot compete in the champions league although the chances of ever finishing in a qualifying spot are fairly slim\\n\\nfc seoul\\n\\nfc seoul wow what happened having won the league in 2016 albeit somewhat fortuitously and always finishing in the top half if not competing for the title in the past decade nobody expected seoul to be fighting against relegation although relatively solid defensively they scored the least number of goals in the league season of all teams their star foreign players almost all left before the season started including dejan to rivals suwon and were not replaced with the same quality and for many matches seoul played with an allkorean team one bit of good news for the future is that former captain osmar will return from his loan to cezero osaka for the new season\\n\\nseoul at least managed to avoid relegation by beating busan ipark over two legs in the playoff helped by a red card in the first leg surprisingly they managed to score 3 goals in the first leg in open play\\n\\nseoul is probably the most popular club in korea im sure helped by the fact that it is the main club in a city of 10 million people  seoul generally has the highest game attendances although it was much reduced last season because they were so crap\\n\\nstarting out as luckygoldstar ie lg fc in chungcheong province the team was permitted to relocate to seoul at the start of the 90s and were renamed as lg cheetahs during the decentralisation

exporterhttpsenynacokrviewaen20190131006600315sectionsportsindex of players in asia in the transfer market this winter window was no different with what i would say were the two biggest stories involving young homegrown korean talent going abroad\\n\\nthe first is that of jeonbuk and national team star centreback kim minjae nicknamed the monster there were rumours of an offer from english side watford but it wasnt clear if there ever was any offer or negotiations  kim himself said he did not know of any interest from watford it doesnt really matter now  kim signed with chinese side beijing sinobo guoan and will see champions league football with them in the new season being drawn in the same group as jeonbuk\\n\\nthe second is hwang inbeom who has signed for mls side vancouver

left gyeongnam for hebei china fortune and his replacement is luc castaignos signed from sporting cp his stats in europe havent been great in recent years but he may fare better in korea\\n\\nthere were of course a few hundred domestic internal transfers and number of other foreign player signings  if you want the full list k league uniteds winter transfer trackerhttpwwwkleagueunitedcom2019012019kleaguewintertransfertrackerhtml has it all\\n\\n\\n\\nhistory of club football in korea  establishment of the k league\\n\\nassociation football was first introduced to korea in 1882 when british royal navy crew harboured at incheon played a game it wasnt until the 1900s that football began to take hold and the first public match was played in 1905 there was a boom in in the 1910s with a number of football clubs being formed and rivalries began to form between clubs in seoul and pyongyang\\n\\nthe first nationwide competition was the all joseon football tournament joseon being the name for korea at the time founded in 1921 there wasnt actually a champion crowned in 1921 as the tournament was cut short due to complaints over refereeing decisions all this was taking place during japanese occupation of korea during most of the first half of the 20th century\\n\\naccording to the kfahttpswebarchiveorgweb20170606162658httpkfaorkrrecordhistoryasp football was the only tonic that could relieve the the national resentment that had accumlated in the hearts as a colony under the japanese empire and was a sprout that could foster the hope of freedom a tad hyperbolic maybe\\n\\none side effect of being a japanese colony is that some korean teams were allowed to participate in the emperors cup japans fa cup and in 1935 kyungsung fc kyungsung was a name for seoul during japanese occupation won the tournament becoming the only nonjapanese team to ever do so\\n\\nthe all joseon football tournament ran until wwii\\n\\nafter wwii came korean independence and shortly thereafter the korean war there was football being played during this period continuously when possible the korean national semiprofessional football league was founded in 1964 and is the predecessor to todays tier 3 national league many of the teams during this period were works teams  employed by a company playing under the name of the company but also having a proper job in the company cha bumkun said by some to be the greatest ever asian footballer rose to fame during this period albeit mainly in the bundesliga starting his senior career at the mighty seoul trust bank fc the most astonishing statistic about cha bumkun is he only received one yellow card in his career\\n\\nfinally we get to the establishment of professional football with the korean super league in 1983 now named the k league initially there were only 5 teams and 2 of those teams dropped out within 2 years the number of clubs in the top flight has varied from the initial 5 to a high of 16 in 2011 in 2013 the k league split into two tiers now k league 1 and k league 2\\n\\nfor the first few years of the k league teams did not have a fixed home stadium that they played in because there was no standard homeaway format that we are so familiar with today instead it was operated as a national tour\\n\\nthe k league in the modern era has its own history but one of the most interesting events was the forced exodus of all three clubs from seoul in 1996 as part of a policy to spread the popularity of football around the country also with an eye on stadium infrastructure for the 2002 world cup two of the clubs didnt move far only just outside the city of seoul each to one of seouls satellite cities yukong elephants only halfleft because the city they moved to didnt have a stadium yet so they continued to play in seoul until a new stadium was built for a number of years the k league was without any seoul representation in 2004 after the need to find someone to fill a great big national football stadium and help pay towards it one of those relocated teams moved back to seoul becoming fc seoul\\n\\n\\n\\nfootball pyramid  league format\\n\\nthe current system looks like this\\n\\n\\n tier  league  notes \\n\\n 1  k league 1 12 teams 1 relegation to k league 2 1 relegation playoff with k league 2\\n 2  k league 2  10 teams 1 promotion to k league 1 1 promotion playoff with k league 2\\n 3  national league  8 teams semipro no promotionrelegation\\n 4  k3 league advanced  12 teams semiproamateur 2 relegations to k3 league basic 1 relegation playoff with k3 league basic \\n 5  k3 league basic 11 teams semiproamateur 2 promotions to k3 league advanced 1 promotion playoff with k3 league advanced \\n 6 division 5 league 6 regional leagues with 52 teams some relegation to division 6 \\n 7  division 6 league 26 regional leagues with 174 teams some prorel with divisions 5  7 \\n 8  division 7 league 160 regional leagues with 960 teams some promotion with division 6 \\n\\nas you can see the naming is completely screwed up  k3 league occupies tiers 4 and 5 and division 5 is in tier 6 this is probably because the top tier k league only split in two in 2013 with the creation on k league 2 and nobodys been bothered to update their names\\n\\nthe national league sits stubbornly in tier 3 blocking any continuous prorel the powers that be have regularly stated that they want to reform the pyramid to have a continuous route from top to bottom at least to the bottom of k3 league within a few years but for some reason its not happening the winners of the 2006 national league season were offered promotion to the k league but they declined the offer the winners of the 2007 season were also offered promotion but declined again even though they said they would like promotion at the start of the season\\n\\none of the more recent additions to the k league bucheon fc 1995 joined from k3 league because they didnt want to pay the higher fees associated with starting out in the national league\\n\\noutside of this system there is the wk league the womens top tier the wk league has been dominated by incheon red angels no connection to incheon united in recent years theres no womens champions league in asia yet but for a few years in the past the winners of the wk league played the winners of japans nadeshiko league for a little more info on the wk league see this reddit posthttpswwwredditcomrwomenssoccercommentsaqkew5southkoreasroutetotheworldcupthewkleague\\n\\nalso worth a mention is the separate u league for universities and colleges some of the teams from which enter into the korean fa cup the route into a pro team in korea is often direct from high school or university teams something i dont think exists in europe some high school teams are even seen as feeder teams for a particular pro team i wont pretend to understand how the system works but ill leave you with the tidbit that park jisung was first signed to a professional team from a university team almost by accident as the scout had come to see a different player but took home park instead\\n\\nk league 1\\n\\nk league 1 consists of 12 teams playing 38 games the format is identical to the scottish premiership  all teams play each other three times and then after the split the top 6 and bottom 6 battle it out among themselves to settle the championship and relegation spots respectively the first tie breaker for teams level on points is goals scored rather than goal difference\\n\\nthe top 3 places offer a chance in the afc champions league the fourth champions league spot going to the winner of the korean fa cup bottom place gets relegated to k league 2 whilst 11th place has a playoff with one of the teams that finished 2nd4th in k league 2\\n\\ninternational context\\n\\nin the current format of the afc champions league the competition is split into a west region think uae saudi arabia qatar iran and an east region the east region is dominated by three nations  korea china and japan australia who decided it wanted to be asian earlier this century has also had a bit of success\\n\\nthis year there will be two debutants from korea  gyeongnam fc and daegu fc its dufficult to predict how well these two will fare but if they can carry some form over to this year they could get out of the group stages at least\\n\\ndetermining who has the strongest teams amongst the big three east asian nations is a difficult task and is hugely subjective im almost i say almost because obviously k league is best league of the opinion that theyre as close to equal as makes no difference korea has the most number of titles and the club with the most titles pohang steelers china have the highest coefficient japan has won the past two tournaments\\n\\nin recent years china and japan have had a number of big star foreigner signings eg paulinho torres which are absent from the k league i believe this is due to japan having cash mainly coming from tv money and china having cash from well being china despite korea lagging financially all three nations have the same limit on foreign players three foreigners plus one from another afc country and so korean teams are still competitive due to the relative strength of their domestic players\\n\\nwhile were on the topic of the champions league each of the big three east asian nations get 4 places total  2 or 3 to the group stages and 1 or 2 to the last qualifying playoff round before the group stages this playoff round is massively weighted in the big threes favour as they have to win just one home game when the weather is still genrally freezing cold against a team from a nation with a tropical climate i dont know of a korean club ever losing this playoff match\\n\\nthe afc cup is sometimes said to be the equivalent of uefas europa league but its not really comparable the afc cup is for the weaker asian nations only and korea arent allowed to enter\\n\\n\\n\\nresources\\n\\nwebsites  podcasts\\n\\nfor those of us

channelhttpswwwyoutubecomuserspotv spotv is a korean sports broadcaster they also upload content from the kbo baseball and the v league volleyball so youll have to scroll down until you see something

will be in korean but each video is really good quality typically about 10 minutes long\\n\\nif you watch to watch live the good news is that is very easy and basically free i have no idea whether any national broadcasters or streaming services around the world have k league rights but in korea itself essentially every thing is streamed on korean online behemoth navers platform the one caveat is that live streams are region locked so to access them youll need a vpn to get a korean ip address although some other asian countries also seem to have access i wont repeat what others have already

gimhae airport during check in we were informed that there would be a limit on masks  up to 30 per person and they could only be in your carry on bags  cant be in your check in luggage  my mother in law is a seamstress and made us 40 masks from cloth  the idea was that we buy our own filters which we would then cut them down to size and insert them in between the opening she made between the 2 pieces of cloth  on top of the 40 home made masks we had about 38 kf94 masks that we bought  we thought we were in the clear since we had home made ones but the airport officials said nope  we had to take out 18 masks  we argued to no avail we had our temperatures taken at the check in counter and passed through immigration  an hour later we boarded the plane to icn\\n\\nat icn we were led directly to the main terminals and there werent many people around  when we landed all we could see were rows of korean air planes parked on all sides and just a couple of foreign airliners so we expected there was not gonna be a lot of people but it shocking to see we waited at the lounge until it was boarding time and headed to the gate   we were then questioned by an airport worker who asked us if we had been to the hospital in the past 2 weeks whether or not we went to daegu or been around somebody that had coronavirus  then we boarded  the flight was about 50 to 60 full and everybody had on masks except for the majority of the non asians  after the 10 and a half hour flight we landed at lax and i was kinda shocked of how relaxed all the workers were  nobody wore masks and at the immigration counter the officer asked which country are you traveling from korea and he replied great welcome back  he didnt take my temperature nor asked me if i had been to daegu etc  leaving korea was harder than coming back the us so i asked him how the situation was at the airport and if he was worried  he replied that he was but theres nothing he could do  but he said the

to the pandemic so your mileage may vary only attempt this if you already have a visa or youre willing to risk being turned away at the airport\\n\\nhey everyone i just entered korea on a b2 tourist visa with a usa passport and am currently fulfilling my 14 day quarantine at a designated facility in the outskirts of incheon before coming here i searched some posts about what to expect and could not find a full guide ive seen a couple other posts asking what its like so i decided to write up my experience so others are prepared for what to expect\\n\\nbefore flying to korea\\n\\nat baggage check in the counter staff will\\n\\na verify your passport is not on the banned countries list\\n\\nb tell you theres quarantine upon arrival and make you sign a quarantine agreement\\n\\nc ask you to download the self quarantine app they show the qr code\\n\\nd ask for proof of onward travel\\n\\nthe airline staff didnt believe me when i told them i didnt need a visa to korea it took me 5 mins of explaining to convince them\\n\\nat the gate the staff give you a stack of papers to fill out\\n\\na arrival card  traveler goods declaration forms the usual when you fly to korea\\n\\nb health declaration form asks you to list your recent medical symptoms for the past 21 days\\n\\nc travel record declaration form list all countries you have traveled to in the past 21 days\\n\\nfill these out on the plane before you land\\n\\nlanding in korea\\n\\nnote after you get off the plane i recommend you stop by the toilet cuz youll be in lines for the next hour\\n\\nfollow the crowd of people to the massive line for the quarantine booth it took me 30 mins to get to the front at the booth the staff will look at your passport health form and travel record forms they will take your temp and send you to the next station if your temp is above 375 youll be taken aside\\n\\nat this point the line splits 3 ways 1 way for citizens 1 way for transit passengers and 1 way for foreigners entering i went the last route this led to a room with several booths manned by rok army staff wearing gloves and masks\\n\\nthe first booth they ask you what country you are from they check your passport and boarding pass then they give you some forms to sign that explain you understand youll be quarantined for 14 days what you can and cant do during quarantine and give you a pamphlet with quarantine instructions they give you a big lanyard to wear that says what country you are from\\n\\nin the second booth theyll go through the self quarantine phone app with you and set it up theyll explain youll need to fill out your tempsymptoms 2x per day morning and night for the next 14 days theyll fill out your first temp reading on the spot so you can see how its done\\n\\nthe biggest surprise i had here was when setting up the app you are required to have a quarantine point of contact this is someone theyll call if youre sick and get hospitalized or they have issues reaching you during quarantine this person must be someone living in korea with a korean phone  you cant give a fake number or your own number because they call the number on the spot and ask if they know you i messaged a friend and asked if he was cool with being my point of contact to which he said yes i gave the staff his phone  the staff called him and got it sorted out\\n\\nin the third booth youll fill out a notice of isolationquarantine  a restriction order on the scope of activities these are some legal forms explaining the criminal penalties of failing to quarantine\\n\\nthe fourth booth is the regular immigration booth show your passport scan your index fingers and theyll give you an entry confirmation slip example pichttpsuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommons225rokkisimmigrationentryslipjpg they didnt ask me any questions same as every time ive entered korea i love how some things never change now youve legally entered korea\\n\\ntheyll take you aside to the 5th booth where they sit you down 1 on 1 and ask you a couple questions to make sure you understand what youre getting into like how long will you stay in korea why do you visit korea do you have funds to pay for quarantine theyll register some stuff on their end give you a   quarantine confirmation certificate that shows youre registered for quarantine give you a lanyard to wear and send you off to baggage claim\\n\\nat baggage claim you can freely move around grab your checked luggage i recommend you stop by the bathroom  buy anything you need from the nearby convenience store this is the last chance you can buy snacks before being escorted to quarantine\\n\\nwhen finished walk through the customs booth and drop off your traveler goods declaration form\\n\\nat the arrivals terminal exit they have staff in full ppe checking people one by one they check your quarantine confirmation certificate and your lanyards see that youre designated for facility quarantine and walk you to a quarantine bus if you are eligible for quarantine at home i believe from this point theyll allow you to go home in a private car\\n\\nif you are entering from the usa or europe they will escort you to a testing booth first\\n\\ni waited an hour for the bus to fill up with more passengers then we rode off to a designated quarantine facility the quarantine facility you get is random its based on which bus you happened to get on so your facility experience may be different from mine i ended up going to a hotel in the outskirts of incheon\\n\\nat the hotel they gave everyone the agreement to facility quarantine form which says you agree to quarantine in this facility for 14 nights  pay the 14 million krw accommodation fee here they ask you for your passport and boarding pass dont throw it away so they can record your flight number  seat number they ask for your phone number too then they give you a room key and escort you to the next booth\\n\\nat the next booth they take your temperature they ask if you have any health issues and what medications you are on seemed like if you need any medications theyll help get them for you\\n\\nat the final booth you show your passport  room key and pay the 14m krw accommodation fee they accept payment with cash or credit card\\n\\nthen they escort you to your room and youre done the entire process takes 34 hours\\n\\ninside the room they have everything a normal hotel room has like a shower  toilet  tv they provide some face masks and a thermometer to check your temp 2x per day they also provide new bottles of shampoo conditioner bodywash a box of laundry detergent toothpaste and a toothbrush\\n\\nfood is left outside the door 3x per day the meals are prepackaged and appear to come from a food catering place each day they give you a biohazard bag to put your trash which is collected the next morning\\n\\nyou are told not to exit your room unless there is an emergency and if you feel unwell call the staff and they will take you to a medical center for testing\\n\\nvisitors are not allowed they do accept deliveries from family and delivery places but only for medicines canned food or essential items ordering takeout is not allowed\\n\\nthey also put loudspeakers in every room which they use to announce mealtimes and other announcements like yesterday someone left their room to walk in the hallway and they turned on the loudspeaker to tell him to go back inside  then someone else tried to sneak into another room to see their family member who was quarantined on the same floor and they made an announcement saying youre not allowed to visit other rooms i think they have cameras in the hallways\\n\\nthats mostly it and should give you a good idea of what to expect\\n\\npost in the comments if you have any

travel is ruined', 'selftext': 'im the type of person who has always gotten excited about backpacks packing lists and the idea of traveling the world alone as a 27yearold woman with no partner or kids its a prime time \\n\\nhowever my most recent solo trip and first one traveling to a country where i didnt speak the native language was a disaster\\n\\nearlier this month i traveled to thailand i was meeting with a travel group when i got there but my flights there and back were solo i had it all planned outa layover in zurich a layover in mumbai no checked bags i was extremely prepared\\n\\nthen i got food poisoning at my home base airport and threw up on the entire flight to zurich when i got to zurich i was so weak and dehydrated that i ended up going to their medical center this caused me to miss my flight to mumbai i then rebooked with oman air and that flight was cancelled i had to stay in a hotel room that night\\n\\nat this point i had no control over the situation but i was upset to be missing out on the whole group meeting i hated that id be the one person who was there a few days late the group was around 20 people \\n\\ni was able to get a flight through singapore by the skin of my teeth i thought things were starting to fall into place until i landed in thailand and found out that both phones i had brought were locked and unable to use sims or esims so i had no data my first time in a country where i didnt speak the language and i was alone and had no idea how to get to my hostel or anything i took the first cab i saw which was super overpriced \\n\\nwhen i got to the hostel i realized i had left my new iphone 14 pro in the cab at that point i broke down and sobbed on the floor of the hostels office luckily the cab driver brought it back to me and i was so happy i hugged the cute british guy who had been consoling me whose numberinfo i regrettably did not get\\n\\nthings were looking up right wrong i soon found myself throwing up again feeling weak and weird and begging to go to a hospital as much as i tried to hydrate it just wasnt working so i got taken in an ambulance to a thai hospital which was just an open pavilion building with a small er room and stray dogs sitting around it the language barrier proved incredibly difficult i later learned you can download languages for offline use with google translate but hindsight is 2020 i told the doctor not to give me medicine and just to give me an iv and a blood test i was given a medicine that had a very bad interaction with my antidepressants i told the doctor i was on them and my heart rate went up to 170 bpm they had to wheel me to the critical section of the room and put me on an ekg with an oxygen tube it was traumatizing\\n\\nfinally when i felt better and was discharged it was late at night due to my lack of phone service i had no way to contact a cab to get back to my hostel and the women at the desk had no interest in helping me after begging in tears they finally called me a cab and the cab driver spoke no english so getting back to my hostel was quite difficult \\n\\nonce i did finally get back to my hostel the power went out for a few hours which is never ideal in thailand i only slept a few hours the next morning i was picked up and shuttled to the group i was supposed to meet with from the beginning\\n\\nonce i was with the group things were a little better i did get a sinus infection though which wasnt great i had some good moments but i was just exhausted and wondering if the trip was just a big waste of money on the secondtolast day i rode on the back of a scootie and fell off on a gravel road which left me with big gashes in my knee and hand i took a 1000 baht cab ride back to my hotel which was a bit on the expensive side on the last day i got bad sunburn \\n\\nit didnt end there though i had long layovers in both bangkok and seoul so i was planning on leaving the airports however due to my track record i decided to just spend the eight hours each in the airports walking around and going to souvenir shops i didnt realize that the incheon airport isnt actually the best for roaming around and buying souvenirs and all of the good food places were closed so i didnt have much fun there either \\n\\ni was pretty stupid and booked a return trip with three layovers bkk icn and lax my time at lax wasnt great either but i was in the home stretch i was so happy to finally be on my last plane home then the guy behind me stopped breathing and we had to make an emergency landing in phoenix since the superbowl had just happened there the night before it took us three hours to take off again by the time i got to my home airport i had missed my ride opportunity and had to take a train and uber home and to top it all off when i got home i was locked out\\n\\nafter all of this i lost ten pounds i did not intend to lose i have to see a gastroenterologist and cardiologist as advised by my doctor and my knee is still healing im also crossing my fingers that i get even half of the money back that i lost will nationwide be on my side \\n\\ni fear that whole ordeal has ruined my love of traveling which was such a big part of me even with the issues i had with past trips i still could look past them and enjoy the greater picture this time i dont know if ill be able to recover\\n\\ntldr i had an awful trip to thailand where i was hospitalized twice and had a myriad of other things go wrong and now i wonder if ill ever get over the trauma and be able to travel solo again'}, {'title': 'brave girls  episode 3 what fearless want

a singaporean living in korea ama', 'selftext': 'hi in light of the recent vtl i figured there might be many considering trips to korea but might be hesitant because theyre not sure about how the situation is in seoul rn or how the tourist scene has evolved\\n\\ni moved to korea last year at the very beginning of the pandemic when the first few cases hit daegu i havent been back to sg since lol got vaxxed here too but anyway i hope to give some insight to those who are on the fence\\n\\n1 how are social distancing guidelines in korea right now\\n\\nseoul and the greater metropolitan area gyeonggi province is level 4 other cities busan jeonju jeju are level 3 assuming everyone in your group is fully vaccinated you can have up to 8 people or 10 for level 3 as of oct 15 level 4 also means that all establishments have to close at 10pm but restaurants can continue to do takeawaydelivery mask mandate continues\\n\\n2 are the tourist spots still open\\n\\nmyeongdong has been very badly hit dont bother the shopping streets in ewha and dongdaemun areas that had tourists as their main customer base are pretty quiet but life in other areas is basically quite normal and business is as per usual id say dont worry too much about that  just look for spots that locals go to as for attractions theme parks etc still open just running at less capacity i saw pictures of everland being super full last week \\n\\n3 i wanna travel to jejua different city instead of seoul how do i make that happen with vtl\\n\\nyou have to isolate for a day until your negative test results come back technically if you can make private transport arrangements you can go to whatever city you want after you land and isolate there but of course its going to be challenging going straight to busan or jeju practically impossible with private transport from incheon airport so you should stay a day in seoulsomewhere nearer to incheon first until the next morning then youre free to go\\n\\n4 how does contact tracing happen if i visit a cluster\\n\\nif its a big cluster there will be a public health alert  disaster message thing sent to all phones in the administrative area of that particular establishment to advise you to get tested free and if you visited at the same time you should also be contacted by the local health center to get a mandatory test free theyll get your contact number because before you enter any restaurants  shopping mall etc youll have to sign in like how sg does tt i suppose for locals we use kakaotalk or naver to generate a qr code tied to our local identity but i believe shortterm visitors wont be able to do this because you dont have a resident number so every place will usually have a book for you to manually sign in  if you cant provide a prepaid number i think you can give your kakao id cause ive seen some exchange students do that also discussions are ongoing on how to get tt qr codes to be verified with the korean system i believe vice versa for koreans visiting sg or people like me returning home \\n\\n5 what happens if i catch covid here touchwood\\n\\nyoull be send to a living facility until your symptoms subside the cost should be borne by you but thats what insurance is for so please get the appropriate policy\\n\\n6 why are you in korea and how long have you been there will you stay here long term \\n\\ngoing into my 3rd year soon im doing uni here and i chose to study here because my department is not offered in singapore if i say what it is i might self dox so if you really wanna know pm but its something very specific to korea my plan after grad is to either continue with my masters here or work for 3 years or so then balik kampong \\n\\n7 is life stressful here \\n\\nyes\\n\\n8 is everyone a kpop star or a walking plastic surgery advertisement do you see gong yoo at the train station\\n\\nno\\n\\n9 can you speak fluent korean or is it easy to get by without learning the language here\\nmy topik score is a low level 6 so i would say yes fluent to a certain extent and i take a good portion of uni classes in korean but you can definitely surive without knowing much korean here if in a big city and actually even in the countryside can also la just use papago naver translate\\n\\n\\n\\nok thats about all i can think of for now i would say if you dont mind forking out the test fees and you want a more relaxing holiday go for it obviously things arent completely the same as precovid no more overnight shopping midnight karaoke or midnight street food  at least for level 4 but this is the new normal after all and you can still have fun\\n\\nedit formatting also added some reoccurring questions to the post for those who are considering a move and want some indepth answers on life here especially potential uni students please feel free to ask or dm surprisingly there are not as many singaporeans studying here as there are in say ukus or even the neighbouring japan i would say for undergrad students theres less than 100 of us and the rest are working so i do understand information from a singaporean can be quite hard to find \\n\\nedit 2 wow didnt expect this to blow up so much i guess singaporeans are indeed very curious about travelling and life in korea thanks for entertaining me today it was fun respite from my midterm studying those who pmed me ill get to them too hope

amusement park and our guide had little to tell us about the history and current events at the dmz i think wed have preferred to go to some of the quieter access points where shopping and entertainment werent priority 1 \\n\\nwe ended our night in gangnam in the coex mall for some shopping and peeked inside the starfield library during sundown it wasnt all that busy and the light was beautiful afterwards we tried bar tea scent which had tea based cocktails the drinks were creative but the service fee of 10k per person was quite steep they allow you to bring your own food though and will plate it for you for free \\n\\nsept 16th  chuseok  seoul\\n\\nthe first day of chuseok seemed like a good occasion to dress up in hanbok we went with 3355 hanbok who have a store right next to gyeongbokgung palace everything was clean and they had us dressed up in a matters of minutes  \\n\\nwe made our way to gyeongbokgung palace and enjoyed the changing of the guards at 10 am do note that during chuseok there are no guided tours be aware that the palace is normally closed on mondays and was only open due to chuseok and was instead closed after the holidays\\n\\nafter returning our hanbok we grabbed lunch at jamsil baseball stadium and got tickets for the game the energy was great and im glad we made it a priority to include it in our itinerary there were plenty of seats left btw which was different from the weekend games \\n\\nwe had dinner at damotori h in yongsan they offer a makgeolli tasting and bar food try to reserve ahead because they only have a few tables \\n\\nsept 17th  chuseok  flight to jeju\\n\\nin the morning we took a short 1h flight to jeju city and collected our car due to a delay we had to scratch some of our plans and only went to the prebooked appointment at orteas tea plantation because of the holiday they only offered korean speaking classes but they were kind enough to set an hour aside to let us taste some of their teas and to explain their production process simply put it was amazing their tea is so so good and there were only few people there with us so we were able to drink our tea in peace with a beautiful view of the tea fields \\n\\nafter checking in we went for our first korean bbq and tried black pork and we lucked out with the restaurant  both our food and server were great and we finally understand the hype about korean bbq you can find the restaurant by searching for   it was close to our hotel minitel soul which was the best place we stayed at so far they offer free laundry service which was so nice and useful \\n\\nsept 18th  chuseok  olle trail 7\\n\\nit was a extremely hot day so we chose to cancel our hallasan reservation and stay close to the sea we hiked along olle trail 7 the first half from seogwipo was lovely  lots of shade and great view points after we passed beophwan port though shade came hard to come by and we chose to hop on a bus and spent the rest of the day at jungmun saekdal beach there were lots of surfers there that day but otherwise it was a very quiet and clean beach with not a lot of people around \\n\\nsept 19th  eastern part\\n\\nmy husband had wanted to do a dive though they canceled because of bad weather forecast i wanted to dive with a haenyeo instead because im fascinated by them there are many different options to dive with them but most require you to pay for two persons if youre alone theres a village in hado though that accept also single persons you can find it on google if you search for experience primer fishing village   reservations need to be made via phone 82 1026853810 but the visit jeju helpline offered to call them for me so it wasnt an issue the experience cost 40000 won my husband was able to spontaneously tag along and due to the high waves we only dove close to the beach because of it they had us pay only half of the agreed price \\n\\nthe haenyeo was very sweet and showed us how to dive for seafood i dont think it surprises anyone that she was the one who caught almost everything while we still struggled with reaching the bottom of the sea it really was inspiring to see and experience by ourselves due note that no one spoke english so we were lucky that we had another group dive with us who were kind enough to translate \\n\\nthe haenyeo museum was closed because it was the first day after the holidays which was a bummer we instead hiked to the top of seongsan ilchulbong the round trip took us about an hour and had the best views weve had on our trip so far the clouds were rolling in then though and we just made it back a few minutes before heavy rain started we quickly made our way back to seogwipo and had an early dinner in the olle market \\n\\nthis concluded the first half of our trip '},

list the context in bullet format hoping it makes it easier to understand\\n\\n 13 years tis i got really sick during travel in the middle of pcsing bases\\n i had a 12 hour layover in incheon so i figured id go to osan and get the ibuprofen treament i ended up getting admitted to in patient care for 5 days ivs supplemental oxygen antibotics the whole shebang\\n my medical condition was a splenic infarction caused by my sickle cell trait this happened because of being in an environment with less atmospheric oxygen exposure this was news to me because i was told by medical professionals that sct was a benignasymptomatic condition when joining back in 06 before sct required red tags \\n i arrive at my new base in process and do two tdys to colorado springs around 5000 ft elevation without any issues\\n 6 months after getting to my new base i am placed in a medical evaluation board  through a combination of covid madness and constant changed of personnel at the peblo office my case was lost in limbo for about 4 12 years i went through two commanders basically on a medical coding that didnt allow me to deploy or tdy not too big of a deal because my unit is deployedinplace\\n my most recent commander takes over and notices my lengthy duration of my board and corrects the med group to have them get their shit together this was the proper thing to do but it was definitely a double edged sword that didnt play out in my favor i restarted my med board process again\\n 17 years tis  i go through the ipeb informal physical eval board  process in about 10 months the decision comes out  medically unfit to continue service dod rating 10 definitely a sucker punch\\n i get in contact with odc office of disability counsel we start the appeal process to get a fpeb formal board this takes about 12 months then the decision came down  medically unfit their reasoning for medically unfit was that i pose unnecessary  medical risk for the air force despite being perfectly healthy for the last 5 years\\n at this point im right at 18 years but things like sanctuary do not protect an individual against separation on medical grounds to say this was a blow would be an understatement the option to retire is right around the corner and im about to be booted with a invol separation payout which is laughable compared to the lifelong pension \\n i get back in contact with my attorney we start the process to appeal at the secretary of the air force level he was very upfront in letting me know that this was a long shot we were not counting on it to go in my favor we only did it to take up more time i planned to apply for las limited assignment status which is pretty much conditional retention til 20 years for people that can still do their job the longer i was in service and healthy the better my las application wouldve been \\n i get called by my peblo office today so i roll in and they told news that i still have a hard time believing saf pc overturned the ipeb and fpeb ruling  fit and returned to duty despite my condition to be honest i still find it hard to come to terms with it i feel that ashton kutcher is going to pop out of the corner tell me ive been punkd and hand me my medical separation orders \\n\\nits been a whirlwind of feelings this afternoon im not one to get emotional but i tell you its like i just been pardoned off death row or something gratitude is all i have for my friends and family giving their support as well as my unit leadership i had their witness statements and all of them backed me for retention my medical provider also gave her statement supporting the claim that i do not pose a risk to myself or other airmen ill call my attorney first thing in the morning to thank him he kept it 100 with me and im thankful he was in my corner im also thankful for big af looking out for the little guy i honestly didnt expect them to give a rats ass about some sgt snuffy when the medical board of the air force was ready to toss me to the gutters   \\n\\n\\nim glad i can now joke about this as a chapter that has passed \\n\\n  \\nsome things of note i talked about the double edged sword of the commander fixing my limbo state she did her job as a commander to enforce timely and proper processing of folks going into a medical board but if it was up to me i wouldve asked her to let them leave me in limbo for a few more years  \\n\\n\\nit was probably that same limbo that was my saving grace it gave me the time to establish that im not a health risk and can continue to serve  \\n\\n\\ngoing through a meb is not a definite end to all those trying to stay in and im proof of that but make sure you are investing in yourself throughout your career be it 4 year or 20 if life happens and youre

'earlier this year i got to spend a few weeks in and around seoul and traveled a little in jeju and busan for the first time this was also my first time out of my home country only knowing the names of a few dishes and very basic korean words hello thank you etc so i caused myself a lot of embarrassment d here are tips many of which came from this subreddit that helped me  \\n\\napps\\n\\nhttpspreviewredditwj19scxbdnld1pngwidth721formatpngautowebpsadfe2b566fe8a6dfb769b48054b721f2c6a0ca20\\n\\n i would recommend downloading these apps picture above \\n\\n i used papago a lot to translate menu items coin laundry instructions etc \\n we used kakao t to order taxis 99 of our taxis were prepaid to go from point a to point b so we didnt have to worry about being upcharged or explain directions that much \\n wowpass had 2 purposes its a korean debit card and has a pass for subways and buses however they both need funds added to them i believe they are also loaded up differently \\n    to add funds that will be used as a debit card there are a few machines to load it up incheon airport theres one near the arex some international hotels big transit stations i believe you can also transfer the funds back into your original account when youre traveling back\\n    to add funds for your public transit pass i usually did it two ways  \\n\\n       theres a list of convenience stores on the app that you can load it up at just ask the cashier to load your tmoney and show them your card and give them how many won you want loaded in it \\n       at some subway stations theres a few kiosks where you can load tmoney up i used my won bills to pay for it as well\\n naver and kakao maps were absolutely essential for navigating especially when youre on foot or tracking on public transit it will tell you which subway line or bus to take and what stationstop to leave on the maps the highly rated places like at least 4345 stars are helpful to find good spots for food and like i used google maps mostly to find places that are more foreigner friendly as in there were positive english reviews of the place especially when i went to get my hair done the salon owner was fluent in english \\n i used kakao bus mostly to check when and what buses were coming to a particular bus stop but usually there is a sign to indicate this \\n\\nmoney\\n\\n keep won bills on you especially if you are going to the street markets and get food or items many vendors have their prices listed and usually only accept cash so having some small bills 1000 and 5000 won were necessary  \\n\\n if you have your debt card you can go to international atms theyre at airports and usually in the walkin area of international banks around seoul there you can get korean won but i had a cap per day of the amount able to be withdrawn and there was a small exchange fee \\n\\n you dont have to tip ie stores or most services \\n\\n if you are spending money at stores go to duty free carry your passport and keep your receipts certain stores offer tax refunds but you need your passport they can be processed once youre back at the airport there were some kiosks to put in your receipts then you take the slip it dispenses to the tax refund desk \\n\\ntransport\\n\\n if possible avoid peak traffic hours on the subway in the morning when people are going to and leaving from work it was unavoidable a couple of times for my travel but over time i wasnt as anxious in a crammed subway car and could mostly freely stand without stumbling not much shoving or body contact despite it everyone mostly keeps to themselves \\n\\n when someone gets off and leaves their open seat in front of you sit quickly lol i had someone immediately squeeze past in front of me to take a seat   \\n\\n when waiting for a bus especially if its crowded have your transport card in hand ready to scan and that you are in line ready to board it once that bus is pulling in at the stop definitely missed a few buses because i didnt have my card ready lol when you are leaving the bus theres a side entrance that opens for the departing passengers while the front door is reserved for the onboarding passengers like boarding you scan your transport card as you exit\\n\\n if you happen to go to gamcheon village beautiful place in busan in those smaller green i think buses prepare yourself for a rocky ride if you dont have seat xd \\n also buses are on time sensitive routes they will most likely start driving as soon as the last person boarding pays so brace a little while you are finding a place to sitstand\\n there are little red buttons to press when youre approaching a stop most of the time there was someone else pressing the stop i wanted to get off at but be aware to not miss it\\n\\nhttpspreviewredditkho48rwrjnld1pngwidth828formatpngautowebps2f2fe7f785034ba6b8f0e87c75c4b701dbdbb05f\\n\\n above is a screenshot of the subway app \\n\\nsubway lines were personally confusing for me but they are very efficient convenient and wellmaintained to go around seoul they are color coded and have two lines going in two different directions there are signs with english translations on which station the stop is heading towards next also on the subway car it has a voiceover and a sign that will announce in english the upcoming station like buses subways are not going to have delays really so i tried to get to the platform before they arrived  \\n\\n there are some restrooms and shops from clothing to convenience and other miscellaneous items in the subway\\n\\netiquette \\n\\n you dont have to hold the doors for other people or be overly friendly in general as long as you are not too loud in public and on transit people tend not to notice \\n\\n everyone follows the street lights to cross intersections and streets \\n\\n do not order togo or carryout and sit downloiter in the store if you want to sit down please say youre eatingdrinking in the store when an employee asks most of the time for togo orders the staff have to give you portable containers for your items rather than glasses or dishes reserved for sitdown customers\\n\\n some sit down cafes will have a return station it could just have a counter or rack to put the finished tray and items on andor have a small disposal area for certain items youve eaten\\n\\n this may seem obvious but do not pick up pose and take pictures with fruitsitems you havent purchased from small vendors i saw a group of tourists do this to a man in jeju and he was not amused to say the least    \\n\\n sometimes people will stare especially older folks however because i pass as korean it did not affect me much on public transit its not very loud and i saw most people stare at their phone or the floor in front of them  \\n\\nlanguage \\n\\n definitely learn how to say basic korean words like please thank you sorry excuse me this and numbers up to like 5 probably you will need to use them like when ordering food or purchasing items \\n\\n maybe not as necessary but if you like certain drinks or food i would learn how to say them in korean  \\n\\ntime\\n\\n there are certain days off and holidays just be mindful when you are planning to go out for the day that the place you are going to isnt closed\\n\\n breakfast may be tricky since a lot of places are not open until 10001100 am but if you are need a snack drink or random things the convenience stores in korea are the best \\n\\nfoods\\n\\n delivery apps like coupang is great for trying out different foods without any pressure to order but i believe you need a korean number to order \\n\\n gwangjang market and similar markets where multiple vendors sell the same type of thing in my opinion do not have the best korean foods however theyre were not bad there are better food vendors at these markets other markets you kind of have to find them though usually therell be a line of koreans lol\\n\\nother\\n\\n there are bidets on some toilets and a few places dont like to flush toilet paper down because of weak water pressure and a have bin for its disposal so prepare to use a bidet lol\\n\\n there are a lot of stairs if you are using the subway frequently keep to the right side unless you are in a rush\\n\\n clothing stores generally dont have bigger sizes but i went to the main flagship romistory store which carried kind of basic feminine clothing that is more korean style i went there twice and wish i could go back lol \\n\\n if you love korean makeup skincare etc oh my god there are so many oliveyoungs in seoul im talking two on one street or across from each other it is much cheaper buying in korea than global sites and they have sales and promotions on usually on offer   \\n\\n'},

allow large luggage', 'selftext': 'psa for anyone travelling to korea soon i was travelling there last week in seoul and busan i just brought a backpack and a carryon suitcase capacity 10kg as i have been living in japan and packed light however my friend was meeting me in seoul from the uk and naturally used up her allowance of a 23kg suitcase and a backpack \\n\\nfor the first few days we stayed at an airport hotel as we were attending a concert in incheon so subways werent an option the first bus we tried to board would not let us on saying they dont allow suitcases on we were super confused because this bus picked us up from the airport surely most passengers have suitcases beyond a 10kg after a few more attempts we eventually found a bus driver that reluctantly let us on it seemed they didnt have an issue with my luggage but just my friends the suitcase did not take up the aisles or anything so we assumed the first few bus drivers were just being rude\\n\\nhowever once we were travelling in busan the same thing happened again this was a situation where we couldnt take the subway every single bus driver refused to take us despite the buses being fairly empty so there was plenty of room for us to stand with her suitcase i want to reiterate how not big her suitcase was it was a regular suitcase another thing that struck me as strange was that last september i had travelled to busan with my boyfriend who is an asian man and he had the same size suitcase as my friend and we got no trouble i started to wonder if we were being refused because were two young foreign girls i searched online for any information about this but couldnt find anything about a luggage rule on buses\\n\\nhowever eventually i spotted a sign regarding luggage and translated it apparently the rule which came into effect on 1st january 2024 does not allow luggage over 20kg on buses be aware of this if youre travelling to south korea soon make sure your destination is accessible some other way like by subway or ensure your accommodation isnt too remote or just pack as light as you can it was a real pain and really frustrating'}, {'title': 'is this seoul tour

incredible trip to south korea with my wife and our 6yearold daughter and we had a fantastic time i wanted to share our experience and offer a few tips that might help others for a similar trip   \\ni wont go into detail about every place we visited but feel free to ask if you have any questions  \\nour itinerary included 4 nights in seoul 2 nights in gyeongju and 2 nights in busan we then returned to seoul for one last night before flying back to france  \\n\\n\\nbefore departure  \\ni did some reading and research about korea through books and online i also posted on reddit several things at first and received great advices i booked a few things in advance flights and accommodations via bookingcom well ahead of time for train travel between cities i used\\xa0letskorailcomhttpletskorailcom where you can reserve tickets online starting one month before your travel date we also booked tickets for the\\xa0nanta show\\xa0on their official website httpswwwnantacokrshow and for busans\\xa0beach traincapsule\\xa0httpswwwbluelineparkcomhttpswwwbluelineparkcom which opens reservations on mondays two weeks before your desired date if i recall correctly  \\nfor mobile connectivity i added an international option from my french provider which included 10 gb of 5g data 1 hour of calls and 50 sms for 2999enough to stay connected throughout the trip\\n\\ndont overbooktake it easy and improvise  \\nsouth koreas cities especially seoul and busan are vast and it can take 30 minutes to an hour to get from one area to another we found it helpful to plan loosely by zones if you miss something dont stresshaving options instead of a strict itinerary allowed us to enjoy each moment we were especially glad we booked the ktx train and the blueline park in busan though we wished we had reserved tickets for changdeokgung palaces secret garden which sold out the day we went  \\nalso note that most cultural sites open around 10 am and close by 6 pm and many restaurants close by 9 or 10 pm with locals dining relatively early between 5 and 7 pm\\n\\nessential apps  \\nwe used both google maps and kakao maps google maps wasnt always accurate for routes or walking directions while kakao maps was very reliableonce you get comfortable with hangul to help with translation i used papago which was especially handy for reading menus learning a few korean basics like greetings and simple phrases made interactions easier and was appreciated by locals\\n\\ninteracting with korean people  \\nwe were genuinely surprised by how kind and welcoming the korean people were on our first day still feeling the effects of jet lag we needed directions several times a group of young people out for the evening went out of their way to help us find a restaurant recommended by our hotel even though we couldnt communicate much in english they were incredibly friendly and we had a fun exchangefrance for them was all about kylian mbapp  \\neveryone we encountered was especially friendly toward our 6yearold daughter people would wave at her and some even gave her small gifts or treats like desserts and candy in restaurants and shops they seemed delighted when she said  thank you or   goodbye when we left other children waved at us too we waved back which seemed to make them happy  \\nwe did our best to show kindness in return for instance we offered our seats to elderly people on buses and trains as were used to doing in france and they really appreciated itthough we noticed this wasnt a common practice for everyone in korea\\n\\nfood  \\nwe tried a wide variety of korean foods which were affordable and delicious generally we grabbed breakfast and lunch on the go and enjoyed sitdown dinners seafood was more expensive but the quality was fantastic especially in busan\\n\\nthe trip itself\\n\\nday 1 arrival in incheon  \\nwe arrived at incheon at 5 pm technically a day after leaving due to the time difference we took the arex express train directly to seoul station which was fast and easy i wanted to buy t money cards for public transit at the station but a lot of shops did not provide them we finally found one shop with t money near the arex access on top of the escalators if youre buying a t money card for a child with their passport youll get the discounted rate card over our days there we spent about 40000 won per adult and 15000 won for our child on public transportation free for children in busan navigating the metro and bus lines was straightforward once we got used to it and taxi was also a extra help\\n\\nday 2 seoul  \\njetlagged we slept 12 hours and started our day in the afternoon at the national museum of korea the museum was peaceful and deeply fascinatinga great introduction to korean history and culture from there we took a city bus to gangnam an area we didnt revisit as it was far from where we were staying we arrived by evening and stopped by the seolleung and jeongneung royal tombs before heading to starfield coex mall especially the impressive starfield library\\n\\nday 3 seoul  \\nwe visited bukchon hanok village followed by unhyeongung palace a calm lesstouristy spot that was really enjoyable then we explored changgyeonggung palace though the secret garden was sold out so we opted for the greenhouse and other scenic spots nearby that evening we took a walk near dongdaemun design plaza after exploring city hall and nearby areas\\n\\nday 4 seoul  \\nwe started our day at n seoul tower taking the namsan cable car about a 25minute wait and then heading up to the tower itself it was a clear day and the views were incredibleour daughter loved it later we headed to hongdae for the nanta show also exploring the lively hongdae area\\n\\nday 5 travel to gyeongju  \\nwe scheduled our citytocity train transfers around 11 am or noon to match hotel checkout and checkin times after arriving at gyeongju by train we took a bus from the station into the city center which was straightforward but took a bit of time by sunset we were at the daereungwon tomb complex where we explored one of the tombs with informative displays\\n\\nday 6 gyeongju  \\nwe took a bus to bulguksa temple and seokguram grotto both beautiful and inspiring sites with a peaceful atmosphere in the afternoon we visited gyeongju observatory and spent time enjoying the scenic flower gardens\\n\\nday 7 travel to busan  \\nit was a quick 30minute train ride to busan but we were surprised to find buses wouldnt allow our large luggage we took an affordable kride taxi instead we started at jagalchi market for lunch savoring fresh seafood then wandered around biff street and gamcheon culture village which was full of colorful artistic displays and picturesque streets\\n\\nday 8 busan  \\nwe dedicated this day to exploring busans coastline we booked the blue line beach train from mipo with an allstops option although it rained slightly the scenery was breathtaking we had lunch near cheongsapo close to haywol skywalk based on reddit tips we took a taxi from songjeong station to haedong yonggungsa templea truly unique temple with a special atmosphere afterward we returned to songjeong to take the beach train and then boarded a train capsule for sunset viewing between 430 and 5 pm keep in mind that waits can reach 30 minutes for the train it runs just three times an hour and 1520 minutes for the capsule despite clouds the view was wonderful and the slowmoving capsule was a fun experience for our daughter later we walked by busan x the sky and strolled along haeundae beach\\n\\nday 9 return to seoul  \\nwe returned to seoul for our last night since time was limited we took it easy doing some lastminute shopping and preparing for our departure\\n\\nday 10 departure  \\nwe prebooked our arex train tickets to incheon airport the night before arriving 25 hours before departure was sufficient though checkin and customs took some time families with children under seven get priority\\n\\na week after reflections  \\nafter returning to france a week ago and resuming our usual routine i can feel how much more there is to explore in all the cities we visitedand were eager to see more of korea including its islands still i feel like we got a meaningful glimpse of korean life culture and history reflected both in architecture and the warmth of the people i feel incredibly fortunate to have had such a memorable experience and to have met so many friendly thoughtful people along the way'}, {'title': 'travel  first look seoul

'earlier this year in south korea', 'selftext': ' 5day tour around incheon and seoul south korea earlier this year organized by an accredited travel agency for starters i think its more advisable to follow the travel agency path to simplify the experience significantly with everything already arranged pretty much all that remains to do is pick your daily ootd and hop on the bus or whatever transportation service that the agency arranged everything is seamless and you get to go to a lot of places without the stress of managing your itinerary and schedule\\n\\na downside of opting for travel agency tours however is the pricier travel costs in comparison with diy costs apparently because you pay for convenience another is the very obvious limitations on itinerary and schedule\\n\\nthe fixed itineraries mean youre often rushed with only a set amount of time at each destination i particularly felt this pressure at namiseom island where i wished we could have stayed at least 4 hours to fully explore and get a better feel of the majority if not the entirety of the area\\n\\nthere were coffee shops and other spots i wanted to visit but i guess thats the beauty of limited timeyou only make the most of it and leave room for future explorations\\n\\nlooking forward to returning in 2026 '}, {'title': '7 day trip report from 5 black people in korea', 'selftext':

olive young plenty of foods\\n\\nmyeongdong the vibe at night is immaculate street foods immense skincare things immense if you are torn between hongdae and myeongdong i would say if you like to be closer to the tourist activities like the palace and ddp then i would choose myeongdong it is also feels like it is hallyu culture all in one place street foods kpop skincare on steroids lol it is packed and very lively and busy hongdae feels like to me more edgy trendy has instagrammable places it is very fashion forward and lots of cafes and dessert places\\n\\nmy favorite neighborhood and place that i really liked was the gyeongui line forest parkyeonnam area definitely cute and aesthetic i just love the little cafes and the trees as you go more towards yeonnam it becomes more quieter and quainter so cute\\n\\ntips\\n\\ni am used to google maps and turn by turn but i couldnt for the life of me figure out the walking directions on naver i thought it would be turn by turn but you have to follow the dotted line on the map i got the hang of it at the end\\n\\nnavigating metro and bus wasnt too bad i found the naver app really straightforward with transport on buses and trains the signs and intercoms also speak in english the signs are straightforward tap in and out definitely learn how to say please refill my tmoney please\\n\\npack light because you will buy a lot of stuff i bought a suitcase thanks to reddit at namdaemun most vendors are really tight with negotiating they dont really barter but this guy we bought two medium sized suitcase for 90\\n\\nif youre looking for souvenirs that say korea or seoul on it your best bet is to go to myeongdong station or you can go outside and shop on the street from those vendors i found most of my souvenirs to bring back for family friends at myeongdong station once you get to myeongdong station i believe you will see the signs to direct you to the underground shopping center part i bought many hats and shirts and it wasnt too expensive but it was cheaper too when you went outside the station to the vendors on the street\\n\\nyou definitely feel that pali pali rush culture here people got places to be and they got to get there but people definitely did stop and help us at the subway stations when they saw us struggling lol\\n\\ni downloaded papago which helped for speech google translate was faster with translating pictures of menus things at the grocery stores etc\\n\\nbuy a mini fan it was hot the sun was beaming\\n\\ngs25 and the purple convenience store are your friends\\n\\ni had problems with withdrawing cash with my wells fargo bank from the atms but my friend had a local credit union debit card and she was able to with no problem we both have visa cards i had no issues withdrawing from a woori bank atm\\n\\nmost places take card the only time i really used cash was to buy street food clothes at the market buy my arex ticket and refill my tmoney card\\n\\nif you buy an arex card once you get to your destination and exit the station you put your card in and get your deposit back\\n\\nfor my black travelers\\n\\nwe def stood out because it was not like it was one black person but 5 lol people oftentimes on the metro would talk to us and ask us where we were from\\n\\ngot interviewed by youtubers\\n\\nyoung people mind their business pretty much on their phones the middle ageelderly people would talk to us\\n\\npeople reeeeeally like when you make effort in speaking korean they are some stares moreso from older people but we would say hello to them and they opened up they truly appreciate it there was this lady exercising outside and she literally stopped and turned her head and stared at us we said hello how are you in korean and she was shook she was so happy lol we got a lot of finger hearts and wahhh yeoppo my mom was feeling herself lol\\n\\npeople were helpful especially at the metro people are in a rush\\n\\nkids will either try to say hi to you or be scared of you lol we would say hi to them or wave to them\\n\\nx200b\\n\\n061523arrived at incheon took arex to airbnb in hongdae thought ticket could be bought  with credit card needed cash went to foreign exchange nearby the arex ticket center and exchanged some cash it was 5 us with large luggages the train became crowded and we took quite some space we were at the end of the car but i didnt see luggage storage got to airbnb in hongdae did not look anything like the pictures so we stayed two nights at the holiday inn express hongdae which was nearby hotel was beautiful and super clean right near metro and next to ak mall the biggest plus was the breakfast buffet which was like a lunch buffet soup shrimp croquettes noodles we only stayed two days at the holiday inn express because since we had such a last minute reservation there were no other nights available for booking the price of two nights at that hotel was more than the price of the airbnb for a week went to eat at hongik sutbul galbi i was hyped for the reviews but it was meh the service wasnt that nice and they really were being stingy with kimchi also they were a little cold service wise but it filled us up\\n\\n616 explored hongdae went crazy with the shopping m playground was our fave and the music was fire was a chill day we were pretty jetlagged ate dinner at chicken in the kitchen food was fire chill vibe server gave us a whole bag of yakgwa tasted like a brown sugar fried dough super good\\n\\n617 checked out at the holiday inn we went to the 2d caf it was cute bought tmoney card at gs25 and put 10000 won on it took metro to sindorim was def a different vibe felt super traditional but still modern felt like a homey neighborhood this is where i felt like wow im in korea we just explored sindorim technomart which felt like i was in the 90s saw a wedding there walked around the food court tried korean mcdonalds bulgogi burger was sweet but it was good the meats at korean mcdonalds  taste real i dont know how else to describe it in the states we are eating something synthetic and gummy i know the difference now lol went to the rooftop of the technomart and it is like a park and you get a whole view of the neighborhood and station was incredibly beautiful\\n\\n618went to ddp there was so many shops and like 4 malls next to each other we walked around and then walked to gwangjang market this place was bustlin tried some spicy octopus flavor and seasoning was good but the texture was what got me lol tried some mung bean pancake bindaetteok and that was super crispy hot and wasnt salty bought some canvas bags and shot glasses and trinkets from a store in the market walked from there to namdaemun which many of the stalls were closed there was one just closing and that was where we bought two suitcases paid the guy 90 usd went to myeongdong tried the street foods went a little crazy with the shopping my favorite place there was all mask story that place has what you cannot find at olive young i liked the prices here better and i got a lot of samples bought mad korea shirts and souvenirs at myeongdong station and bought a lot of streetwear from this seller at the myeongdong station underground shopping center i bought these nice oversized stussy and peaceminusone shirts probably replica but looked pretty good went back to sindorim to the emart which was huge and crowded it was like 9pm you would have thought it was morning this was the first time i saw my mom light upat the grocery store she doesnt want to admit it but she was in her element and had a ball there she wanted to go back\\n\\n619 went to gyeongbokgung palace rented hanboks from hanboknam via klook i thought they would have a bigger selection but there were other places around with nicer hanboks the ladies were super nice though rather than booking an appointment i would just recommend and walk around and see what boutique catches your eye and rent right then and there took lots of pictures with other tourists met a lot of people from china and took pictures with other black travelers\\n\\n620mom wanted to go to a spa so today was the first time taking the bus and we took it to paragon spa this was in the mokdong area it was cool to see the different neighborhoods like mullae etc we def stood out in these neighborhoods because there were no tourists lol there were maddd students everywhere you go there was just student looked it up on google and there are a lot of schools in the area duh but also hagwons paragon spa was closed it is for a while so we walked around and ended up joyeontan restaurant for kbbq this was my favorite and best meal in korea i mean the food was bussin i was translating on my phone the menu and the auntie came and was like this is what youre gonna get and she did her thing then the guy came and he finished the business we were stuffed food immaculate seasonings perfection they all were super nice and we took pictures with the guy who cooked our food because he was the star of the night auntie was busy lol\\n\\n621went to the aquafield goyang spa and got a body scrub came out like a brand new person was an enjoyable experience and the spa is immaculate spent the entire day there and relaxed went shopping in the aquafield mall after\\n\\n622 decided since we had way more bags than what we came with it was like 12 bags for 5 people it would be feasible to book private van transportation to the airport cost total was 158\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nx200b'}, {'title': 'which countrys international airport do you

'thanks a lot to everyone who responded to my questions about korea 2 weeks ago i just came back from my trip and i would like to return the favour to the community by listing some hopefully helpful tips  some of them i gathered from other posts here others originating from my very recent experience \\n\\nsorry for typos etc in english this is not my native language\\n\\nedit i edited the post below to add some clarifications following questions in the comment \\n\\n\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nairport trip  trains\\n\\n1 booking a ktw train ticket to go from a city to another railninja and other websites which appear first when searching on google are not the official websites and they charge the tickets with a significantly higher price than the official website official website is letskorailcomhttpsletskorailcom\\n\\nif you struggle opening the website on your computer try switching navigator to chrome firefox andor opera if it still does not work download the app on your phone typing korail its the one with hangeul character and a drawing of ktx train\\n\\nit is also possible to buy or change tickets directly on train stations such as seoul train station\\n\\n2 website to book a seat in a arex train express or allstops train from incheon airport to seoul \\n\\nhttpswwwarexorkrmaindohttpswwwarexorkrmaindo\\n\\n3 direct buses from the center of seoul to incheon i did not know it but there are also buses going from certain areas of seoul such as myeongdong  buses number 6001 and 6015 directly to the incheon airport terminals these are not normal buses but special airport buses in myeongdong there was even an employee waiting at the stop to explain and ask people to prepare their money which are more expensive and look like intercities buses where the driver helps you put the lugagge in the special storage under the seats before going in the bus i used them for the return trip and it was extremely convenient not to have to carry my luggages through subway arex etc note that the price is 17000 wons and must be paid only using cash or tmoney no card also in my bus i was allowed 2 luggages for more luggage i should have paid more \\n\\nx200b\\n\\nmoving around\\n\\n4 googlemaps wont be very helpful generally use navermaps or kakaomaps i preferred navermaps except in the city of gyeongju kakaomaps was more reliable for buses times\\n\\nalso googletranslate will be absolutely necessary someone suggested in the comment that  papago and deepl would be even better \\n\\n5 kakaotaxi was my friend i found that the fares were much more reasonable than calling random taxis in the streets i dont want to make negative general statements but my unlucky experience was that each of the 3 times i called a cab in the streets without using the app the driver asked me to pay a muchhh higher price than what my korean friend usually paid for the same trips and also much higher from the kakaotaxi indicative fares    i suspect that they just applied the night fare even if it was in the middle of the day or something like that upon seeing i was obviously a tourist\\n\\nif like me you cannot register your debit card in the app notably because the app asks you for a korean resident number or other you can pay the driver directly for this you need to select general taxi in the app not the blue taxis etc and then select pay to the driver you will be able to pay by card or in cash the driver directly beware certain card readers in korea dont accept foreign debit cards so i strongly recommend that you carry a sufficient amount of cash with you in case your card does not work\\n\\n6 public transportation is generally good and easy to figure out dont forget to buy a tmoney card and to charge it by putting cash and cash only in the machines which can be found in every subway or train station also dont forget to tap your tmoney on the little machine in the bus when you exit the bus so you tap when you enter the bus and you tap when you leave the bus\\n\\nmoney\\n\\n7 bank in certain countries such as mine france you need to declare to your bank that you are travelling soon its easy just a quick statement filed on the bank app otherwise the bank will suspect a fraud and block your card i forgot to do it and this happened to me   dont do the same mistake\\n\\n8 exchanging currencies very obvious advice but i did not exchange all my money at the airport upon my arrival because there are currencies exchanges spots in the cities which give much better exchange rates \\nedit someone commented that depending on the exchange rates and fees of your foreign bank it may be better to avoid exchanging money at all and instead just use atm to withdraw wons in my case the exchange rate at the exchange bureau was better than the rate used by my bank when withdrawing from the atm 1450 wons for 1 euro at the exchange bureau vs 1428 wons for 1 euro when using the atm on the same day so i guess this depends on your bankcard fees \\n\\nx200b\\n\\ncities and areas\\n\\nthere are of course a countless number of interesting cities in korea but i had to pick 3 only since i stayed only 2 weeks  \\n\\n9 seoul i followed all the recommendations in this sub and split my 8day stay in 2 first part in hongdae and second part in myeongdong first one was a young  1730 yo party and shopping area 2nd one was very commercial and touristic but really close to lots of interesting areas north of seoul both were good options so thanks for the suggestion\\n\\n10 busan my favourite area was nampodong but i stayed in seomyong in order to be very central it was very convenient to go to haeundae beach and to other parts of the city i personally loved busan i stayed 4 days but i would have liked to stay 2 more\\n\\n11 gyeongju for people who like small historical and very cute cities no need to suggest for an area to stay it is small but i would just like to suggest to pick a hanok for accomodation if possible it was great and i really loved gyeongju generally 2 days  1 night is sufficient but another night would have been welcomed for me\\n\\nbetween busan and gyeongju it is better to take a bus 50 min  easy to find the websites using google\\n\\nbetween gyeongju and seoul i recommend going from gyeongju to singyeongju first 15min taxi  approx 30 min bus but beware going in advance just in case  my bus never arrived so i had to call a taxi urgently and then taking a ktx train from singyeongju to seoul see above  letskorail website\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nphone\\n\\n13 it is true that wifi is almost everywhere but i prefer having internet all the time on my phone and since data roaming fees in my french phone were absolutely crazy 13 euros per mo yes mo not go  i ordered a local simcard with unlimited data which i picked at incheon airport when i arrived i used this websitehttpswwwklookcomactivity16469ktolleh4gsimsouthkoreagclidcjwkcajwrpoibhbveiwa473dntkkrdo7hm4c5ptnhnbi0qgbzyimzhht6nsc9wco7sgpnnjxhd0bocuu0qavdbwegclsrcawds but i am sure there are others\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nglobal tax free\\n\\n14 shopping certain shops will have a logo global tax free which means that they will deduct from the price part of the tax if you show your passport or a copy of your passport is sometimes accepted if they dont deduct the tax they will give you a form with a qrcode that you will be able to use at the airport to get a refund in cash\\n\\n15 hotel some hotels also are global tax free so if you are travelling on a tight budget this may be something to look at for example i stayed in solaria hotel in myeongdong in seoul and i got a good cash tax refund apparently \\n the hotel must be part of the global tax free program to be able to issue the tax free form allowing you to get a refund \\n you must book with the hotel directly not using an intermediary such as booking \\n they gave me the form with the qr code and the details of the refund that i needed to get upon the payment of my stay when i checkedin there was an explanatory notice which also indicated some spots downtown where it was possible to obtain a cash refund in order to avoid waiting at the airport but in my case there was absolutely no waiting time at the airport \\n so at the end of my stay i gathered the few receipts and forms which gave me a right to a refund and i scanned them at the machine at the airport after passing the security and before boarding which gave me cash usd or wons no reimbursement directly in my card \\n please check online the conditions because there was a minimum 30000 wons 50000 wons i forgot and a maximum amount \\n\\n\\nothers\\n\\n16 people were generally very nice and polite i received some help in the street without asking also i felt that some koreans appreciated that i tried to use basic words in korean\\n hello annyeong haseyo which i actually pronounced ania seo but  i guess you should not listen to a french person for korean language advice haha\\n thank you  gamsahamnida \\n goodbye annyeong \\n\\n17 wear a sunscreen i was surprised by how high the uv index was even when it was not very hot luckily there are very good spf50 sunscreens sold in korea at good prices \\n\\n18 there can be very polluted days in busan i even received an official text on my phone asking me to go home because of dust and very high pollution this day i also noticed that my throat itched and my nose was blocked most of my time in seoul and it got back to normal after i left the countrylots of korean people were wearing masks outdoors and probably like 95 of them were wearing masks in the subways and trains  not mandatory but very very common \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ni hope this helps '}, {'title': 'i am solo  s18e08  ep 134  20240131', 'selftext': ' reality dating show\\n\\nin search of a marriage

it was the third time for my friend and we both have beginner knowledge in terms of language therefore we didnt encounter a lot of inconvenience\\n\\ngoing around transportation was really great and convenient and was one of the things that i really liked specially since i came from the philippines naver maps also was very helpful as well as kakao taxi app only issue we had  encountered was when we arrived and the arex train already closed therefore we had to take a night bus from incheon to seoul station we arrived at around 1am at the station and there were no taxis and a really long queue waiting for a taxi it was 5 degrees and it was freezing for us who came from a tropical country  good thing i had setup my kakao taxi app beforehand and immediately booked us a taxi\\n\\nfood we visited a lot of famous recommended restaurants and some of them were a hit and miss one of my favorites was a random samgyupsal place that we found in myeongdong who offered unli meat and beef their beef were so good that we visited again a day before our flight back home cafe culture is also pretty big with all the pretty and aesthetic cafes however as a coffee lover i found their coffee at the mid level as for the cost of their food based on my friends travel from prepandemic she said that the cost of their food has gone higher one tip especially if you can read and understand a little bit of korean is to search the restaurant name in the main naver app and check their menu prices and reviews overall i think their prices are reasonable enough\\n\\nattractions and activities theres a lot of things to do in seoul that we werent able to fit everything in our 8day schedule whats best about this is that a lot of their tourist spots are free based on my experience i think seoul is a really great place to shop since you can get almost anything suwon was also really great it has a really laidback and peaceful vibe that we really liked\\n\\npeople surprisingly i didnt experience any kind of discrimination coming from a sea country i dont know if its because we have features that are a bit close to being east asian the number of times locals spoke to us in korean and chinese was appalling haha but we still mostly look filipino what surprised me the most though is that the people who helped us more were unexpectedly the korean elderlies i cant count how many times they helped us without even asking for their help and they always try their best to communicate with us in english our taxi drivers were also really kind\\n\\nweather we came at the week of the cherry blossoms peak which was the perfect kind of spring weather it didnt rain but was very cloudy at times it was also very sunny in some days which made the temp rise it was pretty hot haha lets just say that my skin was so much darker after our trip i also checked the weather in the morning through naver in order to know if i need to dress warmly\\n\\ncons there are only a few things that i disliked about south korea one of which is the air quality my boogers were very dirty and bldy lol another one is their tap water because it dried the hell out of my hair and skin which triggered my eczema their ppali ppali culture since im someone who likes to take their time when traveling for more than a week however this culture helped out a lot in regards to their service their beauty standards you just cant help but feel conscious whenever youre out and about even if you tried your best to look presentable\\n\\noverall our trip was great and was a really amazing experience will i come back definitely maybe as a solo traveler next time'}, {'title': 'i am solo  s18e09  ep 135  20240207', 'selftext': ' reality dating show\\n\\nin search of a marriage partner hyperrealistic dating begins

in hangzhou china for more than 8 years wonderful city thats about as safe as a place can be im married to a local chinese girl weve been together for 8 years and married for 5 years we have two young children as well around november last year i decided i needed to visit the usa because it had been 2 years since my last return and i greatly wanted to see my aging grandpa\\n\\nmy wife and i decided i would take the trip alone and we would travel to usa as a family during the next summer i left and arrived in usa january 19th about one day before the major news started breaking about a novel coronavirus breaking out in wuhan and greater hubei cases were also popping up in other areas around china as well if i remember correctly in hangzhou we had heard rumors as early as late december and throughout january about a mysterious sars like disease but it sounded like rumors so hardly anyone took notice not a big deal right \\n\\ni was stateside a day maybe two and the news just swamped everything else we know the story from there they started locking down everything and more and more crazy news kept pouring out my wife was at my inlaws for the festival time just outside of the city they have a house and thankfully dont live in some tiny apartment in the middle of the city i became more and more concerned but my wife said to stay put in usa dont come back as it isnt safe the lock down got more severe and the case number exploded i was visibly nervous in front of my relatives what kind of husband leaves his family behind during a time like this everyone assured me theyd be ok and at this point there is nothing i could do i contemplated rushing back but my wife said they couldnt travel even if they wanted to staying out was the absolute safest thing they could do\\n\\ndespite the shit news i tried to have a great time with my family my siblings and i went ahead with our planned trip to costa rica which was amazing by the way many people jokingly called me corona boy my brothers neighbor told me to get out of his garage when he learned i was the one living in china i told everyone i dont live in the place that got ravaged but that didnt do much i closely monitored my health regardless and wore a mask anywhere with a crowd during my first two weeks\\n\\ni was supposed to come back to china february the 12th but obviously my return flight was cancelled the airline said the earliest they could return me to china was april 24th but they could route me to a different city if i wanted i agreed to a flight on the 18th of february to seoul south korea because news was scary about tokyo which was my only other option i was able to easily buy a ticket from seoul back to hangzhou with one layover in between i arrived into seoul on the afternoon of february 19th their time and had two nights to rest before my next flight\\n\\nmy timing is ridiculous because the night i arrived the news was starting to light up about possible infections in daegu and the 31st person being found to be infected i took a bus into incheon next to seoul and closer to the major airport i didnt want to go anywhere super populated but didnt want to waste my day in the hotel nearly 99 of everyone was wearing a mask as the worry from the previous day was hitting hard i ate a nice lunch and strolled around for a bit and bought a couple of more masks for my supply i stocked up early into my visit to usa by the way 40 n95 respirators and two boxes of procedure masks among other things after my stroll i got onto the city bus back to the hotel \\n\\nthat evening i didnt eat and just followed the news on my phone i sprayed my clothing from the day with disinfectant my suitcases too the next morning i put on my mask went downstairs for breakfast luckily the hotel was mostly empty but was perturbed because the staff werent wearing masks i took the shuttle to the airport and was off every single person i encountered wore a mask i rubbed my seat and the seat next to me with alcohol wipes when i landed in the first city in china customs was different everyone had to sign a paper declaring their health masks were mandatory and each individual was checked for their temperature and screened for any symptoms the rest of customs was easy picked up my bags and went back into the airport to check in for my next flight my temperature was checked before i got my boarding pass and again before going through security and once again before boarding the plane several hours later i arrived in hangzhou before 10 oclock and was told i would need to apply for a local health code the code keeps track of where youve been and what time if it is green youre free to move around and use local services like taxis supermarkets even return to your community if it is yellow you must quarantine for 7 days and red means quarantine for 14 days my code was green but i planned on self quarantining for at least a week before seeing my wife and kids\\n\\ntoday was day 7 no symptoms yet i think except for some reflux probably due to travel anxiety and stress ive gone outside very minimally just to buy food and water  ive had a bit of a tickle in my throat but its probably nothing other than my head messing with me at least i hope thats the case about an hour ago a guy called me up and said he works for the local government and wanted to clarify some things he came to my apartment and verified that i returned 7 days ago that i flew from usa to korea and then here i said yes sir he asked me if i was alone in the apartment and i confirmed and said my wife and kids are at the inlaws and that i am doing a self quarantine he asked me very politely to continue the self quarantine for the full 14 days he then said that i shouldnt go outside at all if i needed to get food or water or what have you that i can contact him at any time and he will have someone bring it to my door he gave me his wechat number his phone number and the number to the community office he asked me to contact him if i needed anything even just someone to talk to\\nhe told me that if i begin to feel any symptoms at all that i please contact him immediately and he would arrange a ride to the nearest hospital for the coronavirus by the way here in hangzhou they have basically designated two hospitals to handle the virus all cases go to either one of them  he informed me that it is best to begin treatment as soon as possible he assured me that i am probably in one of the best equipped citys in the world for handling this virus and to not worry hangzhou china is a very developed and modern city by the way \\n\\nmy anxiety has been through the roof lately all the news and my own worries has been stressful to say the least but that visit just now has truly put me more at ease they are so well prepared here and definitely dont want another wuhan to happen i hope that everyone reading this can be prepared and take caution but also dont let the stress take over too much cheers and good health to you all'}, {'title': '5d4n itinerary critique and food suggestions', 'selftext': 'hi yall im going to a trip to seoul in octnov and came up

been asked a ton already but the uk has just changed entry restrictions so now everyone needs a negative covid test certificate before entering the country and im panicking a little apparently lateralflow tests and loopmediated isothermal amplification lamp tests as well as pcr tests will be valid i fly back on the 15th so i need to get a test in either seoul or gyeonggi where i currently am before then i havent been able to find many english info sources and my korean isnt great so i was wondering if somebody could direct me to a hospitaltesting centre where i could pay for a pcr test within 72 hours of my flight should i contact the british embassy in seoul i already have to go there on the 12th because i managed to lose my passport'}, {'title': 'i am a singaporean living in korea ama', 'selftext': 'hi in light of the recent vtl i figured there might be many considering trips to korea but might be hesitant because theyre not sure about how the situation is in seoul rn or how the tourist scene has evolved\\n\\ni moved to korea last year at the very beginning of the pandemic when the first few cases hit daegu i havent been back to sg since lol got vaxxed here too but anyway i hope to give some insight to those who are on the fence\\n\\n1 how are social distancing guidelines in korea right now\\n\\nseoul and the greater metropolitan area gyeonggi province is level 4 other cities busan jeonju jeju are level 3 assuming everyone in your group is fully vaccinated you can have up to 8 people or 10 for level 3 as of oct 15 level 4 also means that all establishments have to close at 10pm but restaurants can continue to do takeawaydelivery mask mandate continues\\n\\n2 are the tourist spots still open\\n\\nmyeongdong has been very badly hit dont bother the shopping streets in ewha and dongdaemun areas that had tourists as their main customer base are pretty quiet but life in other areas is basically quite normal and business is as per usual id say dont worry too much about that  just look for spots that locals go to as for attractions theme parks etc still open just running at less capacity i saw pictures of everland being super full last week \\n\\n3 i wanna travel to jejua different city instead of seoul how do i make that happen with vtl\\n\\nyou have to isolate for a day until your negative test results come back technically if you can make private transport arrangements you can go to whatever city you want after you land and isolate there but of course its going to be challenging going straight to busan or jeju practically impossible with private transport from incheon airport so you should stay a day in seoulsomewhere nearer to incheon first until the next morning then youre free to go\\n\\n4 how does contact tracing happen if i visit a cluster\\n\\nif its a big cluster there will be a public health alert  disaster message thing sent to all phones in the administrative area of that particular establishment to advise you to get tested free and if you visited at the same time you should also be contacted by the local health center to get a mandatory test free theyll get your contact number because before you enter any restaurants  shopping mall etc youll have to sign in like how sg does tt i suppose for locals we use kakaotalk or naver to generate a qr code tied to our local identity but i believe shortterm visitors wont be able to do this because you dont have a resident number so every place will usually have a book for you to manually sign in  if you cant provide a prepaid number i think you can give your kakao id cause ive seen some exchange students do that also discussions are ongoing on how to get tt qr codes to be verified with the korean system i believe vice versa for koreans visiting sg or people like me returning home \\n\\n5 what happens if i catch covid here touchwood\\n\\nyoull be send to a living facility until your symptoms subside the cost should be borne by you but thats what insurance is for so please get the appropriate policy\\n\\n6 why are you in korea and how long have you been there will you stay here long term \\n\\ngoing into my 3rd year soon im doing uni here and i chose to study here because my department is not offered in singapore if i say what it is i might self dox so if you really wanna know pm but its something very specific to korea my plan after grad is to either continue with my masters here or work for 3 years or so then balik kampong \\n\\n7 is life stressful here \\n\\nyes\\n\\n8 is everyone a kpop star or a walking plastic surgery advertisement do you see gong yoo at the train station\\n\\nno\\n\\n9 can you speak fluent korean or is it easy to get by without learning the language here\\nmy topik score is a low level 6 so i would say yes fluent to a certain extent and i take a good portion of uni classes in korean but you can definitely surive without knowing much korean here if in a big city and actually even in the countryside can also la just use papago naver translate\\n\\n\\n\\nok thats about all i can think of for now i would say if you dont mind forking out the test fees and you want a more relaxing holiday go for it obviously things arent completely the same as precovid no more overnight shopping midnight karaoke or midnight street food  at least for level 4 but this is the new normal after all and you can still have fun\\n\\nedit formatting also added some reoccurring questions to the post for those who are considering a move and want some indepth answers on life here especially potential uni students please feel free to ask or dm surprisingly there are not as many singaporeans studying here as there are in say ukus or even the neighbouring japan i would say for undergrad students theres less than 100 of us and the rest are working so i do understand information from a singaporean can be quite hard to find \\n\\nedit 2 wow didnt expect this to blow up so much i guess singaporeans are indeed very curious about travelling and life in korea thanks for entertaining me today it was fun respite from my midterm studying those who pmed me ill get to them too hope to see many of yall on the streets of seoul soon '}, {'title': 'i am solo  s16e06  ep 112  20230830', 'selftext': ' reality dating show\\n\\nin search of a marriage partner hyperrealistic dating begins where singles gather

here\\n\\nyoutube seemed like too much work so ive turned to reddit to share my experience as an epik teacher in south korea i really wanted to put something out there for anyone thinking about doing epik or any teachers preparing for their big move to south korea so here goes\\xa0\\n\\nfirst off i do not have a teaching degree nor any previous teaching experience before epik i am in my late twenties did not have anything back home tying me down so thought it was the right time in my life to do something like this as i was ready for a new adventure i also didnt really have any expectations or truly know what i was doing i was just at a point in my life where i wantedneeded to do something different and thought this seemed like a fun and crazy experience that would be one i could talk about in years to come i like to think that my age lifestyle and years worked in the corporate world benefited me in the sense of my maturity adaptability ill touch on this later and longing for a new adventure  so i knew i was ready for this despite the littletono information that i really had on the whole epik thing\\xa0\\n\\ni wont spend too much time on the whole applicationpaperwork process as there is definitely ample youtube videosthreads on all this  for me i actually did find the process rather straightforward as compared to some countries i didnt have any major backlogsdelays and i only have to go to the one place as opposed to certain state offices us citizens have to work around things just seemed to worked out really well for me at the time too when i had to get my visa processed the consulate ended up being in my town that week so i didnt have to make a 6 hour return drive to do that so you could say it was fate that was helping me get to south korea\\n\\nokay so fast forward to dday leaving my home to fly to south korea  i was really more excited to travel more than anything else i didnt really click that i was moving for work it more felt like a holiday at this point especially because i had a oneweek orientation to get through first before actually starting my job personally i flew in 2 days before we had to meet epik at the airport monday just because thats when i got the best deal for a flight  in hindsight i would have reconsidered the flight that arrived later in the day on the monday so i would have saved on 2 nights accommodation cost as the whole of monday was a right off anyway we didnt actually end up doing anything orientation wise so if you want to save on money ill touch on this later i would fly in on the monday ideally landing before 34pm so you can still get an epik bus to the orientation venue\\xa0\\n\\norientation really just felt like a school camp except you dont know anyone its fucking hot and humid and you are making lots of small talk to figure out whos cool and whos a bit strange personally i really enjoyed orientation apart from the boring lectures that really were not helpful at all i am a pretty outgoing person so i enjoyed meeting and talking to new people and again i still hadnt computed that i was going to be working in a weeks time so i guess it felt like i was on holiday mode however i have talked to people since and they said they hated orientation i think that might be due to the fact that theyre either introverted so meeting so many new people was overwhelming or they were missing home or other reasons im not aware of but as far as im concerned youve already committed to this job on the other side of the world where everybody knows no one were all in the same boat so you need to make the most of it  thats where i was at anyway i thought i found a nice friend group from orientation ill touch on this later so that was really nice to have a little group chat going once we were all separated that we could compare our housesschoolsstudentsetc as we all got settled\\xa0\\n\\nps the demo lessons are not even scary  im not a qualified teacher and it was fine  \\npps you definitely get a glimpse to the fact that they really let anyone into the epik programme\\xa0\\n\\nokay this is where things get interesting for me  the final evening at orientation is where everyones anxiety levels max and some also shed tears  the evening where you receive your school placement which in turn tells you the citytown where you will be living for context i had put my placement preference as seoul but got gyeonggi so if you are familiar with epik you know that before you fly to korea you are only told the region you will be placed in not your city or town so i knew id be in gyeonggi however gyeonggi is huge so i really could have been placed anywhere  delulu me i was hoping for a suwon or seongnam placement a city but still close enough to seoul when i got the paper that had my school name on it i immediately googled the name of the school and pyeongtaek came up  the most southern city in gyeonggi furthest away from seoul  lol at this point i was just glad to have more information although thats all i knew at this point didnt know where i would be living or what my school was like so after googling pyeongtaek enough times i came to terms that its a city and has enough things going on that it would be okay and a big thing for me  it was easy to get to seoul i had also made friends with another girl that was also placed in pyeongtaek and for those that dont know pyeongtaek is big but fate if you will had it that we were place 30 minutes away from each other i wasnt upset like some people were i heard there were lots of tears etc but again i have to say youve come this far you knew what you were getting into when you heard a million times that epiks whole system is not telling you details till the last minute so really all you can do is accept it and embrace the new opportunity\\n\\nokay come the day we had to wake up early to be bused off to our new lives for the next year once again i still felt like i was on some sort of retreat not mentally prepared i was going to be working the next day so you get off the bus and wave a quick goodbye to the other epik teachers you barely know but fully understand and then epik essentially wash their hands of you as they hurry you off in your taxi at this point you dont actually know where youre going  it could be straight to your school or your apartment after an hour or so drive in the paid for taxi i was really humbled as we slowed down when we pulled off a main road into what i can describe as a very small derelict village granted i have come to appreciate the village but at the time i was thinking no this isnt the streets of seoul with high rises and bustling streets that i had imagined and seen all over youtube we then arrived at a small villa apartment my first thought was oh god if im on the top fourth floor i hope there is an elevator for my 3 suitcases spoiler alert i was on the ground floor nb pack light  i regret bringing 3 suitcases anyway my coteacher eventually arrived and showed me my apartment it was actually great no qualms here not super modern but good size for 1 person and everything works fine i did have a typical korean wet room bathroom which i was hoping to have normal western shower but ive since come to love the wet room style me and my coteacher then walked about 10 minutes to the main only road in the village for a coffee and then to school to show me around and meet the principal quickly i was essentially then let off for the day and able to go back home to unpack and settle in its about here that i think anyone else might have started freaking out and considering doing a midnight run  my mind however never went there i think circling back to the fact that i had committed to this i really didnt have anything else to run back to i really did just roll with it and i am so glad i did i did however not have any bedding for the next 3 nights but it was summer and warm enough that it wasnt a big issue\\xa0\\n\\nlike i mentioned the wrong person in this placement certainly would have done a runner im not exaggerating when i say that it is just one road for maybe 150m and then a couple side streets with barley any shopshouses but i have come to love and appreciate the village it is quiet peaceful and i will cherish the year i got to live here granted i did not spend a whole lot of time here as most of my weekendsvacation i spent exploring korea or staying with friends in seoul\\n\\nthe friend group i made in orientation is not necessarily the same one i am close friends with now  i think orientation sort of covers everything with rose tinted glasses and everyone is putting on their best face spending weekends even overnight trips with these friends outside of orientation you really get to know people and sometimes you realise that theyre not your people and youre probably not theirs either  and that is totally fine you dont have to be friends with everyone especially if they dont make you feel good after spending time with them  thats on being a mature adult i did however make amazing best friends also from my epik intake that have made my first year in korea amazing i have spent my time and money well on weekends and days off exploring and seeing all that i can\\n\\non the topic of money  as you may have hear the epik pay is shite and definitely not sustainable the last week before pay day is a real struggle and i hate it but i definitely dont have any regrets on how i spend my money  on exploring activities and travelling  as opposed to staying home on weekends to try save money  thats not how i want to spend my limited time in korea one thing i do regret is not having a little safety net of money tucked away i did but that got eaten up fast in the first couple of months youre not in this job for the money so you need to prepare for that\\n\\nin terms of my school placements  i had two schools  my main school an elementary school with about 50 students and my second school a middle school with about 60 students being a rural placement you are highly likely to get more than one school i actually really enjoyed both of my schools i never had any issues with coteachers or students and my schedule worked out so good like so good like only 3 hours at school on monday and then home lol shhh dont tell epik\\n\\nif you are a new epik teacher what i really hope that you get out of reading this is that if you are placed in a village a small town you didnt hope for or if your coteachersstudents are being nice right now please just stick it out it will get better and really you can make the best out of any situation you are in it might not be easy right now but just be strong and positive if i can do a year in the village you can do anything\\n\\nnow as much as i can talk up the village i couldnt do another year placed here im a city girl and seoul is where i need to be so yes i am moving to seoul with epik for another year i know that my school will not be as easy as i had it in the village ill be doing more work maybe my coteachers wont be as easy to deal with but i am mentally ready and so excited for my next adventure\\n\\ni really did try to touch on a bit of everything especially from a rural placement perspective  but please if you have any questions let me know i am happy to share\\n\\n'}, {'title': 'i am solo  s16e11  ep 117  20231004',

back home here are some thoughts many of which may go against some of the commonly repeated lines\\n\\nother things to preface employed in education nonteaching roles support admin and then private instruction for many years before coming to korea im old by the standards of the should you be here should you do that job question im also a guy from north america\\n\\n1 the pay isnt that bad im not sure how some folks spend their money but that is a big question for me education pay has been depressed everywhere for the time folks complain about pay not rising in korea it does suck but lifestyle afforded is comparable or better than entry or low level full time jobs in the west more money is always nice but its not the 2000s anymore anywhere if youre maxing  there are better options\\n2 starting pay isnt the ending pay finding a good academy and proving yourself to them is one of the best routes for increasing pay job hopping at the year also increases the pay lots of good places only hire in korea because its cheaper more reliable and in offering higher pay they can\\n3 the blacklist is a mess lots of folks who have never worked in education have an idealized vision of what was going on behind the curtain when they were a kid public private university and even private clubs theyre mostly all a mess at the organization level kids are messy kids create problems organizations that work with kids are full of problems its a constant there is a world of difference between the truth that all jobs suck and this employer will steal from you and work you to death spotting it can be hard\\n4 kindergarten is hard as  to teach know what youre getting yourself into before signing up for that\\n5 if youre fresh from college or younger you need to learn patience and to learn your place in an organization many folks from the west are overeager to give input or try to make improvements at the system level its annoying in the west but it is far more tolerated there than here constant suggestions in korea will make you enemies you dont want to make learn how to choose what actually matters and learn how to bring up suggestions in a cautious way advantage older workers\\n6 learn korean any learning will return massively on the investment\\n7 making friends is hard find a club leave work go places where people do similar things get that ig or kakao from somebody meeting people leads to meeting more people\\n8 dating is easier than making good friends seems like a good thing but it kinda sucks after a while\\n9 the pandemic seems to have really dampened the workdrinking culture im older so it bums me out but i see folks ask about this a lot\\n10 i wouldnt advise somebody fresh out of college or from europe to come over here if youre an e2 qualifying european wanting to travel theres better destinations if youre fresh out of college this is going to be harder than a ft near you\\n11 gyeonggido is a hilariously overrated placement\\n12 unless youre from nyc london or other major dense metropolises the top 25 korean cities by size will seem large to you and have most of the amenities you could want in tandem with number 11 its better to live downtown in a midsized city than to get a random gyeonggido placement thinking youre in seoul\\n13 learn to eat korean food this is both a survival and a budget tip traditional korean food is cheaper and it is often healthy\\n14 the pressure to look good is constant and it will break you down over time better to be ready for it if youre coming here start getting into shape it sucks but itll vastly improve your quality of life\\n15 other teacherforeigners probably dont want to know you this seems more true for guys than girls\\n16 epik v hagwon is such an oversimplified discussion luck matters more than your choices for a first job here that said the longterm ceiling for epik is a better lifestyle vs hagwon which is  higher pay i wouldnt overthink the choice between the two hagwon will get you here faster if it matters\\n17 learn professional distance and research teaching pedagogy a bit tefl certs are not true preparation for teaching a class any real experience will be helpful behavioral management skills are typically far more important than your knowledge of english or grammar rules\\n18 eating out at the right place can be near the same price as cooking especially for those that dont really know how to cook or shop for groceries\\n19 somehow somewhere you will get screwed over it happens to everyone foreigner and korean in korea learn to take an l\\n\\ntheres a lot of other stuff but thats enough if youre over 30 or 40 with some life experience teaching experience and know how to budget korea is fine if youre leaving an income of over 75k cad or 60k usd definitely dont do that less than that meh youll be okay'}, {'title': 'i am solo  s16e09  ep 115  20230920', 'selftext': ' reality dating show\\n\\nin search of a marriage partner

by chinese and japanese nationalist trolls to claim and justify that korea and koreans are a product of the han dynasty and the chinese my two cents', 'selftext': 'since ive seen quite a few people koreans and non koreans alike bring up the issue of han commanderies up quite often i firstly recommend you to read my posts that ive made a few years back because ive spent quite a fair bit of time debunking and deconstructing not only gija joseons historicity but also on why the han commanderies subsequently cannot be in pyongyang \\n\\nthe whole premise that the han commanderies is located in pyongyang is based off of the belief that gija and his successors resided in pyongyang followed by man wiman and his succesors of which there is almost no archaeological evidence that has been verified even by japanese colonial era archaeologists because it has nothing to do with the korean peninsula to begin with\\n\\nthe geobody known as the korean peninsula believe it or not is first mentioned in the sanguozhi weizhi dongyizhuan from the book of wei one of the texts from the collection of the 24 histories of china in the late 3rd century ce by the historian chen shou prior to that its even doubtful that the han dynasty inhabitants let alone court even knew the existence of the korean peninsula let alone the japanese islands another point to raise is that wa or wae is quite often conflated with japan during the han dynasty period but that too is quite problematic given the fact that in the book of the later han it states that the xianbei chieftain tanshihuai captured wa people to make them catch fish for his tribal confederation and the fact that wa or wae people referred to being to the east of kuaiji commandery hangzhou zhejiang province in southeastern china its only in the book of wei that wae refers to the people residing in kyushu island notably himiko \\n\\nthe han commanderies were in western liaoning and eastern hebei provinces not in pyongan hwanghae hamgyeong gangwon and gyeonggi provinces that has become consensus since the japanese colonial period in the 1910s \\n\\nfirstly when lelang commandery which was allegedly claimed to be in pyongyang since the 15th to 16th century ce by joseon literati like han baek gyeom and later on by jeong yak yong who believed in the historicity of gija coming to the korean peninsula that was the fundamental basis of the invented historical tradition that gave the justification for neo confucian ideology in medieval korea lelang commandery is in fact described in much earlier chinese geography texts most notably the shujing sugyeong from the han dynasty period 206 bce  220 ce to be where the jieshi mountain the eastern end of the great wall and the pae pei river meet at one point \\n\\nli tao yuan a 6th century ce geographer of the northern wei conflated goguryeos pyongyang which was in liaoyang liaoning province with the han commandery of lelang which was why in his shujingzhu sugyeongju he claimed that the pei river flowed in a southwesterly direction into the sea which again was not based on an independent survey of the geography of that area but asking questions and extrapolating based on his brief interview with a goguryeo envoy that visited the northern wei court at the time\\n\\n  \\nif pyongyang is where lelang commandery was well clearly jieshi mountain is supposed to be all over the way in north korea which means qin shi huangdi han wudi cao cao sui yangdi and tang taizong all went up a mountain in northwest korea and left their poetry and writing inscribed on the slopes of the mountains unfortunately for both japanese imperialists and chinese revisionists jieshi mountain is all over way thousands of kilometers to the west in qinhuangdao city to the east of beijing\\n\\nsince about 1987 you begin to see geography texts from the peoples republic of china by a chinese geographer tan qixiang showing the eastern end of the great wall going beyond shanhaiguan pass in qinhuangdao firstly to dandong liaoning province then all the way to mudanjiang heilongjiang province and other times all the way to the south of pyongyang pyongan province this is based on the fact that imanishi ryu and tsuda soukichi claimed that the eastern end of the great wall reached pyongyang or south of that so that it would satisfy the conditions of pyongyang being where lelang commandery is obviously they have found and have not yet validated any remains of the great wall stretching into the korean peninsula so far which is why the chinese great wall claims are bogus\\n\\n  \\nadditionally the pei river according to other earlier han dynasty texts from the 1st century ce such as the shuowen jiezi seolmoon haeja which is said to flow in a southeasterly direction into the sea all the rivers on the western side of the korean peninsula flow either in a westerly direction or southwesterly direction into the yellow sea the only rivers that flow in a southeasterly direction are in the eastern coast of the korean peninsula but unfortunately you find no lelang artefacts or evidence of han dynasty settlements in the eastern part of the korean peninsula more so than the western part thats why the pei river cannot be in pyongan hwanghae gyeonggi let alone even liaoning province the only closest rivers that flow in a southeasterly direction are in hebei province such as the daling river luan river hai river or chaobai river thats why the pei river is not the taedong river or chongchon river as tsuda or imanishi claimed over 100 years ago\\n\\n  \\nthirdly there have been recently translated excerpts of the diaries of sekino tadashi and other japanese officials in the chosen colonial government at the time from the 1910s to 1920s by the inha university gojoseon research institute and it actually talks about them visiting the antiques market in beijing to purchase han dynasty artefacts for the lelang display museum in pyongyang dr moon seong jae who was formerly at inha university gojoseon research institute has done quite an extensive job translating and discussing all these in detail in his 2016 book the han commanderies were in china unfortunately you have some academic at the university of helsinki called andrew miles logie who appears to have conflict of interest with ties to the confucius institute at the university of helsinki trying to argue that anyone who puts forward the argument that the han commanderies were not in the korean peninsula are nationalist pseudohistorians in fact ive never seen him ever deconstruct this evidence despite claiming to diagnose and debunk pseudohistory his phd dissertation as well as his recent publications are unfortunately a bunch of ad hominem and strawman attacks often aimed exclusively against korean heterodox scholarship that never properly grapple with these arguments but try to attack the alleged ethno nationalist character or persona of scholars with opposing views \\n\\n  \\nfourthly jeong in bo who was a historian in colonial era korea during the 1920s to 1940s before disappearing during the korean war refuted japanese claims of having found the jeomjaehyeon stele in the middle of a field in pyongyang and finding hundreds of stamp seals of the governors of various commanderies that were allegedly excavated from lelang tombs the gist of the counterarguments put forward by jeong was that prior to the 4th and 5th centuries ce there were no steles erected but rather inscriptions were etched into the side of mountains such as what qin shi huangdi and han wudi did when they went up mt jieshi in hebei province some 2100 to 2200 years ago the fact that a 1st century bce stele would exist and be found in the middle of a field that was coincidentally found by sekino tadashi is not only suspicious because its an anachronistic find \\n\\nmoreover the reason why jeong cast high doubt on the seals of the governors was not only the sheer number that they found which you dont even find in major cities such as luoyang and xian that were han dynasty capitals as well as satellite cities within the han empire at the time but also because there are anachronistic titles that simply did not exist a good example is that the governor of lelang commandery during the han dynasty was called lelang taishou whereas during the shortlived xin dynasty during wang mangs reign in the 1st century ce lelang was changed to lexian and a taishou governor was called a dayun some of the seals excavated say lelang dayun and lexian taishou which clearly shows that it is a forgery whilst if they only found lelang taishou and lexian dayun exclusively it would hold more credibility \\n\\nits also bizarre that they find very little ban liang or wu zhu cash currency that was used by the qin han cao wei and western jin dynasties in north korea even though a major epicentre of han commerce and settlement was in pyongyang you can find hordes of roman coins in england france spain portugal switzerland romania greece turkey egypt algeria morocco libya israel palestine syria lebanon and elsewhere that were formerly roman empire territories but you hardly find anything of similar quantity in north korea you have to wonder why when you do in guangdong fujian jiangxi anhui hubei hunan jiangsu zhejiang shaanxi shanxi shandong hebei and henan provinces\\n\\nfifthly in 1993 in jinzhou city western liaoning province a farmer found the seal of the lintun commandery easternmost of the four han commanderies governor in a vineyard which was reported to the archaeological teams at liaoning and jilin universities at the time professor bok gi dae at inha university gojoseon research institute was a phd student at the time when he actually visited that place and this appeared in a news report in mbc way back in 1997 he published this finding in a korean archaeological journal but korean historians or archaeologists did not respond to it because they too blindly hold onto the preestablished consensus for the past 100 or so years some people have spent decades building a career based on this japanese colonial archaeologicalhistorical framework that they have too much to lose if they overturn this which is why quite often they attack people who deviate from the status quo \\n\\nsixthly in 2014 they found the tomb of a lelang commandery inhabitant han hyeon do in a district in beijing that was being renovated to build a new set of apartment buildings from the 5th to 6th centuries ce this stirred a lot of controversy both in china and korea because according to the status quo historical narrative the han commandery of lelang was supposedly destroyed in 313 ce by goguryeo during micheon of goguryeos reign this is incorrect micheon of goguryeo never destroyed lelang commandery if you read the samguk sagi or the 24 histories of china in fact lelang commandery was only extinguished in the mid 5th century ce after the northern wei and goguryeo that were in a marriage alliance divided the northern yan state that was ruled by the feng family which happens to be in an area spanning western liaoning and eastern hebei province \\n\\nsubsequently you would have people raise the lelang commandery transfer theory from pyongyang to qinhuangdao which is quite a popular claim that was first coined by imanishi ryu to claim that lelang commandery was in pyongyang from 108 bce to 313 ce before being moved all the way to qinhuangdao when zhang tong a chieftain of the lelang inhabitants took 2000 residents all the way to pyongyang and then defected to the murong xianbei ruled northern yan state in qinhuangdao hebei province where a replacement lelang commandery was established across a span of 2000 to 3000 kilometres mind you even in the 17th century ce when park ji won a joseon era diplomat set out from seoul to beijing it took them 6 months to travel that distance when roads were better developed than 1300 years earlier during the western jin dynasty goguryeo would have surely intercepted zhang tong before he escaped to qinhuangdao from pyongyang if lelang was really in pyongyang but they did not you have to wonder why well the answer is simple because lelang commandery was not in the korean peninsula and the murong xianbei northern yan state never controlled any part of the korean peninsula as we all know these events all happened in hebei province which is why zhang tong and the escape of 2000 inhabitants from lelang which was a border facing region between goguryeo and the northern yan was feasible and without difficulty or being captured\\n\\nits quite ironic but chinese often complain about japanese imperialism but are more than ready to use japanese colonial imperialist historiography when it suits their agenda thats why chinese complaints about japanese imperialism come across as disingenuous in my eyes considering their new revisionist historiography vis a vis korea is not only based on sinocentrism chinese chauvinism but also japanese imperialist historiography'}, {'title': 'jamboree organizers have sent hosts on a wild goose chase asking them to prepare

assigned 56 members of the sudanese delegation  sudan  first yemen then syria and now sudan which is another wartorn region of the greater middle east which includes northeast africa  well sudan does have a scout organization so it could be true that at one point they may have entertained coming to the korean jamboree  but ultimately they never traveled to south korea\\n\\nwell guess what tongwon university did though upon being assigned the nonexistent sudanese delegation the universitys administrators coordinated with civil servants from gwangjus city hall and brought in food safety officials policemen and firemen as anyone from sudan should be handled with tlc given the countrys precarious geopolitical situation  these officials inspected the dorms bathrooms and common areas for safety in particular they swept the areas to ensure there are no hidden cameras or av devices implanted by prior tenants  they also prepared packed lunches for the sudanese and ensured they are completely free of pork  which meant no spam which koreans cant get enough of  the organizers actually had told them that the sudanese may arrive early  so the hosts had their welcome mats out and

competition between korail and srcompany responsible for running srt\\n\\npreviously all trains were managed by korail sr was created with huge government support because korail wasnt pulling enough

people in society from traveling government subsides will keep korail from going out of bushiness but they cannot rely on it forever\\n\\nseeing this korail decided to increase their ktx price instead this opened up whole new problems now some people in the government got thinking\\n\\nso we open a new rail company that exclusively run high speed trains so korail has some competition and theyll

near suseo station experinced a failure making few srt train inoperable bound by an agreement ktx trains pulled into suseo station korean rail community got loads of pictures on that day however this brought the debate on why is korail covering for srs issues and why cant we run both ktx and srt from suseo all the time\\n\\nfew months later sr announced theyll be operating independently from korail korail responded to this by so if youre really independent you know all the trains youve borrowed from us we want them back then sr backed down by saying were making more trains so were using your trains until theyre finished\\n\\nbut what really set the strike going was expansion of srs network srt trains increased their coverage to new lines but remember they only have limited number of trains this raised some eyebrows as that means less srt trains will be running on high demand route and those routes always get sold out 23 days before departure during peak hours sr responded to this saying there will be no change in train schedule\\n\\nin reality they kept the schedule same but slashed the trains in half srt during peak hours run as multi trains meaning two different trains will be joined by couplers so theyll act as one train but have twice the capacity sr basically took out half of their multi trains and run them as single trains and get the remaining trains to the new line\\n\\nimmediately frequent users of trains didnt like what the sr was doing daegu and busan which majority of these trains go to didnt like this either rail union saw this and thought nows the

was in the imperial army for over three decades rising up to become lieutenant colonel in the imperial army by the 1940s and then somehow became lieutenant general in the south korean army and minister of national defense of south korea in 1952 and was eventually buried with honors in the seoul national cemetery\\n\\nit seems baffling and absurd to me that someone who explicitly pledged allegiance to imperial japan and renounced his korean identity could become a highranking government official of the republic of korea and be honored at its national cemetery in the memoir the future south korean minister declares that koreans need to assimilate with the japanese people and become completely like them he describes how he transformed from a pure korean into a fullyfledged yamato person during his decadeslong career in the imperial japanese army the entire memoir reads like a long passionate love letter to imperial japan where his disdain for the korean nation and his korean ancestors is quite palpable so why is he still honored at south koreas national cemetery alongside the graves of korean independence activists\\n\\nthere is one korean news articlehttpsnnewsnavercommnewsarticle4690000409460sid102 that discusses this very issue and one korean journalist posted a youtube videohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgxtp9bg9zo of himself visiting the actual grave of the collaborator at the cemetery expressing his disgust at the situation angry comments on the video call for the grave to be dug up but the video has barely gained any traction online garnering just over four thousand views in four years the korean media seem to be aware of the existence of this memoir in the colonial newspaper but the actual text of the memoir had not been transcribed or translated beyond the headlines until now\\n\\nthe author of the memoir was shin taeyoung  his original korean name or hirayama hoei  his adopted japanese name it was published on the front page of the november 17 1943 evening edition of keijo nippo the national newspaper of colonial korea and a propaganda mouthpiece of the imperial japanese colonial regime that ruled korea from 1905 to 1945 the colonial newspaper dedicated over half of the front page to this memoir indicating the importance the colonial regime attached to it to reach as many korean readers as possible\\n\\nin his memoir hirayama describes how he trained and served as an officer in the imperial japanese army for three decades recounting the hardships he endured to fully assimilate into japanese culture and prove his loyalty to imperial japan he advocates for military training in korean schools to instill japanese spirit and discipline reflecting the views of other ethnic korean imperial army officers like him including south korean dictator park chunghee he saw the japanization of the korean nation as the only way to revitalize it and counteract the perceived cultural and ideological decay among the korean people\\n\\ncan you think of any other instance where a person renounces their ancestral country in writing and through service with a military of a foreign country that tried to erase their ancestral country then later becomes a government official and highranking military official of that same ancestral country and is buried with honors in its national cemetery to me it seems quite paradoxical and unjustifiable\\n\\nnote yamato people refers to ethnic japanese people throughout the memoir there is a second part to this memoir which was published on november 18 1943 in which hirayama mainly goes on to scold korean families for being reluctant to send their sons off to war and severely criticizes the confucian values of korean culture if there is interest

sighed with relief feeling both reassurance and satisfaction yet at the same time i harbored secret worries\\n\\nas an officer of the imperial japanese army reflecting on the situations and experiences i have encountered over thirty years of military life i compare todays circumstances and discover a vast light for the future of the korean peninsula my thirty years of effort and hope crystallized from my blood have not gone in vain now before my eyes they have materialized bringing unparalleled honor and pride to our peninsula will the modern korean youth properly reflect on the past squarely face the present circumstances feel this honor and firmly grasp this light will they eagerly come forward as if to say they have been waiting for this moment and volunteer without exception this is my concern i observed their general behavior with the greatest expectation and interest\\n\\nit was a long time ago in 1908 when i crossed over to japan with great hope and ambition leaving my homeland behind for the first time to study in the imperial army it was right after the russojapanese warhttpsenwikipediaorgwikirussojapanesewar korean politics were extremely chaotic the general level of cultural maturity was very low and the thoughts of the general public were confused and unsettled moreover the atmosphere between japan and korea was genuinely gloomy casting a shadow over koreas future\\n\\nin such an environment my 17 classmates and i along with 26 students from the next batch of students aspired to the imperial army and crossed over east to japan to study at the imperial army cadet school of these comrades ten returned home influenced by the times and the ideological turmoil while the remaining stayed and graduated in the first batch in 1914 during the fifth year of koreas annexationhttpsenwikipediaorgwikijapane28093koreatreatyof1910 our group of 13 and the following years 20 graduates totaled 33 we were assigned to various divisions nationwide as apprentice officers and in december of the same year our group of 13 was commissioned alongside our fellow japanese graduates\\n\\nour treatment in the military was absolutely nondiscriminatory the guidance from our superiors was extremely kind and meticulous our colleagues interacted with us with the utmost sincerity and our subordinates willingly obeyed us from their hearts at that time this treatment of koreans was an extraordinary privilege and an extreme honor however beneath the surface there were many other viewpoints questions lingered such as whether these koreans who had studied in the empire and become officers truly possessed the yamato japanese spirit fully demonstrated it and could risk their lives in actual combat could they train japanese soldiers\\n\\nthe military has many classified matters would they demonstrate the military spirit and faithfully protect these secrets such concerns were deeply latent accordingly we faced many trials depending on the circumstances reflecting quietly on these events it was natural given that japan and korea had only just unified and the general level of cultural maturity was still very low with the thoughts of hte people not yet unified however humans are emotional beings it is normal for them not to consider the natural course of events as natural i too did not voice it but felt much distress and discomfort in my heart given our situation at that time it could be said that it was also natural to feel this way\\n\\n\\n\\nhowever when i began to think calmly i realized that the state korea had fallen into was not our fault this was all the fault of our ancestors nor was it japans fault far from being at fault japan had actually saved korea if japans hand had not reached out korea would have inevitably fallen into the hands of either russia the united states or britain this conclusion led me to discover a causal connection and to firmly consolidate my belief\\n\\nwe were born in korea a corner of east asia with an ancient history and a high culture living as a large unique community as koreans however for many years our nation had been ignorant of the trends of the world becoming superficially ostentatious and weak internally corrupt to the extreme we were destined to be swallowed up by russia the united states or britain sooner or later if that had happened far from being an officer of imperial japan i would now be a slave of those nations if i didnt become their slave it is doubtful whether i could have even survived\\n\\nhow could that have been acceptable japan and korea are of the same civilization and race moreover japan possesses a national polity unrivaled in the world having shaped a history of three thousand years the mission entrusted to the japanese people as human beings is to use their godgiven abilities to the fullest on the stage of east asia contributing to the development of human culture especially the welfare and progress of the east asian peoples as koreans we have been given the new mission of becoming subjects of imperial japan uniting completely with the yamato people focusing on japan to develop protect and nurture east asia to fully fulfill our mission of sweeping away the gloomy atmosphere of today and achieving renewal it is imperative that we assimilate with the yamato people as soon as possible and become completely like them there is no other way this is also the path to our boundless happiness as koreans\\n\\nto achieve this todays koreans must fully embody the spirit of the imperial way possessing the complete japanese spirit and demonstrating the ability to act as imperial people i now having the opportunity to become an officer of the empire recognize my mission is not just to fulfill my responsibilities as an officer but also to shoulder the responsibilities of all koreans\\n\\n\\n\\ni am now being tested at an extraordinary crossroads my every move as an officer of the empire directly reflects the future of all koreans i must be a fullyfledged yamato person and set a splendid example demonstrating that there are koreans who have become yamato and instilling the belief that koreans can also become yamato people my belief is that if i can do this the gloomy atmosphere of today will be swept away and a clear air will prevail\\n\\nfor thirty years i have lived a bloodsoaked life of effort striving to cultivate my character as a yamato person working to complete my given duties and enlightening my fellow koreans especially the younger generation if a japanese person studied for one hour i studied for five or ten hours when i thought the tasks assigned to me were too heavy compared to my abilities i worked tirelessly to complete them forgetting both rest and food for me it was more about the efficient use of time than about talent for more than twenty years i formed a family but i had no time to look after it that has been my life\\n\\neven if i write these things the true hardship and effort involved are unimaginable to anyone but myself who has experienced and carried them out becoming a complete yamato person as a korean is not easy in the summer of 1918 i was promoted to lieutenant three years and eight months after being commissioned as a second lieutenant a month later i received orders for mobilization and was sent to siberiahttpsenwikipediaorgwikisiberianintervention it was my first deployment the time had come to demonstrate my dignity as both an officer of the empire and a korean a soldier must face actual combat to prove his worth it is only after experiencing the baptism of bullets that a persons true value is revealed no matter how much a korean born to ancestors who had drifted into superficiality and decay claims to possess the pure yamato spirit and to be japanese without actual achievements and evidence who would trust them\\n\\nthis onceinalifetime opportunity allowed me to prove that i a koreanborn person could truly grasp the yamato spirit and be pure japanese however i did have personal concerns my father had passed away half a year before my graduation from the military academy leaving only my mother and one younger brother at home since my commission i had only returned home once on leave and i had no idea about the state of my household there were many unresolved matters that only i could handle the number of family issues remaining was considerable\\n\\n\\n\\ni was called by my regimental commander and i went to his office\\n\\nhe told me you are to be deployed soon if there is anything regarding your family or any other matter do not hesitate to tell me after you leave i will handle it if possible so feel free to speak up\\n\\nwhat a deeply compassionate thing to say i was moved to tears from the bottom of my heart however i thought to myself quietly there were things that could only be settled by myself yet i was now departing by imperial command moreover this was the time to prove my japanese identity as a korean now was not the time to be concerned with trivial household matters thinking this i firmly replied there is nothing i will gladly go to yasukuni shrinehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiyasukunishrine i see then im counting on you he said\\n\\n\\n\\ni landed in busan and headed for siberia through manchuria passing through korea felt like a fateful journey i was overwhelmed with various emotions due to the railroad transport arrangements i stayed in busan for two nights without any specific duties at home i had only my elderly mother and a younger brother\\n\\nin the summer of 1915 the year following my commission i was granted a tenday leave to return home since then i had not been back for three years from then on i would only meet my family at yasukuni shrine i wished i could have departed a day earlier to bid them a final farewell i wanted to embrace my mother firmly and if possible nurse like an infant one last time i wanted to look at her face to not forget it this very thought made my heart break such feelings are felt by japanese and koreans alike perhaps japanese people might feel them even more strongly however i thought to myself i am representing koreans in my first expedition\\n\\nif i mentioned that i wanted to leave early people might criticize us koreans by saying that koreans are too attached to their families and fear for their lives i had to be very careful so i said nothing i only sent a letter to my brother asking him to bring our mother to yongsan station when i passed through i spent a night in busan the next day around noon i received a sudden phone call from the station it was from another officer in my company the gist of the call was as follows\\n\\nthe officer asked the battalion commander lieutenant shins my surname at the time was shin family is in seoul since he only has his mother left why not let him leave a day early to see her the battalion commander responded i had never considered that a passenger train is departing soon if he comes to greet me he will miss the departure time so let him skip the customary greeting and have him leave immediately have him meet his family at yongsan station at midnight tomorrow so his orders were that i depart immediately\\n\\n\\n\\nsince this was what i had hoped for i had no reason to hesitate given my superiors permission i left immediately and went to seoul i was able to see my mother for about ten hours with that i felt at ease i felt ready to go to yasukuni shrine at any time\\n\\nat the time even matters that might seem trivial from a human perspective required koreans to make a special determined effort so understandably you can imagine how much hardship koreans must have had to endure to become japanese thirty years ago i went to siberia and fought for two years i am ashamed to say that i did not achieve significant military accomplishments but i did not act cowardly i upheld the spirit of an imperial officer and maintained the dignity of the korean people after two years i returned home the atmosphere within the military became more positive however i could not remain sitting on my laurels given the situation in korea at that time koreans still needed to put in a lot of effort i got married and as children came one after another my perspective on life underwent a significant change\\n\\nalthough the initial destination of my first expedition was yasukuni shrine for better or for worse i returned alive without going there but from then on i felt like i was not truly living i had already died in siberia i was already a skeleton a dead person should not have sensations whether i am twisted or pinched nothing should hurt naturally there should be no sensations of suffering sleepiness or hunger i worked with that kind of mindset of a dead man this was for imperial japan and for korea\\n\\n\\n\\nthough the term internal harmony between japan and korea was popular the path ahead was still long the shadow remained dark there were still grievances and dissatisfaction even in the military aside from the 13 of us and the 20 officers from the next class no successors were produced ten years after my commission part of the military service law was amended allowing for the establishment of a volunteer conscription system for koreans talented students from korea who passed the entrance exams were admitted to military cadet schools officer schools and other military institutions\\n\\nthinking back after six years of studying in the imperial army and ten years of serving my efforts had finally started to bear fruit bringing light to the korean peninsula what a moving moment it was i had always believed that the best way for koreans to become true yamato people and live with unwavering conviction was to join the military\\n\\n\\n\\ni believe it was around 1929 or 1930 before the manchurian incidenthttpsenwikipediaorgwikimukdenincident one day i was called by the regimental commander and went to his office he presented me with a document it asked is it feasible to assign active officers to schools primarily attended by korean students of at least middle school level to implement military training my superior was seeking my opinion on this matter he asked for my frank opinion in writing with no holding back\\n\\nat that time the general mood of the times strongly advocated for harmony between japan and korea the educated korean class earnestly desired the implementation of compulsory education and the early introduction of conscription they submitted petitions to authorities in charge either individually or through representatives and even traveled to the central government to negotiate directly\\n\\nthis enthusiasm from the educated korean class stemmed from a strong desire to transform the entire korean population into imperial subjects as soon as possible sweep away the gloomy atmosphere and realize true japanesekorean unification however given the low level of cultural maturity and numerous ideological considerations in korea at that time the authorities repeatedly deemed the requests too early to implement\\n\\n\\n\\nin this context the issue of implementing military training for korean students arose i responded\\n\\ngiven todays situation achieving true unity between japan and korea requires koreans to become imperial subjects as soon as possible to do this koreans must grasp and embody the japanese spirit as soon as possible the best way to achieve this is to implement conscription as soon as possible to instill the military spirit however it is too early to introduce conscription in korea therefore at least for now it is crucial to assign active officers to schools of at least middle school level to provide military training to instill the japanese spirit and raise a class of leaders if we keep hesitating by saying that the timing is too early when will japanesekorean unity ever be achieved there are already some koreans like me who were not born with the japanese spirit because they were originally born pure korean it is entirely thanks to military education that a previously pure korean like myself has become a japanese today from this perspective the only way to make koreans imperial subjects as soon as possible is to implement military training in schools i urge you to implement military training in schools decisively and without hesitation like cutting through tangled silk with a sharp swordhttpwwwromajidesucomdictionarymeaningofe5bfabe58880e4b9b1e9babbhtml\\n\\nsince the authorities had already established a policy whether my modest opinion had any effect is another matter nonetheless the following year military training was experimentally implemented at gyeonggi high school and pyongyang high school after one year seeing the positive educational effects the training was gradually extended across korea leading to what we now see today\\n\\ntranscription\\n\\n 19431117\\n\\n

korean military', 'selftext': 'there are a multitude of posts on this subreddit and on other forums and websites from overseas koreans ethnic minority korean citizens and others who are obligated to serve mandatory military service unfortunately there are quite a number of wellmeaning but misinformed people who either provide anecdotal information or information based on foreign militaries such as singapore which is a completely different system as well as those who are simply full of shit\\n\\ni have compiled a summary of some of the options available to those who are liable for military service trying to focus on the options most applicable to those with experience living overseas or with limited korean skills i will try add as much as i can please feel free to correct me and ask questions i will also be trying to continue to add to this guide as much as i can\\n\\nofficernco \\n\\nofficers require a bachelors degree from any accredited university can be from outside korea ncos require a high school diploma again can be from outside korea both require you to take an examination which is in korean and they can be quite difficult and require time at a tutorial centre  competition for both officer and nco can be very stiff and they have recruitment periods infrequently for example rok army ocs has one intake per year\\n\\ninterpretation officer\\nthis is a kind of specialised officer who engages in interpretation usually korean to english but also rarely other foreign languages the test to become one is different from that of regular officers and requires extensive time at a hagwon air force interpretation officers are universally considered the best one even is assigned to the president in cheongwadae followed by navy army then marine corps\\n\\nenlisted \\n\\nthe korean military generally follows a method where you can either receive a draft notice  or formally a  or you can choose to serve in one of an extremely wide range of options if you receive a draft notice you will 100 serve in the army but you can ignore the notice and apply for one of the options instead most people nowadays apply for a specific vocation rather than wait for a draft notice which can take several months to arrive\\n\\n\\narmy\\n\\nthe army has the widest options it is impossible to list all of the options and i would encourage you to find someone who is fluent in korean to go through the mma  website and look through the extremely wide range of options i have highlighted a few below\\n\\nservice period is 18 months or at least will be soon enough\\n\\nkatusa\\n\\nthis is a lottery process basically all katusas serve with us army forces korea after finishing rok army basic training competition is quite high about 15 acceptance rate and you can only apply once if you choose to apply have a backup plan \\n\\nspecial forces \\n\\nyou serve in one of the special forces groups where you undergo airborne school then go on to fulfill administrative duties such as office work or perhaps pack parachutes you will not be an operator  who enlist as staff sergeantnco  in a separate process a major benefit is the airborne training parachute as well as a guarantee of where you will be posted to apply you do need a decent level of fitness including pullups but competition is not that high\\n\\ninterpreter \\n\\nyou will have to apply and competition is quite stiff many attend tutorial centreshagwons to prepare for the exams and they require a high level of both korean and the chosen foreign  language english french arabic japanese etc  while some interpreters in the air forcemarines are picked during basic training do not think that just because you are good at english that you will become an interpreter this may have been true in the past but not now\\n\\nnavy\\n\\nit is not difficult to join the navy in general competition is not that high close to 100 acceptance rate for general shipborne duties for example\\n\\ninterpreters\\nyou can also apply as a interpreter\\n\\nspecial forces\\nthese consist of ssu ship salvage unit and udtseals these are two elite units which recruit once a year and ssu especially has crazy high levels of competition\\n\\nservice period is 20 months\\n\\nmarine corps\\n\\nwhile the marine corps are under the navy they recruit separately you cannot apply for both the navy and marine corps at the same time while competition used to be extremely high during the yeonpyeong island bombings period 15 now the acceptance rate is closer to 50 it is much easier if you apply to become a driver or a cook marine corps recon competition ranges from around 5 to 15 depending on the month to apply you need to take an interview so you need a basic understanding of korean and make sure to learn about basic marine corps history its mostly to weed out those who are clearly unfit for the corps as well as pushupssitups\\n\\nservice period is same as army 18 months\\n\\nair force\\n\\nthe air force is considered quite easy by many and therefore quite competitive most air force recruits become military police where you guard the bases\\n\\nservice period is 22 months the longest\\n\\npolice  firefighter \\n\\nthese two are quite similar so i will lump them together\\n\\ncompetition to join police is very difficult with 5 acceptance rate in place such as seoul and gyeonggi province each province has its own different method of selection some use lottery and some interview etc many applicants travel across the country and apply in each province and city the test usually requires you to do at least 20 pushups with perfect form\\n\\nauxiliary police will no longer be recruited from 2023 and firefighters from 2022\\n\\nsocial service agent  or formally \\n\\nyou cannot choose to become one but rather become one by getting the lowest grade 4  in the physical and mental examination you take at the mma  called  or formally  a very small number of people do cheat

which ruled over korea from 1905 to 1945 this article illustrates one example of the manipulation and control tactics which colonial authorities employed on the korean population detailing the story of mr kanemitsu likely originally mr kim a member of the seoul prefectural assembly during the japanese colonial period it portrays his initial decision to run for office only to withdraw his candidacy later the backstory likely involves mr kanemitsu kim committing what the colonial regime viewed as a grave sin running for office without receiving an endorsement from the official nomination system of the colonial regime his candidacy supported by many sympathetic koreans hoping for positive changes likely posed a significant challenge to the colonial authorities\\n\\nmr kanemitsu right standing with his teacher bearded master imaizumi lefthttpspreviewreddit5ncvjz93dlzc1jpgwidth696formatpjpgautowebpse75a7ad13a565eedb26dd794c0d3394a0c613b59\\n\\nmr kanemitsu could have suffered severe repercussions for his grave sin ranging from imprisonment to worse however his popularity and support among the koreans probably led to a negotiated settlement the regime realizing the advantages of coopting rather than crushing him might have offered to drop charges in exchange for his withdrawal from the election and his endorsement in this article calling upon fellow koreans to embrace the teachings of master imaizumi a prominent spiritual leader propagated by the regime to instill loyalty and obedience among the koreans the published story framed his decision to drop out as influenced by a lifechanging encounter with master imaizumi see this earlier posthttpswwwredditcomrkoreacomments105sc9cmasterimaizumiteisukethespiritualleaderof which explores keijo nippos coverage of master imaizumi and his preaching tour through korea in 1942\\n\\nthis article likely aimed not only to discourage similar acts of defiance but also to reinforce the regimes ideological dominance by showcasing mr kim as a model korean who humbly submitted to imperial authority it exemplifies how the regime used media to control the narrative suppress dissent and maintain its power over the korean populace\\n\\nmaster imaizumi teisuke who is depicted as converting mr kim into a loyal imperial subject was a towering figure in the landscape of shinto theology and a pivotal figure in the colonial regimes efforts to justify and solidify their rule over korea as a prominent shinto theologian his lifes work centered around kokugakuhttpsenwikipediaorgwikikokugaku a nativist movement that valorized japans ancient shinto traditions while rejecting foreign influences like christianity buddhism and chinese philosophy\\n\\nby the time of his 12day lecture tour in korea in 1942 imaizumi was an 80yearold man with a flowing white beard embodying the image of an ancient sage his long life had spanned the radical transformation of japan from a feudal society into a formidable empire his rigorous defense of japans ancient customs and shinto roots made him a revered figure with his words often seen as gospel truth by the colonial rulers in korea\\n\\nduring his lectures in korea imaizumi portrayed japanesekorean unification in starkly paternalistic termscomparing it to the relationship between a husband and wife or a horse and its rider and later as between a parent and child these analogies while paternalistic and demeaning by todays standards were aimed at reinforcing the colonial hierarchy and legitimizing japanese dominance his speeches extensively covered in the keijo nippo reveal the religious and ideological zealotry that underpinned japans colonial policy including the forceful imposition of state shintoism on the korean populace\\n\\ndespite being the grand spiritual leader of imperial japan master imaizumi apparently experienced a dramatic fall from grace sometime between 1943 and 1944 because his death on september 11 1944 was marked by a notably perfunctory obituary reflecting his diminished stature today his works are no longer in print and have faded into obscurity largely forgotten even among japanese neoimperialists this decline in relevance could partly be attributed to his political outspokenness against the wartime policies of the imperial japanese military though these critical comments led to censorship of his works precise details of his criticisms are scant and remain a subject for further research\\n\\ntranslation\\n\\ngyeongseong ilbo keijo nippo may 9 1943\\n\\ni made a mistake by running for office\\n\\npreparing

the seoul prefectural assembly from 44 yeongdeungpodong had intended to run in the upcoming seoul prefectural assembly election on may 21st with the encouragement of many of his close supporters however before filing for his candidacy he came to know the significance of the nomination system and realized that running for office as a free candidate during wartime could disrupt the solid unity between the government and the people despite desperate pleas from his close supporters he visited gyeonggi province on may 7 and having resolved to even sever ties with old friends he announced his decision not to stand as a free candidate impressing the officials present\\n\\nmr kanemitsu was elected as a member of the gyeonggi provincial assembly in 1937 and he greatly contributed to his district by founding sinheung school and yeongchang school and by serving as the head of the local defense group the development of mr kanemitsus profound nationalistic ideas was unexpectedly influenced by the teachings of the kokugaku scholar imaizumi teisuke who had traveled around the korean peninsula last october preaching the true essence of the national body this has led to a deeper appreciation of master imaizumis remarkable influence on which mr kanemitsu commented as follows photo master imaizumi left and mr kanemitsu\\n\\nlistening to master imaizumis lectures can soothe anyones dissatisfaction with the world such is the virtue of the teacher i have been his disciple for a long time and it was always a pleasure to listen to his lectures every time i visited tokyo i remember him teaching that the true essence of the national body is to return to the gods this also means that once a policy is determined as the right way by those above those below must absolutely follow and promote it\\n\\nin that context even if there were some dissatisfactions with the nominated candidates i realized that standing as a free candidate would incite unnecessary competition and waste resources which would be an act against the nation therefore out of admiration for the teachers virtue i have steadfastly refused the persuasions of many acquaintances and decided against running as a free candidate it is rumored that i have already submitted my candidacy but that is certainly not the case even if i filed as a free candidate by mistake that would surely be dishonorable

impossible to write a concise summary of the 2018 season  you can get some of the details from the club guide below  but one of the most interesting stories actually comes from k league 2\\n\\nfor context you need to understand a bit about military service for footballers rather than take 2 years out of their career to serve in the military or do some kind of eg desk job service players can join one of two military football teams that play in the k league in k league 1 there is sangju sangmu and in k league 2 there is asan mugunghwa every player in these two teams is on loan for two years from another club in the k league sangju sangu is affiliated with the normal military whilst asan mugunghwa is affiliated with the police serving in the auxilliary police force is another way to do your service\\n\\nthe korean government recently decided to abolish the auxilliary police force by 2023 the police however decided to already wind down their sports teams putting an immediate halt on recruiting players and disbanding the teams in 2019\\n\\nnow the champions of k league 2 last season were asan mugunghwa they were in line for direct promotion to k league 1 to compete in the k league you need to have at least 20 players but by the time the next season started asan would only have 14 players as the loan deals ran out the league gave asan a deadline in november to submit a recruitment plan which they failed to do and so the promotion spot passed to secondplaced seongnam fc although that deadline and hence promotion was missed asan have how submitted a recruitment plan that would see their 14 serving players be supplemented by new signings that indicates the club will transition to an cityowned club with the help of the asan government\\n\\nfunnily or depressingly this is not the first time police fc won k league 2 and missed out on promotion  in 2016 ansan mugunghwa were crowned champions but at the end of that year moved from ansan to asan in line with the leagues policies they were registered as a brand new club\\n\\nk league 1 club guide\\n\\nclubs can have up to three foreign players in their squad plus an extra one from another afc nation although rare a player with north korea citizenship is not considered foreign most of those foreign places are taken by brazilians or players from the former yugoslavia eg k league veteran dejan damjanovic the exception to the foreigner rule is the goalkeeper  korean goalkeepers in the 90s were just so bad that a block on recruiting foreign goalieshttpwwwkleagueunitedcom201703foreigngoalkeepersinfavourofhtml was put in place to help encourage development of domestic talent it seems to have worked with korean goalkeepers often being signed abroad in asia at least\\n\\nthere is also a requirement to have u23 players fielded and on the bench with a failure to meet this impacting the number of substitutes that can be made article 30httpswwwkleaguecomaboutcompetition of the league rules\\n\\nyoull notice some of the clubs have a korean chaebol in their team name and even if its not in the name they may still be owned by a corporation behind the scenes this sounds very odd if youre not familiar with it but it is extremely common in japan china and korea it may just be a symptom of some of the teams being relatively recentlyfounded and perhaps isnt that unusual these days think red bull city group majority shareholders in the west however the number of citizen clubs owned by the local city or provincial government is on the rise  gyeongnam fc is one example\\n\\na lot of clubs probably like to think they have a derby with fc seoul because well its seoul but the  biggest and probably considered the national derby is the super match  between fc seoul and suwon samsung bluewings montenegrin damjanovic known simply as dejan formerly of seoul and now playing for suwon is the top scorer in this fixture\\n\\nheres the clubs by last seasons standing and since crests are a bit unstable on reddit at the moment heres an imgur album of all club crests and corresponding home kits for the 2019 seasonhttpimgurcomaw8dbla5\\n\\njeonbuk hyundai motors\\n\\njeonbuk are the dominant team in korea and one the of the teams you dont want to face in the champions league whoever you are theyve now won 4 out of the last 5 k league 1 titles and a most recent champions league title in 2016\\n\\ntheir rise to power over the last decade has been overseen by long term manager choi kanghee choi left at the end of last season to tianjin quanjintianhai daliang yifang fc in china korea seems to have a thing for portuguese managers these days and his replacement is one jos morais morais was assistant manager to jos mourinho for a period but as manager proper hes been a bit shit he was at two clubs in 2018 which included ushering barnsley into relegation to english league one how jeonbuk will fare after choi remains to be seen\\n\\nalthough jeonbuk cruised to the league title it would be difficult to call their season an outright success due to a horrendous 15 mins at the end of the second half in a home match against suwon in the champions league quarterfinal they turned the 3 goal deficit around in the seond leg when they travelled to suwon but went out on penalties \\n\\ngyeongnam fc\\n\\ngyeongnam were only promoted from k league 2 the previous season so coming second in k league 1 is something special top scorer in the league marco played his part with 26 goals\\n\\ngyeongnam will now feature in the champions league for the first time i thought that seems to have put the brakes on too many of their players departing but captain choi youngjun signed for jeonbuk in the winter transfer window a major loss is marco who was also top scorer in k league 2 in the year they were promoted who appears to have followed the money to china also off to china is key centreback park jisoo so basically the backbone of the team from defence to attack has left\\n\\nulsan hyundai\\n\\nknown as the horangi   the tigers  ulsan have had intermittent success in asia winning the champions league for the first and only time in 2012 in an unbeaten run\\n\\ntowards the end of the 2018 season ulsan were battling gyeongnam for the second spot which brings with it direct qualification to the champions league group stages rather than having a playoff they lost out but were widely expected to secure a direct qualification spot anyway when they faced daegu fc in the fa cup final ultimately they finished the season on a low losing 51 on aggregate to daegu in the final \\n\\npohang steelers\\n\\none of the few clubs that predates the formation of the k league pohang are another of the historical korean powerhouses they hold the record for the most number of champions league title 3 but their last title came in 2009\\n\\nfinishing fourth in the league they were hoping that ulsan would beat daegu in the fa cup final to pass their champions league spot on down but it didnt happen\\n\\njeju united\\n\\none of the original members of the k league founded as the yukong elephants in the seoul area as part of the decentralisation program they moved to bucheon kind of and were renamed as bucheon sk the decision to move to jeju in 2006 was an abrupt one and understandably deeply unpopular with the fans teams uprooting and moving elsewhere is a bit of a catalyst for the creation of new teams in korea and the fans formed bucheon fc 1995 in the absence of bucheon sk\\n\\nthe reason given for the relocation was to the address the imbalance in football teams being located around seoulgyeonggido and jeju did not have a pro team at the time but there are suggestions the owners sk group wanted to cut their investment and recoup some costs\\n\\nthere were recent rumours that jeju would move yet again back north to yongin but who knows \\n\\njeju had a pretty mediocre season what more can i say\\n\\nsuwon samsung bluewings\\n\\nsuwons 2018 season was a bit bonkers and especially so in their champions league run\\n\\nin their champions league group in which they were drawn with eventual winners kashima antlers suwon did not manage a single home win however they had managed to get two away wins and going into the final match they still had their fate in their own hands if they could win against group leaders kashima in japan they won 10 getting three away wins and topping the group\\n\\nmanager seo jungwon at a time when suwon were 4th in the league resigned the day before the first leg of their champions league quarterfinal clash with jeonbuk due to fan protests jeonbuk were apparently completely bamboozled by this event and took a 30 beating at home then in the return leg in suwon jeonbuk fought back to win 30 but suwon were able to scrape through on penalties to face kashima antlers yet again in the semis\\n\\nin the semifinal fixture suwon went 20 up against kashima antlers inside the first 10 minutes but went on to lose 32 in the first leg\\nsoon after manager seo returned as suddenly as he had departed having been gone for just 6 weeks  \\nin the second leg suwon went a goal down in the first half but came back with 3 in the second half to be on their way to the final after 60 mins played however kashima antlers fought back to get two more goals and win 65 on aggregate and would go on to win the final if you want to relive a part of that rollercoaster night here you gohttpsyoutuberxy8pagy1aq and heres an idea of the atmosphere that nighthttpstwittercomtheafcclstatus1055055104607285248\\n\\nat one point it looked like they might qualify for the champions league again for the 2019 season but suwon didnt win any of their final five league matches and dropped to 6th\\n\\nmanager seo left again at the end of the season and will manage japans sagan tosu recently captain kim eunsun was released from the club for drinkdriving the drama just never ends\\n\\ndaegu fc\\n\\nprior to the world cup daegu were languishing at the bottom of the table but after the return they found some kind of consistent form helped out by world cup hero goalkeeper jo hyeonwoo they really peaked at the right time as daegu made it to the fa cup final and against the odds defeated ulsan hyundai 51 on aggregate meaning for the first time they will feature in the champions league this is no mean feat for team whose best ever finish in the top flight is 7th place if they carry over their momentum into the 2019 season the year could be one of their most successful ever they will also be playing in a new footballspecific stadium this year\\n\\ngangwon fc\\n\\ngangwon are a fairly midbottom team i dont really know what to say about them they did have the 2ndhighest top scorer in the 2018 season though bosnian uros deric they also had the worst colour scheme in the league last season their kit is slightly improved this season\\n\\nincheon united\\n\\ni always like to imagine that incheon chose their strip so that they could be the inter to fc seouls ac milan they even have a nickname nerazzurri another nickname is the durumi    the cranes\\n\\nincheon spent most of the 2018 season at the very bottom of table and had the jointleakiest defence in the league they brought in norwegian manager jrn andersen midway through the season to turn their fortunes around but even after that they were on the wrong end or the biggest thrashing of the season 70 against gangwon coming into the end of the season though they were playing really nice attacking football even if they didnt always get the result at the split they were still bottom but won 4 out of 5 games to pull themselves up 3 places\\n\\nit was in attack that incheon shone montenegrin stefan mugosa was their top scorer in his debut season moon seonmin with the best goal celebration in the league also put in a strong performance but has now signed for champions jeonbuk nam junjae returned in the summer to score some bangers costa rican international aguilar was also impressive but has signed for jeju in the new season\\n\\nsangju sangmu\\n\\nthe military team where other k league players get loaned to to complete their military service their history goes far back in one sense as various military teams were playing way back to the 50s but they were founded for pro footballers to serve their time only in 1984 although they were for pro players they competed in the semipro national league until 2003 when they joined the k league based in gwangju when gwangju fc were formed they moved to sangju\\n\\nsangju sangmu do not have any foreign players for obvious reasons and cannot compete in the champions league although the chances of ever

competing for the title in the past decade nobody expected seoul to be fighting against relegation although relatively solid defensively they scored the least number of goals in the league season of all teams their star foreign players almost all left before the season started including dejan to rivals suwon and were not replaced with the same quality and for many matches seoul played with an allkorean team one bit of good news for the future is that former captain osmar will return from his loan to cezero osaka for the new season\\n\\nseoul at least managed to avoid relegation by beating busan ipark over two legs in the playoff helped by a red card in the first leg surprisingly they managed to score 3 goals in the first leg in open play\\n\\nseoul is probably the most popular club in

exporterhttpsenynacokrviewaen20190131006600315sectionsportsindex of players in asia in the transfer market this winter window was no different with what i would say were the two biggest stories involving young homegrown korean talent going abroad\\n\\nthe first is that of jeonbuk and national team star centreback kim minjae nicknamed the monster there were rumours of an offer from english side watford but it wasnt clear if there ever was any offer or negotiations  kim himself said he did not know of any interest from watford it doesnt really matter now  kim signed with chinese side beijing sinobo guoan and will see champions league football with them in the new season being drawn in the same group as jeonbuk\\n\\nthe second is hwang inbeom who has signed for mls side vancouver whitecaps hwang inbeom played in k league 2 last season with asan mugunghwa and daejeon citizen but has impressed as a midfield playmaker and is currently seen as a replacement for ki sungyueng in the national team\\n\\nfor a recognisable name for western readers the best i have is englishman jordon mutch who signed for gyeongnam from crystal palace resulting in this awkward photo ophttpspbstwimgcommediadzg3adzvyaakrkqformatjpgnamemedium another recognisable name is mix diskerud on loan to ulsan from man city but he joined the previous year\\n\\nk league 1s top scorer marco left gyeongnam for hebei china fortune and his replacement is luc castaignos signed from sporting cp his stats in europe havent been great in recent years but he may fare better in korea\\n\\nthere were of course a few hundred domestic internal transfers and number of other foreign player signings  if you want the full list k league uniteds winter transfer trackerhttpwwwkleagueunitedcom2019012019kleaguewintertransfertrackerhtml has it all\\n\\n\\n\\nhistory of club football in korea  establishment of the k league\\n\\nassociation football was first introduced to korea in 1882 when british royal navy crew harboured at incheon played a game it wasnt until the 1900s that football began to take hold and the first public match was played in 1905 there was a boom in in the 1910s with a number of football clubs being formed and rivalries began to form between clubs in seoul and pyongyang\\n\\nthe first nationwide competition was the all joseon football tournament joseon being the name for korea at the time founded in 1921 there wasnt actually a champion crowned in 1921 as the tournament was cut short due to complaints over refereeing decisions all this was taking place during japanese occupation of korea during most of the first half of the 20th century\\n\\naccording to the kfahttpswebarchiveorgweb20170606162658httpkfaorkrrecordhistoryasp football was the only tonic that could relieve the the national resentment that had accumlated in the hearts as a colony under the japanese empire and was a sprout that could foster the hope of freedom a tad hyperbolic maybe\\n\\none side effect of being a japanese colony is that some korean teams were allowed to participate in the emperors cup japans fa cup and in 1935 kyungsung fc kyungsung was a name for seoul during japanese occupation won the tournament becoming the only nonjapanese team to ever do so\\n\\nthe all joseon football tournament ran until wwii\\n\\nafter wwii came korean independence and shortly thereafter the korean war there was football being played during this period continuously when possible the korean national semiprofessional football league was founded in 1964 and is the predecessor to todays tier 3 national league many of the teams during this period were works teams  employed by a company playing under the name of the company but also having a proper job in the company cha bumkun said by some to be the greatest ever asian footballer rose to fame during this period albeit mainly in the bundesliga starting his senior career at the mighty seoul trust bank fc the most astonishing statistic about cha bumkun is he only received one yellow card in his career\\n\\nfinally we get to the establishment of professional football with the korean super league in 1983 now named the k league initially there were only 5 teams and 2 of those teams dropped out within 2 years the number of clubs in the top flight has varied from the initial 5 to a high of 16 in 2011 in 2013 the k league split into two tiers now k league 1 and k league 2\\n\\nfor the first few years of the k league teams did not have a fixed home stadium that they played in because there was no standard homeaway format that we are so familiar with today instead it was operated as a national tour\\n\\nthe k league in the modern era has its own history but one of the most interesting events was the forced exodus of all three clubs from seoul in 1996 as part of a policy to spread the popularity of football around the country also with an eye on stadium infrastructure for the 2002 world cup two of the clubs didnt move far only just outside the city of seoul each to one of seouls satellite cities yukong elephants only halfleft because the city they moved to didnt have a stadium yet so they continued to play in seoul until a new stadium was built for a number of years the k league was without any seoul representation in 2004 after the need to find someone to fill a great big national football stadium and help pay towards it one of those relocated teams moved back to seoul becoming fc seoul\\n\\n\\n\\nfootball pyramid  league format\\n\\nthe current system looks like this\\n\\n\\n tier  league  notes \\n\\n 1  k league 1 12 teams 1 relegation to k league 2 1 relegation playoff with k league 2\\n 2  k league 2  10 teams 1 promotion to k league 1 1 promotion playoff with k league 2\\n 3  national league  8 teams semipro no promotionrelegation\\n 4  k3 league advanced  12 teams semiproamateur 2 relegations to k3 league basic 1 relegation playoff with k3 league basic \\n 5  k3 league basic 11 teams semiproamateur 2 promotions to k3 league advanced 1 promotion playoff with k3 league advanced \\n 6 division 5 league 6 regional leagues with 52 teams some relegation to division 6 \\n 7  division 6 league 26 regional leagues with 174 teams some prorel with divisions 5  7 \\n 8  division 7 league 160 regional leagues with 960 teams some promotion with division 6 \\n\\nas you can see the naming is completely screwed up  k3 league occupies tiers 4 and 5 and division 5 is in tier 6 this is probably because the top tier k league only split in two in 2013 with the creation on k league 2 and nobodys been bothered to update their names\\n\\nthe national league sits stubbornly in tier 3 blocking any continuous prorel the powers that be have regularly stated that they want to reform the pyramid to have a continuous route from top to bottom at least to the bottom of k3 league within a few years but for some reason its not happening the winners of the 2006 national league season were offered promotion to the k league but they declined the offer the winners of the 2007 season were also offered promotion but declined again even though they said they would like promotion at the start of the season\\n\\none of the more recent additions to the k league bucheon fc 1995 joined from k3 league because they didnt want to pay the higher fees associated with starting out in the national league\\n\\noutside of this system there is the wk league the womens top tier the wk league has been dominated by incheon red angels no connection to incheon united in recent years theres no womens champions league in asia yet but for a few years in the past the winners of the wk league played the winners of japans nadeshiko league for a little more info on the wk league see this reddit posthttpswwwredditcomrwomenssoccercommentsaqkew5southkoreasroutetotheworldcupthewkleague\\n\\nalso worth a mention is the separate u league for universities and colleges some of the teams from which enter into the korean fa cup the route into a pro team in korea is often direct from high school or university teams something i dont think exists in europe some high school teams are even seen as feeder teams for a particular pro team i wont pretend to understand how the system works but ill leave you with the tidbit that park jisung was first signed to a professional team from a university team almost by accident as the scout had come to see a different player but took home park instead\\n\\nk league 1\\n\\nk league 1 consists of 12 teams playing 38 games the format is identical to the scottish premiership  all teams play each other three times and then after the split the top 6 and bottom 6 battle it out among themselves to settle the championship and relegation spots respectively the first tie breaker for teams level on points is goals scored rather than goal difference\\n\\nthe top 3 places offer a chance in the afc champions league the fourth champions league spot going to the winner of the korean fa cup bottom place gets relegated to k league 2 whilst 11th place has a playoff with one of the teams that finished 2nd4th in k league 2\\n\\ninternational context\\n\\nin the current format of the afc champions league the competition is split into a west region think uae saudi arabia qatar iran and an east region the east region is dominated by three nations  korea china and japan australia who decided it wanted to be asian earlier this century has also had a bit of success\\n\\nthis year there will be two debutants from korea  gyeongnam fc and daegu fc its dufficult to predict how well these two will fare but if they can carry some form over to this year they could get out of the group stages at least\\n\\ndetermining who has the strongest teams amongst the big three east asian nations is a difficult task and is hugely subjective im almost i say almost because obviously k league is best league of the opinion that theyre as close to equal as makes no difference korea has the most number of titles and the club with the most titles pohang steelers china have the highest coefficient japan has won the past two tournaments\\n\\nin recent years china and japan have had a number of big star foreigner signings eg paulinho torres which are absent from the k league i believe this is due to japan having cash mainly coming from tv money and china having cash from well being china despite korea lagging financially all three nations have the same limit on foreign players three foreigners plus one from another afc country and so korean teams are still competitive due to the relative strength of their domestic players\\n\\nwhile were on the topic of the champions league each of the big three east asian nations get 4 places total  2 or 3 to the group stages and 1 or 2 to the last qualifying playoff round before the group stages this playoff round is massively weighted in the big threes favour as they have to win just one home game when the weather is still genrally freezing cold against a team from a nation with a tropical climate i dont know of a korean club ever losing this playoff match\\n\\nthe afc cup is sometimes said to be the equivalent of uefas europa league but its not really comparable the afc cup is for the weaker asian nations only and korea arent allowed to enter\\n\\n\\n\\nresources\\n\\nwebsites  podcasts\\n\\nfor those of us

will be in korean but each video is really good quality typically about 10 minutes long\\n\\nif you watch to watch live the good news is that is very easy and basically free i have no idea whether any national broadcasters or streaming services around the world have k league rights but in korea itself essentially every thing is streamed on korean online behemoth navers platform the one caveat is

trains to stop exactly on time with the sirens and there is also the fear that a sudden stop could result in a traffic accident therefore when the sirens sound we stop the train as soon as possible

real beginners guide or anything like that there were a few specific faqs but not much to really help someone \\n\\nso id like help in order to create a onestop shop for everything involving finding teaching jobs in south korea ive only been here for two years though so id like your help in building one the beginning stuff is just things ive learned myself the rest id like you to help add towards\\n\\n\\n\\nbasic things to know\\n\\n1 qualified teachers like 9599 of english teaching jobs only enlist native english speakers from the big 7 countries the united states canada the united kingdom ireland south africa australia and new zealand these will be e2 work visa jobs while it is possible to get hired as an english teacher from outside of these countries i have a 20 year old dutch friend and she got hired as a teacher with a different visa than e2 its extremely difficult\\n\\n2 documents you will need to have all your basic country documents ready in order to teach if youre coming from these countries most of them just require an fbi or country equivalent background check and an apostille stamped fouryear college degree getting these two things will cost about 500600 us and take about three to five weeks time to complete after those two major documents youll also need your passport of course and usually have to pay for your own plane ticket to arrive over here which costs around 1000 on average some schools will reimburse you weeks or months later but they rarely pay out of pocket in advance and 1000 is a lot of money for job seekers\\n\\n3 research do your research on the school youre going to be working for unfortunately most recruiters hide the school names so you wont know what schools youll be applying to until the interview time but if you do find out the school name go online and look up what former teachers have to say about them also one other thing you wont be able to tell most of the time is what reputation large franchise schools have it can often vary wildly from location to location so there is usually no consistency to the experience of schools only a few mainly poly and chungdahmcdi have wide reputations and similar experiences at every school usually negative ones\\n\\n4 schools theres three types of schools you can teach at \\na public schools which are almost always in the mornings and have long hours like from 8am to 5 or 6pm these jobs are usually easier and treat their teachers better but have long hours and the same pay as positions with shorter hours \\nb afterschool academies or hagwons which usually have afternoon hours and can pay the most however most are franchises and many of them have intense teaching criteria bad management brutal work conditions or all of the above hagwons are the biggest gamble to work with \\nc adult teaching centers which there are only a few of ybm spep pagoda and berlitz and universities these are the hardest and rarest places to teach at and usually require a good three years of teaching experience in korea before accepting anyone they dont pay much more if at all and their hours are usually broken down into shifts mornings and afternoons but they are often the least amount of work you have to do in teaching\\n\\n5 students a kindergarteners which are age 7 and below are the hardest teaching positions for most they are always morning positions usually 8am to 5pm or 9am to 6pm and they usually are the most frequent job postings they mostly only seek to hire women to avoid predators which they assume most will be male and in all honesty are just glorified babysitting positions if youre fine with babysitting do kindergartens b elementary school kids which are between ages 8 and 12 which are fairly normal teaching positions however since theyre still kids much of it will still be babysitting at more prestigious schools like cdi the kids tend to be more wellbehaved and small schools the kids tend to be just as wild as kindergarteners c middle school kids in my experience tend to be the best middleground between wild little kids and bored teenagers middleschoolers are around age 13 to 15 some may be bad but most usually arent many schools have elementary students early in the day and middle schoolers later in the day its nearly impossible to find a position where you just teach middle schoolers d high schoolers tend to be lumped into adults as well so most students over 15 are essentially considered adult students and youll usually only get those at adult learning centers unless you get to teach at an actual high school which are rare as far as job postings go\\n\\n6 curriculums in my experience theres mainly three types of teaching theyll do at schools based on what kind of schools youll teach a conversational which is mainly just getting students to sound like native english speakers with a secondary goal of getting the student to enjoy their time there these are by far the easiest styles of teaching some hagwons offer these but most are only at adult learning centers so these are among the rarest positions to get in my opinion theyre also the best to teach and have the lowest pressure b general knowledge teaching which is not much different than teaching english in the west textbooks grammar comprehension vocabulary etc most schools have curriculums like these c test prep schools which are often hagwons and these schools just prepare kids for testtaking such as toefl or teofl jr these can be a mixed bag often they are repetitive and youll be doing the same thing over and over however more pressure is put on you for these schools and students getting good scores matter more these can often be the most stressful schools to work at since tests are such a big deal in korea\\n\\n7 locations the short version is the further away from seoul or busan you are the better chance you have of getting hired into korea a seoul is the hardest and toughest city to get into they mostly only look for attractive early20s white females getting into seoul not being this type of person is near impossible as a first year teacher b theres then the seoul suburbs gyeonggi county which includes uijeongbu guri hanam wirye seocho and seongnam you have a slightly better shot at getting into these cities but being an hour from seoul can still sometimes be a little competitive c busan the san diego of korea and jeju island the hawaii of korea can also sometimes be a little competitive as well nowhere near as hard as seoul though d you have a decent chance in getting hired in some big cities that arent near seoul such as daegu in the center of the country daejeon in the centerwest gwangju in the southwest and even incheon which is directly west of seoul e if you go out into the middle of nowhere your chances of getting hired will be a lot higher it is up to you to decide if you want to live in seoul or busan live an hour from seoul like in seongnam live in another big city thats not seoul like daegu or daejeon or live in the middle of nowhere\\n\\n8 cities a quick rundown of each major place in south korea seoul is like new york city the place you want to be if you like big city life seoul is really crowded and busy and has over 15 subway lines in it most housing in seoul is tiny and overpriced so it has its negatives to living there gyeonggi county has all the seoul suburbs an hour within the city these are smaller towns right outside the seoul city limits like uijeongbu guri hanam wirye and seongnam many of them still offer some big city amenities like bars shopping centers and restaurants so it wont feel exactly like youre in the middle of nowhere being there many buses or trains can take you to seoul within ease however theyre usually an hour long trip or so busan is the san diego of seoul a big beautiful beach city with pretty people in it its a little pricey to live there like seoul and a bit competitive to get work there jeju island is like koreas hawaii off the southern coast of korea its beautiful but hard to travel outside to the mainland on the weekends so youll often feel like youre stuck there its not for those who want to go to other cities on the weekend with ease incheon is technically its own city but most consider it to unofficially be west seoul its easier to get hired there than seoul itself daegu is a medium city in the middle of the country similar to dallas or houston in the us its said to have the most attractive singles there and the best nightlife outside of seoul daegu is notable for being inside a giant crater basin which means it gets really hot and humid in the summer daejeon is a big city and like the cleveland of korea but its extremely boring has almost nothing going for it for entertainment no lame timeworld doesnt count and feels more like a small town than anywhere else in south korea if you like big city amenities but want peace and quiet daejeon is for you\\n\\n9 applicants unfortunately race matters south korea openly discriminates most schools will require a photo to go along with your application and despite what anyone tries to say they will hire you or deny you based on looks much of their teachers are based on looks and not actual english skills or experience their ideal teacher is an attractive early 20s blonde white female if you are this mold pretty much anyone will hire you sadly the further you are outside this mold the harder it will be to find a job if youre a white male your chances will be only slightly less if youre nonwhite dark skinned your chances will go down significantly the hardest people to get a job here in korea are darkskinned or black males and nonkorean asians gyopos which are nonnative koreans like a koreanamerican fare a little better but only if they are fluent in korean otherwise they have a hard time getting hired too age also plays a factor as well age 2025 is what they look for the most 2630 is slightly less desirable and over 30 is even less desirable unless you have 5 years of korea teaching experience\\n\\n10 hiring to get hired you have to be consistent and talk to as many recruiters and schools as you can sending out 50100 emails to get one job isnt exactly uncommon if youre a young white female youll have the easiest time getting hired like youll be hired within two weeks or less if youre emailing recruiters daily the further you are from this demographic add an extra two weeks a white male four weeks of emailing a nonkorean asian six weeks of emailing a black person eight weeks of emailing and so on previous job experience outside of korea doesnt matter much they only care about you either fitting the look of a westerner young white and pretty or having serious teaching experience regardless of looks sadly this is the ugly side to teaching in korea however its not as bad as it seems and not everyone discriminates\\n\\n11 housing most schools like 90 will offer you free housing there is a housing allowance which is just free rent money these range between 300000 won a month to 700000 with 500000 being average the housing allowance to cover your rent is optional but most teachers take it if you can somehow find your own housing and willing to pay your own rent then that allowance goes back into your pay so youll be getting extra \\n\\n12 pay they pay once a month in korea the standard pay rate in korea for a beginning fulltime eight work hours teacher is between 2 million won a month roughly 2000 us and 22 million after a year or two youll usually be worth about 23 or 24 million a month after about three years or so you shouldnt be getting paid less than 25 or 26 million a month unless you like being ripped off pay for experienced teachers 5 years will be somewhere between 27 and 32 million a month including housing allowance most schools will pay by contract salary meaning youll get paid the same no matter what but some schools usually adult teaching centers will pay by the hour with a minimum base pay which is usually 2 million any school offering less than 2 million a won for full time work is ripping you off also know that teaching hours is not the same as work hours teaching hours are how much you teach but you usually have to come in before classes start and stay after classes are done for the day work hours are from when you clock in to when you clock out typically youll come in two hours before the first class and teach six hours for some elementary schools with long hours these can vary\\n\\n13 contracts contracts can be tricky to figure out there are contract reviews posted on here but the general rule is contracts are supposed to pay you the same amount unless you do overtime or didnt work certain days on time every time and are supposed to help pay for your health insurance and pension its common that certain schools will make you pay them back the airfare they reimbursed you for if you leave before six months pass on the contract schools are supposed to pay you one months worth after you complete one year with them after the three month probation period they are also not allowed to fire you without at least one written warning unless you do something majorillegal and must give you 3060 days notice before letting you go some schools will try to scam you out of money or make you do things that arent listed in the contract so if they try this always refer to the contract also as a good rule of thumb if a school has funky stipulations in it such as you cant work for any competitors within 5 miles for one year after leaving our school then its best not to sign with them contract reviews are good for avoiding getting screwed\\n\\n\\n\\njob posting resources\\n\\n facebook groups are a major resource because they are often direct posts from the schools or head instructors groups such as teaching jobs koreahttpswwwfacebookcomgroupstjinkorea english teaching jobs in koreahttpswwwfacebookcomgroupsenglishteachingjobsinkorea or job listings for english teachers in koreahttpswwwfacebookcomgroups1662820273984514 the downside is theres a few spammers on there as well

will do 100 of all the work for you make their jobs easier and theyll be more likely to help you\\n\\n3 getting additional certifications like toefl or any teaching certificates may help you before coming in but arent required for most places you also usually dont need to be an education major or have teaching experience in your home country most schools wont care and if they want anything at all will only want you to have korea teaching experience\\n\\n4 check the blacklists online for certain schools while everyones experiences are different the two schools i know everyone says are the most brutal and stressful schools to work at are poly and chungdahm cdi poly is supposedly horrendous everywhere while chungdahm which i have worked for in the past isnt a bad school per se but is extremely stressful has you working harder than anywhere else besides poly and also pays you the same as other schools starting at 21 to 23 mil meaning youre working harder but getting paid the same as people working half as much cdi is more diverse with their hiring though although that is probably intentional to get non whitefemales to sign on that other schools might not hire then exploit them so cdi isnt exactly allaround bad like poly is known to be but it is more work and stress for less pay\\n\\n5 there are dozens of job recruiters out there some of them are big names and post all over the internet some are not in my personal experience i would not recommend these recruiters they are either very discriminatory or a complete waste of time ace recruiting big company park english complete crap prime recruitment korea garbage and whizz crap\\n\\n6 teaching in korea can be hard for the first six months to 2 years the first two to six months can be really difficult then after that youll get used to things but still not be experienced yet to really have it be easy that takes at least two years or so so if it seems hard at first stick it out and keep your head up for many teachers the first year is just about surviving not quitting and running back home but it gets easier over time\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nso thats all i have for now anyone willing to suggest more to add i can do

a series of three educational articles published by the colonial regime to promote a heavily biased narrative of japanese and korean history from mythological times to the fall of the kingdom of baekje in 660 ad which the regime uses to justify its colonization of korea beginning with a visit to the historical remains of buyeo the former capital of baekje they narrate the long history of intimate cultural economic and military exchanges between ancient japan and baekje and how japanese military forces kept propping up baekje for centuries until they were finally defeated by silla and tang dynasty china in 660 ad then the second article shifts into bizzare speculation about the alleged mythological ties between ancient japan and silla how the second king of silla was allegedly the reincarnation of the shinto god susanoo how the son of susanoo allegedly landed at soshimori in silla and then settled in woongjin and how the greatgreatgrandson of susanoo allegedly used three ropes to drag silla into the realm of izumo actually the more mainstream interpretation of the story is that the three ropes were used to drag shimane prefecture into the realm of izumo in 1944

day\\n\\nbefore we go any further we must first confirm the location of the founding of the baekjehttpsenwikipediaorgwikibaekje kingdom although there is general agreement in written records that baekje was founded in the year 18 bce in the reign of the 11th emperor suininhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperorsuinin there are many different theories about where baekje was founded in korean historical records and in the nihon shokihttpsenwikipediaorgwikinihonshoki chronicles of japan which is the original source of japanese history nevertheless it is certain that king onjohttpsenwikipediaorgwikionjoofbaekje   who ruled over the waters of the han river in presentday seoul established his government in gyeonggido and built his residence on namhan mountain   dating back to that time sillahttpsenwikipediaorgwikisilla rose in 57 bce and in 37 bce gogoryeo rose by relying on the forces of china at that time silla was powerful and secretly supported the kumasohttpsenwikipediaorgwikikumaso tribe in japan to oppose the imperial court while at the same time silla allied with goguryeohttpsenwikipediaorgwikigoguryeo to bear down on the newly emerging baekje kingdom to check japans continental political ambitions\\n\\nin response baekjehttpsenwikipediaorgwikibaekje firmly established ties with japan and strictly defended itself but the power of their two enemies was not to be underestimated in the meantime the mythical yamato takeruhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiyamatotakeru defeated the kumasohttpsenwikipediaorgwikikumaso tribe in kysh at the order of the 12th emperor keikhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperorkeikc58d and when the 14th emperor chaihttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperorchc5abai passed away empress jinghttpsenwikipediaorgwikiempressjingc5ab took his place and led an expedition against sillahttpsenwikipediaorgwikisilla which was just one of many actions that the imperial court undertook to save baekje in the reign of the 21st emperor yryakuhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperoryc5abryaku however the war became more serious as silla and goguryeo once again increased their pressure on baekje and king gaerohttpsenwikipediaorgwikigaeroofbaekje   of baekje was killed in battle the royal court was moved to gongjuhttpsenwikipediaorgwikigongju for safety and the

pungjanghttpsenwikipediaorgwikibuyeopung   who was studying in japan at the time as the king of baekje emperor tenji also had his loyal retainer gwisil boksinhttpsenwikipediaorgwikigwisilboksin   reassemble a righteous army thus the territory of baekje was once again restored but after two years the dark lord pungjang executed the loyal retainer boksin and the country was once again in disarray creating an opportunity for tang dynasty china to intervene five japanese rescue attempts were unsuccessful and baekje was lost and the rescue forces returned to japan with the exiled baekje political refugees thus ending the long relationship between the japan and baekje later in the year 668 ad during the reign of emperor tenji goguryeohttpsenwikipediaorgwikigoguryeo was also defeated by tang dynasty china and sillahttpsenwikipediaorgwikisilla gained more and more momentum until finally in the year 681 ad during the reign of emperor tenmuhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperortenmu silla possessed most of the korean peninsula\\n\\nthe above is a general description of the relationship between japan and baekjehttpsenwikipediaorgwikibaekje but now i would like to deepen our discussions into the divine period and describe the process leading up to the reign of emperor jinhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperorc58cjin to clarify the proof of japanesekorean unification and to investigate the precious significance of the divine restoration of buyeohttpsenwikivoyageorgwikibuyeo the nihon shokihttpsenwikipediaorgwikinihonshoki tells a myth about susanoonomikotohttpsenwikipediaorgwikisusanoonomikoto the younger brother of amaterasuhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiamaterasu who willed a divine mandate to manage the continent and so he sent his son isotakeruhttpswwwjapanesewikicomshintoisotakeruhtml down to the land of sillahttpsenwikipediaorgwikisilla in soshimori from soshimori isotakeru moved to kumanasuminewoongjinhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiungjin   which is now in gongju cityhttpsenwikipediaorgwikigongju in chungnam province in the chronicles of the founding of izumohttpsenwikipediaorgwikiizumoprovince which is a collection of stories about the izumo dynasty since the reign of kuninushinomikotohttpsenwikipediaorgwikic58ckuninushi it unquestionably says that the izumo dynasty extended its rule stretching from the korean peninsula to the coastal areas of japan\\n\\nsusanoonomikotos greatgreatgrandson omizununokamihttpsjawikipediaorgwikie6b7a4e7be8ee8b186e5a5b4e7a59e desired the land of sillahttpsenwikipediaorgwikisilla and proclaimed i will cast three ropes on the land and pull on them thus it is said that he brought silla into the culture of izumo although it is beyond the scope of this article to go into detail about the myth of the three ropeshttpsjawikipediaorgwikie59bbde5bc95e3818de7a59ee8a9b1 there are numerous theories saying that sillas second king namhae of sillahttpsenwikipediaorgwikinamhaeofsilla    who is mentioned in the records of the three kingdomshttpsenwikipediaorgwikirecordsofthethreekingdoms was the reincarnation of susanoonomikoto the fact that and the peoples of silla and japan have mixed their blood for 2600 years proves the deep connection of the korean peninsula to the imperial nation\\n\\ntherefore when we consider that silla which destroyed baekjehttpsenwikipediaorgwikibaekje also had the blood of japan flowing through their veins and that the fearlessness of the soldiers of silla was a legacy of susanoonomikotohttpsenwikipediaorgwikisusanoonomikotos wisdom then silla cannot be viewed only as a hated enemy\\n\\nthus the izumo dynasty returned to divine rule and the coastal regions were unified with emperor jimmuhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperorjimmu completing his conquests and establishing his capital in yamatokunihara during the 860 years leading up to the reign of the 14th emperor chaihttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperorchc5abai the legacy of the izumo dynasty in subjugating korean territory was passed down through the generations of the imperial court however when silla once again attempted to invade baekje empress jinghttpsenwikipediaorgwikiempressjingc5ab assembled an army to send into distant korea to rescue baekje in the reign of the fifteenth emperor jinhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperorc58cjin when empress jing was regent dr wanihttpsenwikipediaorgwikiwanischolar   came to japan

of emperor jinhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemperorc58cjin baekje recovered friendship with japan deepened and cultural exchanges benefited japan to a great extent in response to this japan supported the defense of baekje and the foundation of unity between japan and baekje was completed thus generations of emperors maintained friendly relations with baekje along with the spread of buddhism in order to further solidify the spiritual bond between the two countries many baekje generals received an imperial decree to move to japan and the kings of baekje also sent their sons to japan for training in

memory market was valued at usd 66 52 billion in 2021 and it is expected to reach a value of usd 94 24 billion by 2027 registering a cagr of 5 33 over the forecast period 2022  2027\\n\\nnew york march 18 2022 globe newswire  reportlinkercom announces the release of the report nand flash memory market  growth trends covid19 impact and forecasts 2022  2027  httpswwwreportlinkercomp06246223utmsourcegnw \\nthe current macro trends of ai and machine learning mobility and connectivity are favorable to the nand markets and is expected to increase its share in the semiconductor market \\n\\nkey highlights \\nwith the rise of pcs and smartphones nand flash consumption is dramatically increasing much of which is attributed to the growth of the average capacity in smartphones this is expected to drive the demand for nand flash packaging thus influencing the demand for memory packaging \\naccording to micron the average smartphone contained 43 gb of nand flash storage and it is expected to grow substantially over the next four years by 2021 the company estimates that the average phone may have 142 gb of nand flash storage with flagship devices having one terabyte of flash storage \\nother consumer products such as tablets and cameras along with industrial equipment and sensors automotive systems and medical devices rely upon flash memory which is integrated alongside their processors that stores both data and the code they execute as demand for massive data processing for artificial intelligence and machine learning applications grows the trend for flashbased storage will continue to evolve \\nproduction of chinabased nand flash vendors was not severely affected by the outbreak of novel covid19 this is because the plants are highly automated have relatively low demands for manpower and operators are also stocked up with raw materials before the chinese lunar new year foundry output was delivered to customers in china because semiconductor fabrication plants hold national special licenses these allow them to ship their products throughout domestic china even with cities under quarantine \\nthe electronics device sector is anticipated to be impacted significantly by the covid19 outbreak as china is one of the major suppliers of raw materials and finished products the industry faced a reduction in production disruption in the supply chain and price fluctuations the sales of prominent electronic companies were affected during the period the travel restriction both of people and product hampered the markets growth in the short run \\n\\nkey market trends \\n\\nsmartphone segment is expected to witness significant growth \\n\\nflash memory storage has become an essential component in smartphones the nand flash demand has been growing exponentially primarily driven by the growth of the average capacity in smartphones \\nnand flash memory in smartphones can significantly enhance the performance of web browsing email loading games and even social network sites such as facebook with the increasing adoption of smartphones companies are adding extra features and applications to differentiate their products from other manufacturers \\nfor instance manufacturers are integrating features such as gesture control fingerprint scanners and gps into the devices this is boosting the demand for nand flash memory which is used as code storage media for smartphones \\nwith 5g wireless communication on its way the use of smartphones would increase multifold increasing the need for the latest models to raise the bar continuously for instance according to the ericsson mobility report in the north american region 5g subscriptions are expected to account for 55 of mobile subscriptions by the end of 2024 \\n\\nasia pacific to hold significant market share \\n\\nasia pacific is one of the biggest markets for nand flash memories across the globe the region has a very high demand from almost all the enduser applications primarily led by the demand for smartphones in multiple developing countries in the region such as china india and indonesia \\nalso there is a high activity from the semiconductor fabrication facilities in countries like china korea and singapore an immense amount of capital is directed into the chinese market by several multinational memory manufacturers especially boosted by the countrys government initiatives such as made in china 2025 the countrys ambitious goal is to reach usd 305 billion in semiconductor output by the year 2030 and meet at least 80 of the domestic demand for semiconductors which is expected to draw more investments into the country over the forecast period \\nmultiple new companies in china such as yangtze river storage technology fujian jin hua hua li and hefei chang xin memory are expected to invest heavily in the region these companies are also expected to double their equipment investments \\nowing to such development in multiple countries various competitors in the region are intensifying their efforts for expansion for instance as of february 2019 sk hynix one of the worlds largest memorychip makers announced that it is planning to invest a huge sum of usd 106 billion primarily to establish four new semiconductor fabrication plants in south korea in april 2021 the company held a completion

the third pony keg of beer was delivered it was decided that the next few days would be spent in the conference room discussing what we thought was the best way forward\\n\\nwe wanted dryerase boards so we could start taking detailed notes even though i was well ahead of the curve in that regard we instead ended up with some mobile elementaryschool blackboards and a pile of grainy sooty chalk \\n\\nleave it to dr cliff to go into a discourse on the genesis of chalk and its economic importance \\n\\nbloody carbonate geologists \\n\\nbloody white cliffs \\n\\nwe geologists need to punctuate their conversations with pictures so these would suffice quite well\\n\\nat 1700 hours the official end to the workday was called wed meet here again tomorrow im not certain by whom but it was readily agreed upon we were more or less on our own until 1000 the next day i needed to spend some time in my room with my notes and update a number of dossiers field notebooks and other items i was using as a running chronicle \\n\\nseveral folks decided to invade one of the hotels restaurants for dinner some wanted to head to the casino a couple wanted to get a massage and others wanted to do what tourists are normally wont to do on the second day of being a foreigner in a foreign land \\n\\ni declined invitations to dinner and other activities as i had a long writing session in front of me i wanted to get this all in its proper place while the memories and notes were still fresh \\n\\n30 minutes later in my room after a 25minute wait for the elevator im updating dossiers creating several new ones and updating my field notebooks suddenly after an hours work i notice something is amiss \\n\\ni dont have a drink or a cigar i said to the four walls this will not do\\n\\ni was used to happy hour in russia happy hour is slightly different there are no ice cubes or orangepeel twists in the vodka also it lasts all day\\n\\ni remedy that situation by finding and clipping a nice oily oscuro cigar and digging the bourbon out from under my boxerbriefs in my dresser drawer i heft the bottle and feel that its significantly lighter than when i left it last night i happen to look in the trash can and spy the wrapper for a box of my festively colored sobranie cigarettes i obtained back in dubai \\n\\nhmmm i think it would appear that we have some lightfingered cho louies or no louises around here id best guard my supplies a little more securely\\n\\ni move all my smokeables into one of my now emptied aluminum travel cases they lock with the stoutest of combinations and it will be readily apparent if anyone is fucking with them \\n\\ni move some of my best booze into the pretty much worthless inroom safe with a deft application of duct tape i seal the safe it may not be the most secure spot on the planet but if anyone tries anything troublesome theyll leave an immediately recognizable record of what they were up to its just too obvious theyd have to be crazy to go in after anything inside there \\n\\nmy money keys and passports are in the safe deposit box down in the lobby that the hotel supplies for visiting dignitaries even so they let me keep my shit in one of them anyway \\n\\nthat handled i spend another hour writing like a madman i suddenly realize im tired of all this and need a diversion as well as some food and of course drink \\n\\n30 minutes later im down in the byzantine basement tunnels of the hotel its crowded with hordes of chinse tourists and the casino is ground zero for the incredibly loud chatter \\n\\ni look in on the bowling alleys all three of them and theyre full the massage parlor is hopping although i leave my name and they promise they will call over the pa when a suitable masseuse is available evidently i intimidate some of the more demure ones\\n\\ni wander over to the bar now theres a surprise and see its packed to the rafters as well i decide to wait for a seat to open up on mahogany ridge when theres some gargling over the pa and a pair of chinese nationals leave the bar in great haste \\n\\ni grab one of the two newly open seats much to the chagrin of a couple of oriental unidentifiables ou who had their eye on them as well \\n\\nsorry mate i said first come first served its the capitalist way \\n\\none of the pair grabs a seat and the other just stands there looking annoyed unspent bullets in my direction forget that ive literally twice their size and could be an aberration as an angry american they just order a couple of drinks and content themselves in giving me dirty looks and probably say nasty things in their own indecipherable language about my national origin and familial heritage \\n\\nas if i gave the tiniest of rodental shits \\n\\ni fire up a cigar as literally everyone else in the joint was smoking something more or less tobacco however there was a definite barnyard aroma a regular dairy air in the room i think some of what was being smoked there was more bovine or equine in origin than botanical in nature \\n\\nwith numerous hilarious attempts at korean pointing at a garishly photographed drinks menu i was finally served a cold draft house steam porter and 100 milliliters of probably ersatz russian vodka vintage late last thursday this bartender that could at least form some of the phonemes found in american english a few a definite few\\n\\nsince it all cost the equivalent of us050 i really didnt care \\n\\napparently vodka helps flowers last longer when theyre dying but you can put vodka in anything and itll make it better\\n\\nbeing a trained observer i rather enjoy just sitting in any old bar smoking my cigar drinking my yorshch and watching people i try and not be intrusive and i never eavesdrop but i like to try and think of what strange set of circumstances brought us all here together in this place at this time it gives me writing ideas some of which i jot down in a notebook i always carry it also gives me a good shot of nostalgia when i look back at something i wrote some 40 or so years ago \\n\\nyeah old habits do die hard \\n\\ni take a drag off my cigar and set it in the ashtray in front of me on the bar as i go to correct another egregious misspelling in my notebook i have to immediately proofread what i wrote or id never recall later what the fuck i was trying to convey especially if its in a noisy smoky or murky milieu \\n\\nquicker than a bunny fucks unidentifiable oriental 1 uo 1 deftly reaches over snags my cigar and helps himself to a few mouthy puffs \\n\\ni look at him the empty ashtray directly in front of me him again and then uo 2 \\n\\nsince i speak no real oriental much less korean language and my mandarin at this point is worse than laughable i just point to the cigar turn out my hands and shrug my shoulders in the international what the actual fuck dude gesture \\n\\nhe just smiles a gappy toothy and snaggletoothed at that grin at me and makes a point of ensuring that i see him enjoying a few more drags on my own damned cigar \\n\\nnot able to contain myself any further i venture a what the fuck chuckles thats not your fucking cigar \\n\\nlike gasoline being tossed on a firering full of embers they both go unconditionally incoherently insane \\n\\nyammering chattering jumping up and down and getting right into my face they wanted me to unquestionably understand that my few words of english insulted them far more than their filching of my 20 cigar \\n\\nok im pretty well trained in hapkido an oddly given the present situation hybrid korean martial art im at least 6 or 7 inches taller and who knows how many stonekilospoundssolar masses heavier than these two clowns i could easily go all gojira on their hapless asses and mop significant expanses of the floorboards with them  \\n\\ninstead i look around for the bartender i figured since i was keeping him well supplied with korean won via tips and he spoke some english as well as perhaps whatever the fuck these characters were chattering maybe he could get to the bottom of what was happening \\n\\nthe bartender walks over and i ask him to ask the two unidentifiable twins why they stole my cigar \\n\\nhe nods in agreement and goes on in whatever the fuck dialect was being used today by the pair \\n\\nthey say they wanted it so they took it they ask what are you going to do about it the bartender relates\\n\\ni deftly reach inside my field vest as everyone concerned ducks and covers\\n\\ni extract two fresh cigars not a 454 casull magnum \\n\\ni give one cigar to the bartender and one to ou2 \\n\\nwith my compliments i pleasantly say \\n\\ni was well apprised of the fact that in certain places like this the local authorities often approach foreigners with for the lack of a better term agents provocateur \\n\\nlike the westboro baptist church they try to get a rise out of you so youll lose your cool and either create a scene or take a poke at the miscreant then they have all the pretext they require to drag you to the local hoosegow shake you down for every penny on your person as well as any phones notebooks wallets passports cigars cigarettes etc \\n\\nbasically they goad you into a fight then drop the thousandpound shithammer when you retaliate \\n\\nits all so parochial so obviously clear as vodka this elementary charade only raised a single eyebrow \\n\\nim not going to even raise my voice over a couple of cheap cigars that neither of them noticed i slipped them instead of the premium ones i was smoking \\n\\nthus defeated i asked the bartender to ask them if they liked the cigar \\n\\nwhat do you think i asked in cordial english too tightly rolled not caged enough too green\\n\\nuo 2 slipped and said it smells very good where he realizes hes blown his cover \\n\\nyeah i like it too i replied so much so i buy my own what are your badge numbers boys i will be reporting this incident to inspector paeng yeonghwan the head of security for the iupgs conference to which i was invited as special scientific consultant\\n\\nof course they immediately dummy up and feign illiteracy  \\n\\ni say loudly and very clearly you bastards arent gonna get away with this i mean what is going on in this country when scumsuckers like you can get away with trying to sandbag a doctor of geological sciences\\n\\ni ask the bartender to translate but alas it was too late they vamoosed when i turned to talk with the bartender\\n\\nthey left so fast they didnt notice me snapping their pictures with my ancient but trusty nokia 3310 revised edition during our little chat even with a mere 2megapixel picture i have enough to show the north korean leaders of the project to get an identification and make known my displeasure of being treated like some commoner or buffoon\\n\\nthey left both my cigar and the one i gave them the bartender tucked the cigar i gave him into his pocket and stared lustily at the two remaining on the bar \\n\\ntakeem i said i sure as fuck dont want them just a clean ashtray and a refill if you would be so kind i say as pleasantly as possible considering the situation \\n\\nboth the unsmoked and my smoldering as well as welltraveled cigar disappear as quickly as minks rut a clean new ashtray double beer and vodka suddenly appear \\n\\nno charge dr rock the bartender grins as he shoves my erstwhile highmileage cigar between his teeth \\n\\nok fair enough i say spaseebah and deposit a raft of won on the bar the pile wont be touched until after i leave in a few hours time\\n\\nstranger in a strange land i muse over a couple of further beers \\n\\nthe call from the massage parlor never came or it did and i couldnt hear it over the clamor of the casino i went up to the hotels korean restaurant had some salty soup a sad sad salad and some form of funky fish i think for dinner i retired that night in a slightly foul mood  \\n\\ni called es then the next morning and caught her before she retired with a 14 hour difference between us i was getting up at 0700 and she was getting ready to hit the hay at 2100 \\n\\ni told her of the events of the day previous and she was glad she wasnt tagging along she would have never accused the korean geologists of being behind the times and would have probably bent the guys nose that swiped my cigar \\n\\n agreed that shed probably be unimpressed with this place i promised her that wed go on a holiday when i returned from all this it would be up to her to find out where and id supply the when when i could\\n\\neverything else was going along smoothly more or less on the home front and i didnt want to give the local listeningin federales too much to say grace over so we said our parting admirations and rang off \\n\\nshower shower sunriser of real vodka and citrus a quick brush and comb and spiff of cargo shorts and new ghastly hawaiian shirt 30 minutes later back down in the restaurant for the inevitable breakfast buffet \\n\\nafter what some would consider breakfast and others would consider a vague attempt at nourishment we reconvened in the conference room precisely at 1012 \\n\\nnothing like precision with this group \\n\\nwe spend the next two days going over in various groups what we think would be required to set forth proper the quest for oil and gas in north korea on track everyone got in on the act and we advocated for that we needed everyones input to make this happen or to even map a way forward to present to country officials those from the west on what was needed and those from the east to tell us what was available and the combined wetware to make what needed to be done happen with what existed \\n\\nit took no small amount of doing but we secured a set of maps that covered the entire country we were watched very closely by the shiny suit squad that we did not copy photograph or otherwise take any extraneous information from these sheets of infamy all other maps in the country were intentionally skewed with errors deliberately added in to confuse interlopers spies or other personas non grata \\n\\ni made a massive stink and told them that if we didnt receive the unfuckered maps aerial photographs and satellite imagery pronto were packing up and leaving that afternoon \\n\\nwe dont have time for monks resisting the carnival we didnt come here to try and guess if the maps are correct or if our remedies will actually work on maps that say one thing and reality says something else entirely\\n\\nthey hemmed and hawed but as i made the announcement to all before lunch that if the real maps didnt appear by the time we returned from tiffin were gone\\n\\nand we take tiffin purty durn early round these parts buckaroo \\n\\nno one was surprised as i when we returned and there were folio after folio of governmentuncensored maps photos and imagery for our program i guess they finally reasoned it would be a relatively good idea to begin to take us seriously \\n\\nwe spent one whole day just going over our field geological apparatus they had a good idea of how to use a directionfinder compass and jacobs staff to measure sections however they were totally flummoxed by our brunton compasses gps systems curiously referred to as position finders notebook mapping applications and electronic data storage and retrieval systems \\n\\ngad it was like being back in the 1970s before pcs were a glimmer in ibms corporate orbs \\n\\nwe spent the next week working to bring our less fortunate colleagues up to well not date but at least up to the brink of the 21st century we explained that plate tectonics continental drift and the precession of the continents was accepted geoscientific principles not some arcane capitalist or socialist plot to undermine the quality of science in the east \\n\\nyep it was that mindset we had to first conquer i think weve made great headway in that direction today \\n\\nthe next chautauqua session had us split up into two separate groups we decided in a fit of cesarean inquiry to divide and conquer there are two distinct milieus which are able to contain economic deposits of hydrocarbons onshore and offshore  \\n\\ninstead of attacking both headon wed focus initially on the offshore domain  once we had a good handle on what was going on under the east korean sea the huangai yellow sea and surreptitiously the south sea wed collaborate our findings and work to tie them in and extend them onshore \\n\\nthe singular phyongnam basin is the one large depositional sedimentological and structural basin in north korea it is filled by the joeson and pyeongan supergroups of sediments which are cambroordovician and permocarboniferous respectively these are good hunting grounds for oil and gas could be elephanthunting httpsseekingalphacomarticle4298986murphyoilgoeselephanthunting country \\n\\nbut before we could undertake that we had to get back to basics that is we had to understand and delineate the frame of the korean peninsula in other words we needed to figure out how and when the peninsula came into existence \\n\\nsouth koreas geology is much more complex fortunately than that found in the north there were nasty side comments that were due to the relative development not of the geology but of the geologists who studied each countrys geology \\n\\nit was perhaps a mean way of characterizing the situation but unfortunately it was also probably fairly accurate \\n\\nthe korean peninsula is characterized by huge massifs  which are sections of a  crust that are demarcated by faults or flexures in the movement of the crust a massif tends to retain its internal structure while being displaced as a whole the term also refers to a group of mountains formed by such a structure its basically one huge semiresilient rock \\n\\nthe basement rocks of the korean peninsula consist of highgrade gneiss and schist paleoproterozoic precambrian massifs which formed in the early stage of earths history these rocks are unconformably overlain by metasedimentary rocks schist quartzite marble calcsilicate and amphibolite of the middle to late proterozoic the korean peninsula is floored by a collation of about five of these huge precambrian massifs that acted like microplates during the aggregation of the peninsula these massifs consist of thick dolostone metavolcanics and schist which were intruded by paleoproterozoic granites \\n\\nthese paleoproterozoic metasedimentary and granitic rocks underwent repeated intracrustal differentiation followed by the events of cratonization ie regional metamorphism and igneous activity at 1918 ga sediments deposited in the peripheral basins during the mesoproterozoic and neoproterozoic lead to stabilization as the basement of the peninsula\\n\\nthese early depositional basins formed the locus of deposition that continued on from the proterozoic through the phanerozoic there are at least three perhaps four depositional basins in the south which are delimited by structural zones such as the south korean tectonic line sktl a huge zone of continental transform faults and forms the basis of boundary demarcation between the okcheon and taebaeksan basins\\n\\nthe boundary between the seochangri formation of the okcheon basin and the joseon supergroup of the taebaeksan basin in the bonghwajae area is a thrust or reverseslip shear zone this thrust is presumably a relay structure ie a restraining bend between two segments of a continental transform fault the south korean tectonic line or sktl along which the okcheon basin of the south china craton was juxtaposed against the taebaeksan basin of the north china craton during the permiantriassic suturing of the two cratons\\n\\nin the late proterozoic sedimentation was initiated in basins of the korean peninsula  accompanied by deposition of siliciclastic and volcaniclastic sediments as well as carbonates the massifs were submerged in the early paleozoic during a greenhouse period forming a shallow marine platform and associated environments\\n\\nthe cambrianordovician succession unconformably overlies precambrian granite gneiss it consists of mixed carbonatesiliciclastic rocks of sandstone shale and shallowmarine carbonates sedimentation was initiated in the early cambrian with a global rise in sea level on the stable craton of the sinokorean block\\n\\nthere was a major break in sedimentation during the silurian and devonian periods in the entire platform during the carboniferous to early triassic sedimentation was resumed in coastal plain and swamp environments with progradation of deltas\\n\\nmajor tectonic events were initiated in the triassic when the south china block collided with the sinokorean block the eastern part of the sinokorean block rotated clockwise and moved southward relative to the south china block along the sktl\\n\\nin the middlelate jurassic orthogonal subduction of the paleopacific plate under the asian continent caused compression and thrust deformation a number of piggyback basins formed along the thrust faults in the east of the sktl at the same time the entire peninsula was prevailed by granite batholiths especially along the northeastsouthwesttrending tectonic belt\\n\\nin the cretaceous period the paleopacific plate subducted northward under the asian continent forming numerous extensional leftlateral strikeslip basins in the southern part of the peninsula and the yellow sea a large backarc basin was initiated in the southeastern part\\n\\nin the paleogene both the volcanic arc and the backarc basin ceased to develop as volcanic activities shifted eastward accompanied by a rollback of the subduction of the pacific plate in the miocene pullapart rightlateral basins formed in the eastern continental margin\\n\\nthe korea plateau experienced continental rifting accompanied by extensive volcanism during the extensional opening of the southern offshore basin it subsided more than 1000 m below sea level\\n\\nso as south korea was mix mastered by a halfabillion years worth of structural tectonism which created several depositional basins quite capable of generating and storing economic quantities of oil and gas the scene to the north was much more quiescent \\n\\nthe north was composed from south to north of the relict imjingang belt which was an old backarc basin between the gyeonggi massif to the south and the nagrim massif to the north it is a paleosubduction zone full of volcanics volcaniclastics and other nonhydrocarbon bearing rocks it was mashed and metamorphosed and basically forms a convenient boundary between the complex geology of the south and the more relaxed geology of the north \\n\\nheading north we come across the pyeongnam basin the only north korean basin thus far defined that could contain hydrocarbons further north is the huge nangrim massif its a huge block of igneous and metamorphic rocks that weather very nicely and form some spectacular scenery but from an oil and gas economic outlook are worthless \\n\\noffshore north korea there are two possible petroliferous basins the offshore west korea bay basin and east sea basin along with five onshore basins could be offering exploration potential at least ten exploration wells have been drilled in the west sea with some showing good oil shows along with the identification of a number of potential reservoirs\\n\\nthe west sea potentially has oil and has reportedly flowed oil at reasonable rates from at least two exploration wells when they were drilled and tested in the 1980s  meanwhile the east sea has seen russian exploration efforts previously including the drilling of two wells both of which reportedly encountered encouraging shows of oil and gas\\n\\nonshore there has been little exploration to date apart from efforts by the korean oil exploration corporation and also recently by mongolias hboil jsc hbo among five main onshore sedimentary subbasins the largest is south of the capital while unconfirmed reports point to a 1trillioncubicfoot tcf discovery in 2002 \\n\\nhistorically dprk was thought to consist of five underexplored geological basins the \\n\\n\\tpyongyang\\n\\n\\tzaeryong\\n\\n\\tanjuonchon\\n\\t\\n\\tgiljumyongchon and\\n\\t\\n\\tsinuiju basins\\n\\t\\nthese basins are all located more or less along the coast rather than inland this also points to a certain degree of geological aptitude as its much easier to explore along the more populated coast than it is to venture inland there may be more hiding in the interior of the country its just that no ones looked as of yet thats difficult exploring along the coast is much easier \\n\\nwith 3 basins supposedly proven to have working petroleum systems 22 wells have been drilled and the majority are said to have encountered hydrocarbons with some wells testing production at 75 barrels of oil per day of light sweet crude oil this has yet to be documented or confirmed by the korea oil exploration corp koec north koreas staterun oil company\\n\\nyeah our work was definitely cut out for us \\n\\nit was decided that a series of excursions offshore in one of the few remaining seaworthy which was a real judgment call koec seismic boats would be appropriate the one we received use of was an old decommissioned chamsuriclass patrol boat one chamsuri215215 pkmr215 in particular \\n\\nit had been basically stripped to the gunwales and completely retrofitted as a seismic acquisition and recording vessel it had been renamed      or  glory of democratic peoples republic of korea science\\n\\nin reality it was an aging rustbucket piece of shit that might have possibly seen better days but wasnt letting on all the military nonsense except the powder magazine had been removed and a new superstructure consisting of slapdash hunks of poorlywelded lowcarbon coldrolled steel were erected to form a pilothouse in the area where the bridge once existed they also built extra haphazardly a shooters room galley cold and wet storage areas recording room and storage of tapes and the extra bits and pieces needed for a nonetooextended stay on the sea it was being charitable almost utilitarian \\n\\nthey could not make their own water so trip times were limited to about three days in length besides they didnt really have a hot galley so it was cold canned chinese chow for the next 72 hours they had a couple of fairly sturdy yardarms with heavy winches to handle the towed seismic arrays of geophones which were of ancient heritage and showed it these were probably appropriated back in the 80s or perhaps earlier when they first thought about opening their waters for seismic exploration \\n\\nthey borrowed most of the sensing and recording equipment back then from oilfield service companies and simply forgot to return it once finished since they burned that bridge so glowingly they couldnt get parts nor service when things failed being delicate seismic sensing and recording equipment fail they did \\n\\nso we had to use what was leftover or what dprk industries could cobble together or what could be salvaged from saltwater drenched recording equipment that hadnt been too heavily cared for over the span of the last 50 years \\n\\nwe werent terribly optimistic \\n\\nso we load the good ship rorrypop as viv christened the thing and head out to the wilds of the yellow sea it was an abbreviated foreign crew as there was really nothing other than upchuck and curse me soundly for insisting the nongeophysical scientists came along \\n\\naboard were the two geophysicists naturally volna and activ i was there stickhandling the logistics and hoping to help out with the geophysical signal source explosives \\n\\nmorse and cliff the two other geologists accompanied us on the trip and dax decided to go with me as he figured id have access to the best booze no matter where we went \\n\\nthe remainder of the team the geochemists erlan and ivan the geomechanic iskren the pt joon and the two res viv and grako remained behind onshore at the hotel they set forth cataloging what data was available from what sources its vintage veracity and usefulness \\n\\naugean tasks both not as fecaliferous as hercules jobs but still they held their own rations of shit for each subteam \\n\\nheading seaward the yellow sea extends by about 960 km 600 mi from north to south and about 700 km 430 mi from east to west it has an area of approximately 380000 km2 150000 mi2 and a volume of about 17000 km3 4100 mi34 its depth is only 44 m 144 ft on average with a maximum of 152 m 499 ft the sea is a flooded section of the continental shelf that formed during the late pleistocene some 10000 years ago as sea levels rose 120 m 390 ft to their current levels the depth gradually increases from north to south the sea bottom and shores are dominated by sand and silt brought by the rivers through the bohai sea and the yalu river these deposits together with sand storms are responsible for the yellowish color of the water referenced in the seas name\\n\\nbeing shallow the yellow sea is more perturbed by the frequent seasonal storms of the region the area has cold dry winters with strong northerly monsoons blowing from late november to april i was told that the summers are wet and warm with frequent typhoons between june and october but now all we had to contend with were swelling seas spraying saltwater waggling waves and a shivering shimmying ship \\n\\nall the navigation communications and other shiply duties were being handled by both members of the dprk coast guard auxiliary mostly older guys who were of great and high humorous jest and an actual pleasure to be around they were like their scientific cadre on this cruise basically a political give a shit attitude and a desire to get the job done smoke the americans cigars and drink as much as we could get away with \\n\\nthe scientific portion of the cruise was being undertaken by students of the various universities and members of the north korean national oil company the demeanors of these characters ranged from extremely earnest and stringently north korean politically correct in the students and academicians to a more relaxed yeah lets just get the fucking job done so we can have a lot of drinks sort of view of the older members of the dprk scientific team \\n\\nit was a fun admixture of cultures ages professions and behaviors \\n\\noh forgive me for forgetting to mention our guides or handlers they were also chosen nay ordered to come along landlubbers all they were less than thrilled with the assignment and inevitable seasickness which seemed endemic to those of oriental extraction on the cruise however our guides did enjoy drinking as we learned that alcohol is a central part of korean culture and they encouraged us to socialize with them when the time was appropriate \\n\\nor not appropriate as i was being denounced by one of the geophysical students after only a few hours into our very first day hell we werent even in the yellow sea proper we started here at pyongyang down the taedong river over the giva dam through pushover across shmoeland to the stronghold of shmoe into the very belly of the frothing yellow sea\\n\\nmost everyone other than the foreign elements on board were either making the trip in the bowels of the ship nursing and cursing seasickness or by rail doing exactly the same thing \\n\\nchum it over the side ya blinkered mucker i admonished one bottlegreenish national this aint the captains mess chuckles you have to clean up your own spew\\n\\ni was reveling in getting back out on the water and regaining my sea legs i never get seasick \\n\\nnever\\n\\never \\n\\nbe it a seismic vessel in the heaving arctic ocean a pirogue in the swamps of louisiana my cousins fishin johnboat back in northern baja canada a us nuclear submarine under the permanent pack ice of the north pole or vlcc in the straits of somaliland i just dont get seasick\\n\\nairsick nah carsick nope ready to puke in a hind20 over the caspian sea during a strong local thunderstorm close but no cigar \\n\\nso im doing a titanic scene recreation up in the very bow of the craft standing in stark defiance of the gusting winds and blowing salt spray smoking a huge cigar and totting out of one of my emergency flasks while trying to hang on to my stetson i am also endeavoring to remain upright field vest and really really ghastly hawaiian shirt billowing in the breeze \\n\\nim not certain if it was the cigar smoke the windwhipped beard and hair the give a fuck attitude or the flapping of the hawaiian shirt to which the little local geophysicist objected but he was pissed olivegreen with seasickness rubberkneed but still standing a good socialdistance away reading me the riot act in highpitched korean  \\n\\nas i usually do in such delicate situations i just smile and wave show them im mostly harmless and they either cool down or get pissed off even more and stomp off in disgust \\n\\neither one was a winning situation for me in my book \\n\\nso i return to doing my ships figurehead imitation and revel in the wind spray and feeling of really being booming sure some might complain of the cold but not me the sting of the saltspray or the windburn but i eschew what most people enjoy as normal weather i live for pushing the boundaries i love rough weather and situations that thrust the edge of the envelope further past normalcy \\n\\nbesides we were still in sight of land hell if everything went south at this very minute one could practically walk back to shore i can hardly wait to see what these wigglers will do if a night storm comes up when were 100 or more kilometers from land \\n\\nthe boats thrumming heavily from both the thrust of the sovietera diesel engines and the crafts bludgeoning its way through the waves most hull designs are so the ship will cut through the surface waters this crafts flattened trihedral hull design didnt so much cut as slam its way through the boat would then crash up one side and smash down the other of each large wave we encountered the boat would shudder whole adding a new note of resonance along with the monotonous onenote song of the aged russian diesels \\n\\nthe spray would fly the boat would convulse time would seem to freeze until we bashed into the next wave the captain of the vessel took his orders very seriously get to coordinates xxx and yyy by the most expedient means possible if that meant charging fullthrottle into the teeth of the oncoming monsoonforce wind while we were traversing the worst kelp jungle ive seen this side of the sargasso sea well piss on it full steam ahead \\n\\nfuck it i thought not my pony not my show lets see how this plays out while i light a new cigar and search for emergency flask 2\\n\\nafter id been upbraided by the geophysical student for transgressions still unknown cliff and dax wander out to ask me what the hell i was up to \\n\\nhave you gone completely barmy cliff asked its a full gale out here and youre standing in the teeth of it like it was a warm sunny sunday in piccadilly\\n\\nnope not at all i replied just reveling in the delights of an angry atmosphere\\n\\nhes nuts i told you dax smirked hed go anywhere and do anything to have a cigar\\n\\nnot just a cigar me old mucker i smiled and waved my second emergency flack under his nose \\n\\nfigures they both respond in unison \\n\\ndax departs and returns mere seconds later with

around seoul and teach business clients\\n\\nsometimes the clients come to our classrooms if they are lower level  employees sometimes it can be a group other times it is oneonone  \\n  \\nif the clients are more higher ranking like executives you gotta go to them the executives have secretaries who communicate with spep personnel the spep personnel then contact you to tell you they have to cancel after awhile the secretarys just start contacting you directly  through kakao talk or email because that makes sense spep doesnt like that because they want to be in control of all communication the policy is supposed to be if the client cancels on the same day then they lose that time but it does not always happen that way and the company pressures you to make up the time regardless of when the client cancels regardless you spend tons of time communicating and trying to reschedule because you might have like 20 executives in one week its insane and i didnt get any secretary or someone to handle my crazy schedule which started at 7 am and ended at 9 pm  \\n  \\nreddithttpswwwredditcomrhagwonblacklistkoreacommentsg1p520koreaspeponestopprep  spepthe princeton reviewin times in aug 13 2020  \\n  \\nfor starters the head office is in seoul but you wont be working there they will let you believe that you will be working in seoul but instead they want you to bounce around between locations that are far apart so you spend your whole day in a car but of course you dont get paid\\n\\nin short there is commute time that is not compensated and clients cancel too often then demand makeup classes that clog up schedules i can imagine wasting time going to an office then having to turn around and go to the next client only to have to waste another hour at a different time on a different day coming back to reteach the same client so lets say 7 clients a week cancel and reschedule thats not only 1 hour of lost classroom time but also the commute you cant go home you have to wait out that time somewhere its a lost block between clients then have to commute again and teach another 1 hour how much time is lost and wasted with 7 clients that do this there is inevitable pay disputes and because of the volume of clients cancelling the entire week is either classes or makeup classes as it is in college and what i told my private 11 students you pay for the semester but if you miss class im keeping your money if i miss class we have a make up date the threat of losing money keeps them honest do sick injured drunk lazy college students get make up classes certainly not korean adults are notorious for cancelling and not caring about who is putout by it and management is godawfully terrible at schedules its best not to involve them at all to save your sanity no wonder spep staff was bypassed as an additional 3rd party confuses the situation even worse\\n\\nx200b\\n\\ndivision 2 teachers go outside of seoul to teach hyundaikia employees at their various assembly plants\\n\\nthere are factories and subsidiaries outside of seoul spep trains the staff and has meetings in seoul it is kind of expected that youll live in seoul then theyll bus you to these remote locations super early in  the morning they will not compensate you for this time on the bus this all comes as a shock after you already started the job or at least thats how it was one day you think youre gonna be teaching  professionals in seoul then the next day youre told youre gonna have 4 hours of bus rides everyday all over to different factories all of  which is unpaid thats the insanity sometimes clients will cancel at  the last minute youll get paid for that but the client will still  find a way to message you and pressure you to make up the class somehow  youll never have any personal life cause youre up at 5 am and home at 10 pm  \\n  \\ni never had to do this commute but from what i understand you dont get paid for the commute on the bus if the client cancels you get paid but there will be many a time when the client will want the class  to be made up so the next time youre out at that factory theyll try to get you to make up that class youll only get paid for one class though would have to verify with the teachers who had to this ridiculous commute  \\n

electronics nowhere to go and no food the cafeteria on campus was only open for an hour each day but i was forced to teach during its open hours every day because some students preferred to use their lunch time for english classes this meant that i would sometimes go 10 hours a day without food because i had access to nothing but a single small convenience store that often closed throughout the day only when i threatened legal action against this did they finally allow me lunches again but it was the first of many legal threats id have to make to get fair treatment  \\n

in korea southern gyeonggido edition', 'selftext': 'a few days ago a weirdo foreigner decided to post the original weirdo foreigners post from this subreddit on a popular facebook group their goal was apparently to encourage other foreigners to flame the admin here and invade the subreddit there was tons of flaming on facebook but the post also seems to have made several more people aware of this awesome community welcome to this wonderful judgment free zone\\n\\none of my close friends saw the post on facebook and asked me if i would be willing to share our experiences with weirdo foreigners here on the hagwonblacklistkorea subreddit my friend is definitely an advocate for the equality of foreigners here in korea including english teachers thats what led us to establish a language exchange community in our city to allow foreigners and koreans to learn each others languages and find true friends however we have encountered some truly strange characters these past six years ill start by discussing one of the most problematic people weve met\\n\\nfive years ago we met a canadian woman at our language exchange meetup for the purposes of anonymity ill refer to her as the canadian woman here my friend is a korean man so english is not his native language the canadian woman would publically mock him for his lack of english proficiency she also refused to acknowledge or appreciate any feedback korean members gave her regarding her pronunciation or grammar this subreddit tends to focus on how korean hagwon management mistreats foreign teachers however the rude behavior of the canadian woman is evidence that the disrespect is sometimes directed towards innocent people here in korea\\n\\nin addition to her maltreatment of the language exchange members she was also quite rude to her fellow english teachers she publically admitted one of her goals of teaching english in korea was to one day meet and marry a korean man however when i openly admitted i had a desire to date a korean woman she accused me of only being interested in one night stands i dont discourage others from engaging in promiscuous behavior but i never had a one night stand in my entire life additionally when another foreigner bragged about sleeping with multiple women and showed off a list of their english and korean names and how many times they had relations the canadian woman said his behavior was perfectly acceptable in her mind its fine to treat women like trophies or pokemon as long as youre not me i guess\\n\\nmy friend and i decided to move our language exchange to suwon since our town was too small to attract many regular members the canadian woman got angry at us and stated that she would never attend the new meetup because suwon is too far in reality its about a 30 minute commute from where she lived my best friend had the misfortune of living and working with the canadian woman at this time she told him several times that she was upset about not being able to meet men in our community its impossible to feel sorry for her lack of success in dating when she wasnt willing to take a short commute to a bigger city the majority of my dates happened in suwon because i didnt use distance as an excuse to stay single im sure there are many foreigners with a similar mentality to the canadian woman some cities may not have a great dating scene for young adults but if theyre not willing to travel a bit for a date then i cant feel sorry for them\\n\\none day my friend invited my friends and i to an impromptu get together at a cafe since he happened to be downtown the canadian woman heard about the meeting and made an assumption that it was a language exchange that she wasnt invited to she proceeded to walk into the cafe and scream while swearing at my friend publically in broad daylight the staff and customers were very disturbed by her behavior it would be unacceptable anywhere in the world but korean culture in particular frowns upon confrontation and yelling in public my friend never received an apology for his traumatic experience at the cafe either\\n\\nbased on these anecdotes the canadian woman was a very strange antisocial person its difficult living abroad but she rejected community from both local korean people and her fellow foreigners as well her rude behavior in public especially swearing and yelling surely damaged the reputation of english teachers within our town \\n\\non a broader scale within the hagwon industry she defended the shady business practices of her hagwons management until the government forcibly shut down the entire micky mouse operation for example when my then current job did nothing to prevent korean staff members from harassing my coworkers and i the canadian woman simply said all those american teachers will just be out of korea in a year anyways its offensive to be a bystander to the corruption of hagwons but its downright criminal to encourage the corruption while other foreign teachers suffer and continue to be exploited\\n\\ni hope that my fellow members on this subreddit can reflect on the negative impact the canadian woman caused within both korean and expat society there are thousands of decent innocent english teachers here in korea that are being exploited by their bosses and isolated from other foreigners if the situation is going to improve on either front we must be proactive if we work together we can expose corruption we can also treat our fellow foreigners with kindness and respect to help ease their pain while working at hagwons where theyre essentially indentured servents\\n\\ni have six years of stories to share here perhaps next time ill talk about the aussie boomer'}, {'title': 'general discussionmeetup thread  week of

2s busan ipark  \\n seongnam fc were promoted from k league 2  \\n ulsan won their champions league playoff and are in the group stages\\n\\nits impossible to write a concise summary of the 2018 season  you can get some of the details from the club guide below  but one of the most interesting stories actually comes from k league 2\\n\\nfor context you need to understand a bit about military service for footballers rather than take 2 years out of their career to serve in the military or do some kind of eg desk job service players can join one of two military football teams that play in the k league in k league 1 there is sangju sangmu and in k league 2 there is asan mugunghwa every player in these two teams is on loan for two years from another club in the k league sangju sangu is affiliated with the normal military whilst asan mugunghwa is affiliated with the police serving in the auxilliary police force is another way to do your service\\n\\nthe korean government recently decided to abolish the auxilliary police force by 2023 the police however decided to already wind down their sports teams putting an immediate halt on recruiting players and disbanding the teams in 2019\\n\\nnow the champions of k league 2 last season were asan mugunghwa they were in line for direct promotion to k league 1 to compete in the k league you need to have at least 20 players but by the time the next season started asan would only have 14 players as the loan deals ran out the league gave asan a deadline in november to submit a recruitment plan which they failed to do and so the promotion spot passed to secondplaced seongnam fc although that deadline and hence promotion was missed asan have how submitted a recruitment plan that would see their 14 serving players be supplemented by new signings that indicates the club will transition to an cityowned club with the help of the asan government\\n\\nfunnily or depressingly this is not the first time police fc won k league 2 and missed out on promotion  in 2016 ansan mugunghwa were crowned champions but at the end of that year moved from ansan to asan in line with the leagues policies they were registered as a brand new club\\n\\nk league 1 club guide\\n\\nclubs can have up to three foreign players in their squad plus an extra one from another afc nation although rare a player with north korea citizenship is not considered foreign most of those foreign places are taken by brazilians or players from the former yugoslavia eg k league veteran dejan damjanovic the exception to the foreigner rule is the goalkeeper  korean goalkeepers in the 90s were just so bad that a block on recruiting foreign goalieshttpwwwkleagueunitedcom201703foreigngoalkeepersinfavourofhtml was put in place to help encourage development of domestic talent it seems to have worked with korean goalkeepers often being signed abroad in asia at least\\n\\nthere is also a requirement to have u23 players fielded and on the bench with a failure to meet this impacting the number of substitutes that can be made article 30httpswwwkleaguecomaboutcompetition of the league rules\\n\\nyoull notice some of the clubs have a korean chaebol in their team name and even if its not in the name they may still be owned by a corporation behind the scenes this sounds very odd if youre not familiar with it but it is extremely common in japan china and korea it may just be a symptom of some of the teams being relatively recentlyfounded and perhaps isnt that unusual these days think red bull city group majority shareholders in the west however the number of citizen clubs owned by the local city or provincial government is on the rise  gyeongnam fc is one example\\n\\na lot of clubs probably like to think they have a derby with fc seoul because well its seoul but the  biggest and probably considered the national derby is the super match  between fc seoul and suwon samsung bluewings montenegrin damjanovic known simply as dejan formerly of seoul and now playing for suwon is the top scorer in this fixture\\n\\nheres the clubs by last seasons standing and since crests are a bit unstable on reddit at the moment heres an imgur album of all club crests and corresponding home kits for the 2019 seasonhttpimgurcomaw8dbla5\\n\\njeonbuk hyundai motors\\n\\njeonbuk are the dominant team in korea and one the of the teams you dont want to face in the champions league whoever you are theyve now won 4 out of the last 5 k league 1 titles and a most recent champions league title in 2016\\n\\ntheir rise to power over the last decade has been overseen by long term manager choi kanghee choi left at the end of last season to tianjin quanjintianhai daliang yifang fc in china korea seems to have a thing for portuguese managers these days and his replacement is one jos morais morais was assistant manager to jos mourinho for a period but as manager proper hes been a bit shit he was at two clubs in 2018 which included ushering barnsley into relegation to english league one how jeonbuk will fare after choi remains to be seen\\n\\nalthough jeonbuk cruised to the league title it would be difficult to call their season an outright success due to a horrendous 15 mins at the end of the second half in a home match against suwon in the champions league quarterfinal they turned the 3 goal deficit around in the seond leg when they travelled to suwon but went out on penalties \\n\\ngyeongnam fc\\n\\ngyeongnam were only promoted from k league 2 the previous season so coming second in k league 1 is something special top scorer in the league marco played his part with 26 goals\\n\\ngyeongnam will now feature in the champions league for the first time i thought that seems to have put the brakes on too many of their players departing but captain choi youngjun signed for jeonbuk in the winter transfer window a major loss is marco who was also top scorer in k league 2 in the year they were promoted who appears to have followed the money to china also off to china is key centreback park jisoo so basically the backbone of the team from defence to attack has left\\n\\nulsan hyundai\\n\\nknown as the horangi   the tigers  ulsan have had intermittent success in asia winning the champions league for the first and only time in 2012 in an unbeaten run\\n\\ntowards the end of the 2018 season ulsan were battling gyeongnam for the second spot which brings with it direct qualification to the champions league group stages rather than having a playoff they lost out but were widely expected to secure a direct qualification spot anyway when they faced daegu fc in the fa cup final ultimately they finished the season on a low losing 51 on aggregate to daegu in the final \\n\\npohang steelers\\n\\none of the few clubs that predates the formation of the k league pohang are another of the historical korean powerhouses they hold the record for the most number of champions league title 3 but their last title came in 2009\\n\\nfinishing fourth in the league they were hoping that ulsan would beat daegu in the fa cup final to pass their champions league spot on down but it didnt happen\\n\\njeju united\\n\\none of the original members of the k league founded as the yukong elephants in the seoul area as part of the decentralisation program they moved to bucheon kind of and were renamed as bucheon sk the decision to move to jeju in 2006 was an abrupt one and understandably deeply unpopular with the fans teams uprooting and moving elsewhere is a bit of a catalyst for the creation of new teams in korea and the fans formed bucheon fc 1995 in the absence of bucheon sk\\n\\nthe reason given for the relocation was to the address the imbalance in football teams being located around seoulgyeonggido and jeju did not have a pro team at the time but there are suggestions the owners sk group wanted to cut their investment and recoup some costs\\n\\nthere were recent rumours that jeju would move yet again back north to yongin but who knows \\n\\njeju had a pretty mediocre season what more can i say\\n\\nsuwon samsung bluewings\\n\\nsuwons 2018 season was a bit bonkers and especially so in their champions league run\\n\\nin their champions league group in which they were drawn with eventual winners kashima antlers suwon did not manage a single home win however they had managed to get two away wins and going into the final match they still had their fate in their own hands if they could win against group leaders kashima in japan they won 10 getting three away wins and topping the group\\n\\nmanager seo jungwon at a time when suwon were 4th in the league resigned the day before the first leg of their champions league quarterfinal clash with jeonbuk due to fan protests jeonbuk were apparently completely bamboozled by this event and took a 30 beating at home then in the return leg in suwon jeonbuk fought back to win 30 but suwon were able to scrape through on penalties to face kashima antlers yet again in the semis\\n\\nin the semifinal fixture suwon went 20 up against kashima antlers inside the first 10 minutes but went on to lose 32 in the first leg\\nsoon after manager seo returned as suddenly as he had departed having been gone for just 6 weeks  \\nin the second leg suwon went a goal down in the first half but came back with 3 in the second half to be on their way to the final after 60 mins played however kashima antlers fought back to get two more goals and win 65 on aggregate and would go on to win the final if you want to relive a part of that rollercoaster night here you gohttpsyoutuberxy8pagy1aq and heres an idea of the atmosphere that nighthttpstwittercomtheafcclstatus1055055104607285248\\n\\nat one point it looked like they might qualify for the champions league again for the 2019 season but suwon didnt win any of their final five league matches and dropped to 6th\\n\\nmanager seo left again at the end of the season and will manage japans sagan tosu recently captain kim eunsun was released from the club for drinkdriving the drama just never ends\\n\\ndaegu fc\\n\\nprior to the world cup daegu were languishing at the bottom of the table but after the return they found some kind of consistent form helped out by world cup hero goalkeeper jo hyeonwoo they really peaked at the right time as daegu made it to the fa cup final and against the odds defeated ulsan hyundai 51 on aggregate meaning for the first time they will feature in the champions league this is no mean feat for team whose best ever finish in the top flight is 7th place if they carry over their momentum into the 2019 season the year could be one of their most successful ever they will also be playing in a new footballspecific stadium this year\\n\\ngangwon fc\\n\\ngangwon are a fairly midbottom team i dont really know what to say about them they did have the 2ndhighest top scorer in the 2018 season though bosnian uros deric they also had the worst colour scheme in the league last season their kit is slightly improved this season\\n\\nincheon united\\n\\ni always like to imagine that incheon chose their strip so that they could be the inter to fc seouls ac milan they even have a nickname nerazzurri another nickname is the durumi    the cranes\\n\\nincheon spent most of the 2018 season at the very bottom of table and had the jointleakiest defence in the league they brought in norwegian manager jrn andersen midway through the season to turn their fortunes around but even after that they were on the wrong end or the biggest thrashing of the season 70 against gangwon coming into the end of the season though they were playing really nice attacking football even if they didnt always get the result at the split they were still bottom but won 4 out of 5 games to pull themselves up 3 places\\n\\nit was in attack that incheon shone montenegrin stefan mugosa was their top scorer in his debut season moon seonmin with the best goal celebration in the league also put in a strong performance but has now signed for champions jeonbuk nam junjae returned in the summer to score some bangers costa rican international aguilar was also impressive but has signed for jeju in the new season\\n\\nsangju sangmu\\n\\nthe military team where other k league players get loaned to to complete their military service their history goes far back in one sense as various military teams were playing way back to the 50s but they were founded for pro footballers to serve their time only in 1984 although they were for pro players they competed in the semipro national league until 2003 when they joined the k league based in gwangju when gwangju fc were formed they moved to sangju\\n\\nsangju sangmu do not have any foreign players for obvious reasons and cannot compete in the champions league although the chances of ever finishing in a qualifying spot are fairly slim\\n\\nfc seoul\\n\\nfc seoul wow what happened having won the league in 2016 albeit somewhat fortuitously and always finishing in the top half if not competing for the title in the past decade nobody expected seoul to be fighting against relegation although relatively solid defensively they scored the least number of goals in the league season of all teams their star foreign players almost all left before the season started including dejan to rivals suwon and were not replaced with the same quality and for many matches seoul played with an allkorean team one bit of good news for the future is that former captain osmar will return from his loan to cezero osaka for the new season\\n\\nseoul at least managed to avoid relegation by beating busan ipark over two legs in the playoff helped by a red card in the first leg surprisingly they managed to score 3 goals in the first leg in open play\\n\\nseoul is probably the most popular club in korea im sure helped by the fact that it is the main club in a city of 10 million people  seoul generally has the highest game attendances although it was much reduced last season because they were so crap\\n\\nstarting out as luckygoldstar ie lg fc in chungcheong province the team was permitted to relocate to seoul at the start of the 90s and were renamed as lg cheetahs during the decentralisation period they moved to anyang modifying their name to anyang lg cheetahs after the world cup the team successfully negotiated a move back to seoul and did away with their cheetahs moniker taking their current name fc seoul their founding and rebirth years are both on their badge  1983 and 2004\\n\\nseongnam fc\\n\\ngaining direct promotion due to asan mugunghwas situation seongnam is actually the most decorated team in korea\\n\\nfounded in 1989 in seoul as ilhwa chunma they were forced out of seoul and settled in cheonnan for a period in 2000 they moved to seongnam a satellite city of seoul and appended the city name to the name of the club seongnams title drought started when the head of the owner company that backed seongnam died in 2012 and the board were keen to let go of the club seongnam city government took over ownership of the club for the 2014 season and they were renamed seongnam fc seongnam are now back in k league 1 after a 2 year absence\\n\\nk league 2 clubs\\n\\nby last seasons standings\\n\\njeonnam dragons\\n\\njeonbuks jeolla province rivals they

transfer window activity\\n\\nfrom a monetary point of view korea is the biggest net exporterhttpsenynacokrviewaen20190131006600315sectionsportsindex of players in asia in the transfer market this winter window was no different with what i would say were the two biggest stories involving young homegrown korean talent going abroad\\n\\nthe first is that of jeonbuk and national team star centreback kim minjae nicknamed the monster there were rumours of an offer from english side watford but it wasnt clear if there ever was any offer or negotiations  kim himself said he did not know of any interest from watford it doesnt really matter now  kim signed with chinese side beijing sinobo guoan and will see champions league football with them in the new season being drawn in the same group as jeonbuk\\n\\nthe second is hwang inbeom who has signed for mls side vancouver whitecaps hwang inbeom played in k league 2 last season with asan mugunghwa and daejeon citizen but has impressed as a midfield playmaker and is currently seen as a replacement for ki sungyueng in the national team\\n\\nfor a recognisable name for western readers the best i have is englishman jordon mutch who signed for gyeongnam from crystal palace resulting in this awkward photo ophttpspbstwimgcommediadzg3adzvyaakrkqformatjpgnamemedium another recognisable name is mix diskerud on loan to ulsan from man city but he joined the previous year\\n\\nk league 1s top scorer marco left gyeongnam for hebei china fortune and his replacement is luc castaignos signed from sporting cp his stats in europe havent been great in recent years but he may fare better in korea\\n\\nthere were of course a few hundred domestic internal transfers and number of other foreign player signings  if you want the full list k league uniteds winter transfer trackerhttpwwwkleagueunitedcom2019012019kleaguewintertransfertrackerhtml has it all\\n\\n\\n\\nhistory of club football in korea  establishment of the k league\\n\\nassociation football was first introduced to korea in 1882 when british royal navy crew harboured at incheon played a game it wasnt until the 1900s that football began to take hold and the first public match was played in 1905 there was a boom in in the 1910s with a number of football clubs being formed and rivalries began to form between clubs in seoul and pyongyang\\n\\nthe first nationwide competition was the all joseon football tournament joseon being the name for korea at the time founded in 1921 there wasnt actually a champion crowned in 1921 as the tournament was cut short due to complaints over refereeing decisions all this was taking place during japanese occupation of korea during most of the first half of the 20th century\\n\\naccording to the kfahttpswebarchiveorgweb20170606162658httpkfaorkrrecordhistoryasp football was the only tonic that could relieve the the national resentment that had accumlated in the hearts as a colony under the japanese empire and was a sprout that could foster the hope of freedom a tad hyperbolic maybe\\n\\none side effect of being a japanese colony is that some korean teams were allowed to participate in the emperors cup japans fa cup and in 1935 kyungsung fc kyungsung was a name for seoul during japanese occupation won the tournament becoming the only nonjapanese team to ever do so\\n\\nthe all joseon football tournament ran until wwii\\n\\nafter wwii came korean independence and shortly thereafter the korean war there was football being played during this period continuously when possible the korean national semiprofessional football league was founded in 1964 and is the predecessor to todays tier 3 national league many of the teams during this period were works teams  employed by a company playing under the name of the company but also having a proper job in the company cha bumkun said by some to be the greatest ever asian footballer rose to fame during this period albeit mainly in the bundesliga starting his senior career at the mighty seoul trust bank fc the most astonishing statistic about cha bumkun is he only received one yellow card in his career\\n\\nfinally we get to the establishment of professional football with the korean super league in 1983 now named the k league initially there were only 5 teams and 2 of those teams dropped out within 2 years the number of clubs in the top flight has varied from the initial 5 to a high of 16 in 2011 in 2013 the k league split into two tiers now k league 1 and k league 2\\n\\nfor the first few years of the k league teams did not have a fixed home stadium that they played in because there was no standard homeaway format that we are so familiar with today instead it was operated as a national tour\\n\\nthe k league in the modern era has its own history but one of the most interesting events was the forced exodus of all three clubs from seoul in 1996 as part of a policy to spread the popularity of football around the country also with an eye on stadium infrastructure for the 2002 world cup two of the clubs didnt move far only just outside the city of seoul each to one of seouls satellite cities yukong elephants only halfleft because the city they moved to didnt have a stadium yet so they continued to play in seoul until a new stadium was built for a number of years the k league was without any seoul representation in 2004 after the need to find someone to fill a great big national football stadium and help pay towards it one of those relocated teams moved back to seoul becoming fc seoul\\n\\n\\n\\nfootball pyramid  league format\\n\\nthe current system looks like this\\n\\n\\n tier  league  notes \\n\\n 1  k league 1 12 teams 1 relegation to k league 2 1 relegation playoff with k league 2\\n 2  k league 2  10 teams 1 promotion to k league 1 1 promotion playoff with k league 2\\n 3  national league  8 teams semipro no promotionrelegation\\n 4  k3 league advanced  12 teams semiproamateur 2 relegations to k3 league basic 1 relegation playoff with k3 league basic \\n 5  k3 league basic 11 teams semiproamateur 2 promotions to k3 league advanced 1 promotion playoff with k3 league advanced \\n 6 division 5 league 6 regional leagues with 52 teams some relegation to division 6 \\n 7  division 6 league 26 regional leagues with 174 teams some prorel with divisions 5  7 \\n 8  division 7 league 160 regional leagues with 960 teams some promotion with division 6 \\n\\nas you can see the naming is completely screwed up  k3 league occupies tiers 4 and 5 and division 5 is in tier 6 this is probably because the top tier k league only split in two in 2013 with the creation on k league 2 and nobodys been bothered to update their names\\n\\nthe national league sits stubbornly in tier 3 blocking any continuous prorel the powers that be have regularly stated that they want to reform the pyramid to have a continuous route from top to bottom at least to the bottom of k3 league within a few years but for some reason its not happening the winners of the 2006 national league season were offered promotion to the k league but they declined the offer the winners of the 2007 season were also offered promotion but declined again even though they said they would like promotion at the start of the season\\n\\none of the more recent additions to the k league bucheon fc 1995 joined from k3 league because they didnt want to pay the higher fees associated with starting out in the national league\\n\\noutside of this system there is the wk league the womens top tier the wk league has been dominated by incheon red angels no connection to incheon united in recent years theres no womens champions league in asia yet but for a few years in the past the winners of the wk league played the winners of japans nadeshiko league for a little more info on the wk league see this reddit posthttpswwwredditcomrwomenssoccercommentsaqkew5southkoreasroutetotheworldcupthewkleague\\n\\nalso worth a mention is the separate u league for universities and colleges some of the teams from which enter into the korean fa cup the route into a pro team in korea is often direct from high school or university teams something i dont think exists in europe some high school teams are even seen as feeder teams for a particular pro team i wont pretend to understand how the system works but ill leave you with the tidbit that park jisung was first signed to a professional team from a university team almost by accident as the scout had come to see a different player but took home park instead\\n\\nk league 1\\n\\nk league 1 consists of 12 teams playing 38 games the format is identical to the scottish premiership  all teams play each other three times and then after the split the top 6 and bottom 6 battle it out among themselves to settle the championship and relegation spots respectively the first tie breaker for teams level on points is goals scored rather than goal difference\\n\\nthe top 3 places offer a chance in the afc champions league the fourth champions league spot going to the winner of the korean fa cup bottom place gets relegated to k league 2 whilst 11th place has a playoff with one of the teams that finished 2nd4th in k league 2\\n\\ninternational context\\n\\nin the current format of the afc champions league the competition is split into a west region think uae saudi arabia qatar iran and an east region the east region is dominated by three nations  korea china and japan australia who decided it wanted to be asian earlier this century has also had a bit of success\\n\\nthis year there will be two debutants from korea  gyeongnam fc and daegu fc its dufficult to predict how well these two will fare but if they can carry some form over to this year they could get out of the group stages at least\\n\\ndetermining who has the strongest teams amongst the big three east asian nations is a difficult task and is hugely subjective im almost i say almost because obviously k league is best league of the opinion that theyre as close to equal as makes no difference korea has the most number of titles and the club with the most titles pohang steelers china have the highest coefficient japan has won the past two tournaments\\n\\nin recent years china and japan have had a number of big star foreigner signings eg paulinho torres which are absent from the k league i believe this is due to japan having cash mainly coming from tv money and china having cash from well being china despite korea lagging financially all three nations have the same limit on foreign players three foreigners plus one from another afc country and so korean teams are still competitive due to the relative strength of their domestic players\\n\\nwhile were on the topic of the champions league each of the big three east asian nations get 4 places total  2 or 3 to the group stages and 1 or 2 to the last qualifying playoff round before the group stages this playoff round is massively weighted in the big threes favour as they have to win just one home game when the weather is still genrally freezing cold against a team from a nation with a tropical climate i dont know of a korean club ever losing this playoff match\\n\\nthe afc cup is sometimes said to be the equivalent of uefas europa league but its not really comparable the afc cup is for the weaker asian nations only and korea arent allowed to enter\\n\\n\\n\\nresources\\n\\nwebsites  podcasts\\n\\nfor those of us who are linguistically challenged heres how you can follow k league in english\\n\\none of the best websites for news match previews and analysis is k league unitedhttpwwwkleagueunitedcom it covers everything  k league 1  2 fa cup transfer news national team and more it also has a podcast if youre into that sort of thing\\n\\na really good resource for uptodate breaking news is an english version of a korean news outlet the sports category of yonhap newshttpsenynacokrsportsindex for example is great although youll be getting other sports news in there such as korean baseball football appears pretty regularly also the team that works on writing the articles dont seem to work weekends\\n\\ntavern of the taeguk warriorshttpwwwtaegukwarriorscom has a lot of information mainly on the korean national team and tracks the progress of koreans playing in europe but covers the domestic club scene now and then\\n\\n48 shades of footballhttps48shadesblogcom is a great english language podcast following korean football\\n\\nthe asian gamehttpswwwtheasiangamenet is another great english language podcast that doesnt specifically follow korean football but since they cover asian football theyll sometimes have indepth coverage of the korean clubs competing in the afc champions league as well as the korean national team\\n\\nfor your twitter fix the korea football news korfootballnewshttpstwittercomkorfootballnews and viva la kleague kleagueno1httpstwittercomkleagueno1 twitter feeds are pretty quick with breaking news in english \\n\\nthere is also the official k league websitehttpwwwkleaguecom which can be viewed in english but i think unless you live in korea its going to be painfully slow to use\\n\\nthen of course theres rkleague with news and discussion and where you can ask questions to the community\\n\\nhighlights  watching live\\n\\nall highlights from k league 1 matches are uploaded fairly promptly to the spotv youtube channelhttpswwwyoutubecomuserspotv spotv is a korean sports broadcaster they also upload content from the kbo baseball and the v league volleyball so youll have to scroll down until you see something saying k1 it helps if you know how korean letters sound phonetically to understand which teams are playing but you can also see which match a video is from the crests in the thumbnail the commentary will be in korean but each video is really good quality typically about 10 minutes long\\n\\nif you watch to watch live the good news is that is very easy and basically free i have no idea whether any national broadcasters or streaming services around the world have k league rights but in korea itself essentially every thing is streamed on korean online behemoth navers platform the one caveat is that live streams are region locked so to access them youll need a vpn to get a korean ip address although some other asian countries also seem to have access i wont repeat what others have already written so heres a short guide to getting it workinghttpswwwredditcomrkleaguecomments7a3zpwkleaguetipsfordummies3icantwaittoget which also covers another route via the daum online portal or theres a comment in that thread which covers a more straightforward way by using the naver tv app\\n\\nthe kfa youtube channelhttpswwwyoutubecomuserkfatvcom has a bunch of nonk league highlights including the fa cup k3 and wk league highlights\\n\\nthe k league website also has plenty of highlights but again outside of korea it might be buffering for a long time'}, {'title': 'traveling to south korea where

the covid19 virus from the diseases epicenter in daegu it has given itself four weeks to stabilize the situation in the city of 25 million some 150 miles southeast of the capital seoul\\n\\nif authorities fail to contain the spread of the covid19 in daegu there is a high possibility that covid19 could spread nationwide vice health minister kim ganglip toldhttpwwwkoreaheraldcomviewphpud20200224000754np1mp1 reporters on monday\\n\\nmost of south koreas 833 cases as of monday are in daegu and most are connected to an obscure religious group called the shincheonji church of jesus\\n\\ncase numbers doubled for several days in a row last week the virus spread to every major city and province in the country as a result the government on sunday raised the countrys virus alert level to red its highest for the first time since 2009 this gave authorities the power to shut down schools and restrict flights in and out of the country it also advised all citizens showing symptoms of respiratory ailments or fever to stay away from work and school and to selfquarantine\\n\\nits not clear how many south koreans will heed that advice and its highly unlikely that the government could impose draconian restrictions locking down entire cities as in the case of china says kim woojoo a doctor in the department of infectious disease at korea universitys guro hospital in seoul\\n\\nsouth korea is a liberal democracy with the freedom of movement he says besides he says any lockdown now would already be too late since daegu is a transport hub through which many people have already passed\\n\\nthe government and health authorities response has always been one step behind he adds\\n\\nwhile neighboring japan has expanded its ban on travelers from chinas hubei province to include eastern zhejiang province for example south korea has not followed suit more than half a million people petitionedhttpswwwreuterscomarticleuschinahealthreactionsouthkoreasouthkoreanscallinpetitionforchinesetobebarredovervirusiduskbn1zr0qj south koreas presidential office last month to ban all visitors from china but seoul has balked apparently for economic and diplomatic reasons\\n\\ndespite the surge in case numbers kim does not believe the current situation warrants panic or despair he points out that south koreas wellregarded national health system has a solid track record of containing epidemics including sars severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 h1n1 in 2009 and mers middle east respiratory syndrome in 2015\\n\\none reason case numbers appear to have grown rapidly is because of the countrys ability to test large numbers of people quickly as of monday afternoon the health authorities had testedhttpswwwcdcgokrboardboardesmida20501000000bid0015listno366327actview 31923 people with 20292 tests coming back negative and 11631 results still pending\\n\\nother countries that claim they have no cases kim says may actually lack the ability to detect them\\n\\nif the government medical system and the people of south korea organize the resources we have well and cooperate then we can fully defeat this outbreak and it will eventually come to an end he says\\n\\nhealth authorities are also focusing resources on the shincheonji church of jesus founded in 1984 by charismatic pastor lee manhee whose followers estimated at up to 240000 worldwide believe he is the messiah shincheonji is korean for new heaven and earth its critics say its a cult\\n\\nauthorities are not sure how the disease was first transmitted to the group but investigators have been looking into it more than 9000 shincheonji members have been put under quarantine and the government planshttpworldkbscokrservicenewsviewhtmlangeseqcode151557 to test all of them for the virus\\n\\ncritics say the disease may have spread within the church quickly because of the way that it worships shincheonji followers hold services sitting on the floor without any chairs packed together like bean sprouts says shin hyunuk director of the guri cult counseling center an organization in gyeonggi province that works to extract members from the church shin was a member of the shincheonji group for 20 years managing the churchs bible study instructors until 2006\\n\\na bigger problem is that they shout out amen after every sentence the pastor utters pretty much every few seconds and they do that at the top of their lungs sending respiratory droplets flying everywhere he adds these droplets are believed to transmit the coronavirus\\n\\nhe says that group members proselytize in secret without revealing their identity this is because many koreans are wary of the group and its reputation as a result this makes it difficult for people who may have been targeted to know whether theyve been in contact with a member of the sect because shincheonji members cannot reveal themselves they make it impossible for others to be cautious and selfquarantine themselves\\n\\ncritics allege that the church obstructed the coronavirus investigation by not cooperating with health

immersing in the environment around and not looking so much like a tourist that being said this is my first trip abroad so i dont really know what to expect or know how my comfort level will be when

satellite city this is obviously not a comprehensive list and there are probably better deals elsewhere \\n\\nbasic information\\n\\nopening hours unless otherwise specified all stores are open every day at the stated hours \\n\\nprice all prices will be in korean won krw or just won usd1 is worth roughly krw1100 to krw1150 depending on whats affecting the markets also all prices here already have 10 vat included in them there is no way around this even for foreign tourists for those of you familiar with the japanese yen jpy100 is worth krw1000 to krw1050\\n\\nthe stores listed here generally fall under two categories with the exception of anitong and hobby factory for reasons mentioned further in the guide\\n\\n1\\tgundam base\\n2\\tthird party general hobby shop with a sizable gunpla section\\n\\ngundam base \\n\\ngundam base is a chain of retailers run by bandai korea primarily specializing in gunpla but also stocking a handful of other models made by bandai\\n\\nall branches have a bunch of different gunpla put together to show shoppers what the final gunpla would look like they arent completely painted and all that  just a straight build and decals \\n\\nfurthermore gundam base carries some basic tools to get you started on not just building but also some painting and panel lining they carry different cans of finishers gundam markers sandpaper and tools nothing too esoteric but imo just enough to give the curious a taste of what its like to paint or panel line without having to invest heavily from the getgo \\n\\nhowever the gundam base chain is on the more expensive side of the lot  only toys r us and the korean equivalent of  target namely emart home plus and lotte mart charge more but their selections are on the small side to begin with anyway and i wont cover them gb calculates the korean retail price by taking the japanese retail price and multiplying it by 12 but in comparison thirdparty retailers multiply the japanese prices by 10 instead using the mg zz gundam ver ka as an example it costs 72000 won at gb but hobby factory mentioned down below has it for around 54000 won using pg strike rouge  skygrasper package gb has it for 228000 won while hf has it for 171000 won\\n\\nthat said gundam base is home to limited editions exclusive to gb like the mg rx782 30 clear color the boxes for these models have a unique white border like thishttpkradmingundaminfouploadeditor20170818180035pvqyqexhjpg that along with the general convenience of the locations may make gundam base a onestop shop worth the price hike but thats relative\\n\\nthirdparty hobby shops \\n\\nthe next group is pretty selfexplanatory you have gunpla as well as other model kits like reallife military hardware and vessels and a pretty comprehensive amount of tools and paint gunpla prices here are slightly cheaper than gundam base whereas gundam base takes the japanese retail price and multiplies it by 12 these stores as well as other thirdparty retailers take the japanese retail price and multiply it by 10 depending on the store gunpla takes up anywhere between 15 to 14 of the total store space \\n\\ni will list stores sorted by seoul subway

than a gunplaspecific one this also means that their general tool lineup is far more comprehensive than that of gundam base so if you would like to pick up some nippers or other things that you can still carry back home it may be worth a visit \\n\\ni noticed that this shop is filled with tools branded style x and it turns out that style x is a brand created by this hobby store i cannot comment

down with a small first floor as the cashier and area for miniatures and some tools followed by a much larger basement filled with gunpla of all grades and then followed by a smaller basement level for those larger character figurines one interesting thing about this store is that you need to check your bags with the staff  apparently the store experienced numerous thefts so if youre going into the basement you need to drop your bags off these guys also determine prices by multiplying the japanese retail price with 10\\n\\njoyhobby closed\\n\\nhapjeong line 2 238 line 6 622\\n\\na newly

some cases up to twice as much as retail i found a hguc rx782 real type ver its yen tag says 1200 but the seller asked 25000 krw for it the selection is totally random and the owner does not maintain

their words not mine and after visiting it once i think they live up to the name there are gunpla other plastic models even 1100 hasegawa virtual on force models as of this post tools manga books and more \\n\\non an aside they have a tv that plays opening scenes of different anime \\n\\nmore relevant to this guide gunpla makes up about 12 to 13 of the store there are also paints and tools for sale though i think their selection is smaller than joyhobbys \\n\\nprices here may be the cheapest you can get offline on a regular basis random sales notwithstanding the prices for gunpla here are set at 9 times the japanese retail price so using the zz ver ka again the japanese retail price is 6000 yen most of the thirdparty retailers mentioned here sell it for 60000 won if there is stock anitong sells it at 54000 won \\n\\nthat said i noticed they have more hg and sd kits on display compared to the other grades it seems like at gundam base the space is divided mostly equally for each grade probably with the exception for pg and whatever extras they have are kept in storage but at anitong i saw columns and columns of sd and hg kits with lesser numbers of mg kits  \\n\\nfurthermore anitong holds random sales for their lineup slashing prices by upwards of 20 at times however some of these sales are available only to members of their frequent buyer program \\n\\nheres another store that also sells a handful of pbandai kits at higher prices just a couple cabinets worth though so dont make this store your goto for limited kits \\n\\neuljiro 1ga line 2 202\\n\\nwelcome to myeongdong a large shopping district with goods of all price ranges from street stalls selling cheap trinkets to the likes of uniqlo and hm to midrange goods like nike to highend luxury goods there is a gundam base in this neighborhood within the lotte department store or more precisely lotte young plaza as listed below \\n\\ngundam base   \\n\\nopening hours 1130am930pm identical to mall hours closed every second or third monday of the month  there doesnt seem to be a specific pattern\\n\\nkorean address    67 1 \\n\\nlocation lotte young plaza b1 after you get off the subway and pass the turnstile head over to exits 7 and 8 you can get to gb a couple of ways get out via exit 7 walk down the street with the road on your left until you see lotte young plaza on the right enter and look for an escalator going downor you can navigate the shopping mall to get to gb \\n\\nthis is the least confusing and most straightforward as the store layout isnt exactly the easiest to understand that said if the weather isnt great there are staff members here who are likely to understand english or mandarin chinese so they may be able to help you navigate your way \\n\\nthis is just like any other gundam base mentioned so far there is one difference though in that besides the gbexclusive kits they also have a few limited item and expo kits on sale at their original prices\\n\\nsuwon line 1 p155 bundang line k245\\n\\nthis section is made possible with the help of ucmndjernavy who visited korea for a while and stayed relatively near this branch thanks a lot man\\n\\nsuwon is a satellite city located about an hour or two southwest of seoul there are about a couple of historical sites in the area as well as one gundam base \\n\\ngundam base   \\n\\nopening hours 1030am to 1000pm\\n\\nlocation ak plaza 5f this is a department store chain like lotte mentioned above and this too is conveniently connected directly to the station \\n\\nkorean address    1 924 ak 5\\n\\nsame as all other branches possibly on the slightly bigger side there is also a tamiya store nearby \\n\\n quick itineraries \\n\\ngiven how the stores are not exactly clumped in one part of seoul and i very much doubt gunpla enthusiasts would visit korea for gunpla when japan is right there here are a couple of quick itineraries that will minimize travel give you as much gunpla as possible and hopefully keep your shopping to one afternoon unless youre looking for a specific kit\\n\\n\\tsoutheast seoul gangnam area gundam base gangnam and the two stores at kukje electronic center\\n\\tnorthwestcentral seoul hongik university area gundam base and hobby factory \\n\\n for expat hobbyists \\n\\ni have clumped additional frequent buyer and pbandai info here because the only way for anyone to take advantage of this is to have a korean cellphone number not to mention some degree of korean fluency  these are needed to register yourself online for the buyer program this might make it difficult for shortterm tourists and other visitors to take advantage of so i figure longerterm residents  usfk united states forces korea students employees spouses basically anyone staying for at least one year  would be more interested in this section\\n\\nfrequent buyer  cashback programs \\n\\njust about every store mentioned here and countless more online have some kind of cashback or mileage program where a certain percentage of your total purchase is saved and then can be used as store credit to fund your next purchase in terms of percentage gundam base anitong and hobby factory have the largest percentage figure at 5 though if you order gunpla from bandais online mall that jumps to 10 joyhobbys and asem hobbys are the lowest at 1 with the exception of anitong the store credit does have an expiration date of 1 year from the date of purchase which means that if you bought something in june july and august the points you got from your june purchase will expire next june while the remainder will expire in the following months afterwards \\n\\ngundam base exclusive perks \\n\\nbesides the store credit program gundam basebandai namco has a member ranking and stamp card system card image here httpkradmingundaminfouploadeditorvbslslidbgmazeknsgltjpg   the image is outdated because theres no stamp section for misc 1100 when you buy a gunpla you get a physical card on which the employee adds stamps equivalent to the number of kits you bought according to grade these stamps do not expire but if you lose the card youre out of luck \\n\\ngundam base also does doublestamp deals in two cases holidays namely seol  lunar new year which falls around january or february chuseok  autumn harvest which falls around september christmas summer and winter school vacations and the first weekend following the release of a new kit just for those kits \\n\\nwhen you fill up the hg rg misc 1100 and mg stamp cards halfway you get the following no midway bonuses for sd and pg\\n\\n\\thg single gundam marker\\n\\trg action base 2 black\\n\\t1100 and mg action base 1 black\\n\\nwhen you fill one grades card up completely you get to trade the card for a kit of your choice of that grade up to a certain value filling the pg card will let you get any gunpla of any grade up to a certain price \\n\\nnow how is that value determined this is where the ranking system comes into play depending on how much money you spend at gundam base offline or online for one year as of this guides publication between 212019 and 1312020 youre ranked from top to bottom diamond gold silver bronze or ng pun intended their servers compile your total purchases and rank you and the rank is good for the next year from 212020 the minimum expenditures are as follows\\n\\n\\tng less than krw200000\\n\\tbronze krw200000\\n\\tsilver krw800000\\n\\tgold krw1600000\\n\\tdiamond krw3000000\\n\\nthe card can be redeemed by any registered member of gundam base the maximum retail price limits at each rank are as follows\\n\\nsdhgrgmisc 1100mgpg\\nng bronze silverkrw 11000krw 30000krw 40000krw 40000krw 80000krw 100000\\ngoldkrw 12100krw 33000krw 44000krw

maintained this is probably because the only pg kit you can get within the price limit at any rank is the pg skygrasper krw 60000 \\n\\nat each of these ranks you get different perks mostly discount coupons useable online or offline though there are some coupons for exclusively online use \\n\\nanitong exclusive perks\\n\\nas mentioned above anitongs store credit program is on the more generous end with 5 of your total purchases being saved as credit another point for anitong is that the credit does not expire \\n\\nfurthermore anitong provides a modest 1000 won discount coupon for every 20000 won spent in cash or 40000 won spent with a credit card \\n\\nthere are also random memberexclusive sales where upwards of 30 is shaved off their prices of certain kits \\n\\n pbandai in korea\\n\\nbandai korea offers pbandai kits under a moniker called clubg preorders start usually a week or two after japanese preorders begin but unlike regions where pbandai has a presence as pbandai bandai korea gets a certain number of kits set aside for the korean market so popular kits get sold out extremely quickly on the first run once you make an order and pay for it the kits are delivered about 34 months later these kits are not eligible for discounts but you still get the cashback benefits \\n\\nbesides clubg there are the one unnamed shop and anitong i mentioned above with elevated prices as well as gundam base in euljiro1ga as i mentioned the selection is totally random\\n\\nso thats more or less my updated shopping guide for seoul korea let me know if you have questions or

player in the history of the uefa champions league making his debut for valencia against chelsea at just 18 years of age \\n\\nunlike a few members of this korean team kangin is having a good season he was nominated la liga player of the month in august having moved to mallorca from valencia and scored against his old team when they played a few weeks ago \\n\\nhe has played predominantly in the center as either a second striker or an attacking midfielder for korea and in addition to this has also played on the wings for mallorca kangin is the essential utility player every squad needs in a tournament this role has been magnified with the injury to son and the worrying lack of form among the other established forward players \\n\\nbento however said his selection of lee kangin was not intended to cover for son should the korean talisman be unable to play\\n\\nkangin was in the squad for the friendlies against costa rica and cameroon but did not play kangin has so much talent but bentos stubbornness to stick to personal favorites means he has often not been allowed to impress which has frustrated many fans who can see he has huge potential\\n\\ni always believed that as long as i played well in la liga and proved i could be an asset to the national team he bento would pick me kangin said in september i will try to prove to the coaching staff and my teammates that i can contribute a great deal to the team if i can do that i believe i will go to the world cup\\n\\nhopefully kangin will be a player to watch on the field and not just warming the bench again hes still only 21  the youngest in the squad  and has a huge future ahead of him \\n\\nif qatar isnt the tournament in which he gets to show it uscanadamexico will be his stage for sure\\n\\njung wooyoung\\n\\nhe has been a regular fixture in the national team since making his senior debut in 2015 amassing over 60 caps and is an essential piece in bentos tactical style the 2012 olympic bronzewinning midfielder will sit in front of the back four and look to break up the oppositions play and can also slot in as an extra central defender if required not one to watch for fans of fancy football\\n\\nwith kim minjae behind him who is very adept at carrying the ball forward wooyoung may be seen covering for the inform napoli man should he take the ball out from the back as bento likes this korean team to do \\n\\nhe walked off the pitch with an apparent leg injury late on in the recent iceland game but should be fine injuries have been an issue as of late unfortunately and this is expected to be his final world cup\\n\\ni had some trouble ramping back up after getting injured jung has said of his left ankle and calf injuries from june ive been trying to get back to good form and ive not wasted a single day my goal is to be even better than my peak from the past and i think i am on the right path\\n\\nwooyoung has played in qatar since joining xavis old team al sadd playing alongside the legendary spaniard and subsequently playing under him when he became manager korea will hope this opportunity to learn from one of the sports alltime greats will pay off in such a tricky group where koreas midfield really could be the key to unlocking the attacking potential held by the fastpaced forward players \\n\\nlee jaesung\\n\\nanother experienced member of the side over the years with over 60 caps to his name lee has scored twice this season for mainz in the bundesliga and has been a fairly regular fixture in the starting eleven he missed out on koreas summer friendlies through injury but is back and will look to make an impact whether as a winger or an attackminded central midfielder depending on how bento changes styles should complement hwang inbeom well \\n\\nno matter where he plays he can use his speed and stamina well his goal against werder bremen earlier this season saw him make a storming run from central midfield and left completely unchecked by the defense leaving him free to pick the ball up from a pass outside the penalty area and slot it past with ease albeit with a little help from a deflection also in his arsenal is his calmness under pressure and ability to use both feet breaking out a few stepovers or a cryuffturn to get himself out of trouble a fun one to watch\\n\\nkorea has made the most out of highintensity highstamina players before most famously the legendary park jisung with the likelihood most of their games will be spent chasing possession and waiting for an opportunity to break out lee jaesung is the perfect player for such a role as hes happy to go get the ball himself and run with it as far as he needs to before putting in a through ball to an overlapping player or going for goal himself \\n\\nhonorable mentions\\n\\njeong wooyeong spent time in the bayern munich youth setup now 23 and at freiburg where the winger has 10 goals to his name and plenty of speed to burn maybe another who gets their shot during the next cycle though\\n\\nhwang inbeom versatile central midfielder has been everpresent for olympiakos this season and is a trusted lieutenant for paulo bento having moved to the greek side after consulting with the former olympiakos boss\\n\\ncho yumin if youre watching him something has gone wrong a lastminute inclusion due to injuries yumin plays for daejeon hana citizen they are in the korean second tier though they did win the league and are being promoted to the first tier he is the only member of the squad to play in the korean second tier \\n\\n\\n\\npoints of discussion\\n\\nthe tactics  bento ball\\n\\nexbenfica and sporting manager paulo bento was appointed to lead the korean team in 2018 following their disappointing world cup campaign with a contract running through the end of the 2022 world cup he has become the longestserving head coach in the national teams history but has also proved to be one of the most controversial\\n\\nbento has been criticized for his conservative tactics his reluctance to be flexible in tactical styles and player selection and his inability to play his players in their best positions all familiar stories i am sure for portugal fans during his 4 years in charge of the seleo das quinas\\n\\nunder bentos management korea has been focused on playing it out from the back preferring a 4132 or a 4231 formation he recently experimented with a 4141 with mixedtopoor results in the friendlies against brazil chile and paraguay and the eaff tournament against hong kong and japan\\n\\nin the 10 win over iceland on november 11 bento went with a back three for the first time since september 2019\\n\\nregardless of the chosen tactic the playstyle largely remained the same keeping possession in the midfield and using sweepers to get the ball moving forward often worked against more inferior teams during south koreas world cup qualifiers but against koreas world cup group stage opponents portugal uruguay and ghana the strategy may not be so effective bento has been heavily criticized for not having a plan b \\n\\nin my opinion it doesnt make sense to change our style its much worse in my opinion for us to play differently in a way that were not used to because if we dont have time to correct certain things its almost impossible to make too much of a difference  paulo bento\\n\\nin the disappointing 00 draw with iraq during qualifying forward players were often isolated when the midfield got pressed and manmarked bento then insisted on repeating the same patterns of attack relying heavily on wingbacks to try and spread the play to the lesscrowded areas of the pitch but iraq did not take long to figure out the game plan and block them\\n\\nagainst highpressing teams korea has often been outplayed and overwhelmed notably in the 51 friendly loss to brazil who dominated the press marked son out of the game and kept korea off the ball to claim almost 60 total possession the chastening 30 friendly loss to japan last year almost cost bento his job as japan pressed korea out of the game korea was unable to create passing lanes forward and the lone striker in the 4141 was isolated and ineffectual \\n\\ni admit that things didnt work out the way we intended them to in the first half we only ended up passing the ball around the middle of the field we only got a little better at it in the second half  paulo bento after the defeat to japan\\n\\nwhen it works it works well and korea has plenty of versatile attacking options but the worry is that teams can figure out their gameplan quickly and bento isnt good enough  or even willing  to find a fix this leads us to the next talking point\\n\\nthe players  versatile unbalanced and out of form\\n\\nbefore the qatar world cup there is a long way to go and there are too many homework assignments to solve the two puzzles of players and tactics when someone has a problem i dont see a player who can fill it  park moonsung commentator\\n\\nits no secret that last seasons premier league golden boot winner son is the star of this team to call korea a oneman team is unfair but it does merit some discussion \\n\\nearlier this year bento was forced to take a squad of only domesticbased players to the east asian football federation championship the tournament fell outside the official fifa calendar so many clubs did not release their star players leaving the likes of son and kim minjae unavailable korea met expectations by dispatching hong kong and china 30 each but then in their final game against japan fell 30 themselves and recorded a dismal one shot on target\\n\\nthe tournament was meant to be an audition for those domestic league players looking to stake their claim for a spot on the final world cup roster which would need this domestic depth to complement the core overseas players the final squad has 12 players who are signed to clubs outside of korea including two in the bundesliga and three in the premier league\\n\\nbut the loss to japan exposed south koreas worrisome lack of depth and together with the mixed friendly results particularly the 10 win over iceland with a koreanbased team only shows that many korean players may have a lack of experience against top opposition both domestically and internationally\\n\\nmaking things worse is that this overseas core has been struggling this season hwang heechan has not been struggling at wolves and hwang uijo has been making cameo appearances on loan for olympiakos since making the move from bordeaux to nottingham forest if goals are to be scored these players need to leave their club form behind and switch up the gears for their country especially now because the one man expected to lead this time by himself if needed is now a doubt  and who admittedly has not been having a great domestic season himself even before the injury\\n\\nin koreas favor is that kim minjae is having an outstanding season for napoli and there is plenty of young attacking talent ready to show up and show off if given the chance the worry is though like many teams that if the core isnt performing or has an injury problem can the backups really be counted on when it matters\\n\\nthe injury  risk and reward\\n\\nthe unthinkable happened son was injured playing for spurs against marseille just weeks before the world cup sustaining a fractured eye socket which required surgery this injury has thrown a huge wrench in koreas world cup preparations so close to the tournament \\n\\nweve been informed by tottenham that son heungmin had completed a successful procedure but since the surgery just took place its too early at this point to discuss his status for the world cup the national teams medical staff has remained in contact with tottenham regarding sons injury  statement from the korean football association\\n\\nson is a warrior having played with a fractured arm before it didnt seem to have a big impact on his form however this injury is very different of course\\n\\nbeing an aerial threat and scoring headers has never really been a focal part of his game his pace and technical skills on his feet have always been his strongest points and this injury is unlikely to stop him from being able to replicate this kind of play\\n\\nplayers going to a major tournament while injured is nothing new wayne rooney was in the england squad for the 2006 world cup despite his broken metatarsal he returned to action within six weeks of suffering the injury only missing out on englands opening game \\n\\nothers have played through facial injuries before notably kevin de bruyne he fractured his eye socket in the 2021 champions league final but within three weeks he was masked up and playing for belgium at the euros\\n\\nthe question is then how much of a role on the field can he play\\n\\nhe might sit out the opener or at least come off the bench to get a feel for things if hes able no doubt hes raring to go he needs just one goal to surpass the record of koreas alltime top scorer at world cups ahn junghwan and park jisung are currently tied with him as the recordholders with 3 goals \\n\\nshould son not be able to play its still a great benefit to bring him along as part of the squad he embodies korean football and can be an inspiring presence in the dressing room just as much as he could be out on the field\\n\\nwe are in contact with him with the tottenham medical department but about the exact time the exact day he can train with the team we dont have that information yet  bento\\n\\nsuwon samsung bluewings forward oh hyeongyu is also travelling with the team to qatar as a reserve player as cover for son \\n\\nhe may get his chance  even if not for son hwang heechan missed the first training session at the time of writing with what team officials have described as left hamstring discomfort fullback kim jinsu has also been battling a hamstring problem he didnt take part in any team sessions only doing individual workouts \\n\\nexpectation\\n\\nsouth koreas first group h match against uruguay is on november 24th the taegeuk warriors will then face ghana on november 28th and portugal on december 2nd all three matches will be played at the education city stadium in al rayyan west of doha\\n\\nhopefully son is able to take part despite his injury an expectation shared by the players would be korea progressing to the round of 16\\n\\nwe want to take this one match at a time and reach the round of 16 i am sure everyone on the team understands what we should do to get to that point  kim younggwon\\n\\nbut the numbers dont lie with opta crunching the numbers and giving korea an 82 chance to make the last

'angry soccer fans call for firing worldclass con man jrgen klinsmann and kfa head and jaebol boss chung mongkyu they later modify demands to call for klinsmanns deportation and ask song heungmins father to take over the national team', 'selftext': 'hecklers and protestors were gathered earlier today to call for the firing of south koreas national soccer coach jrgen klinsmann and the head of the korean football association chung mongkyu  later they changed their demands and called for klinsmanns deportation  we dont want him to set his foot on the korean soil again  the only problem however is that klinsmann is already back in his adopted home country  in newport beach in the california republik  what they probably mean is that they want klinsmann to be declared a persona non grata  this is the step south korea takes to its own citizens that are draft dodgers and went overseas to evade its armed service requirement\\n\\nearlier klinsmann took part in a zoom conference call across the pacific where he learned of the recommendation that he be fired  the recommendation was made by a kfa committee dedicated to the technical and strategic review of the national team  but this is a recommendation only and has no teeth for enforcement  the final decision is in the hands of chung mongkyu  the kfa head that hails from the zillionaire hyundai jaebol family  chung is the former ceo of hyundai motors and currently heads hdc the construction arm of hyundai that builds highrise residential towers  plus he owns two kleague franchises and heads some halfdozen other positions in soccer and athletics  he is the face of korean soccer  it was was indeed chung that personally hired klinsmann  how he did so despite vehement opposition from certain kfa factions analysts and fans is now part of the lore documenting many decades of administrative incompetence of the korean football association\\n\\nhttpspreviewredditalfm1yy5rpic1pngwidth1920formatpngautowebpsf0b13665badc1047ad2803eb0e9df45b4a38b828\\n\\nhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtpp9dji7biehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtpp9dji7bie\\n\\ni thought at first this particular band of rather aging protestors was engaged in a parody protest  but no they are dead serious  their banner reads\\n\\nimmediately fire worldclass con man and grifter jrgen klinsmann who embarrassed 50million korean people  kfa president chung mongkyu who abused his power to hire this international con man must resign and take full responsibility\\n\\nthe protestor on the left is holding a wooden bar labeled bar of justice  the protestor on the right is holding a deflated soccer ball that symbolizes zerostrategy kicktheballdownthefield playing style  korean fans derisively call this type of playing style kickball soccer  in contrast with the tikitaka style of european soccer that emphasizes accurate passes and lateral movement  during its embarrassing semifinal loss to jordan klinsmanns team struggled to establish any offensive tempo and had zero shots on goal\\n\\nto understand this and other protests being staged by angry fans you have to be familiar with several recent developments surrounding south koreas national team\\n\\n former presidential candidate hong joonpyo now mayor of the city of daegu is calling for klinsmanns ouster httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfgqm4gpk2zmppyguw7zmn7ksa7zgcio2btoumsoykpounqa3d3dhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfgqm4gpk2zmppyguw7zmn7ksa7zgcio2btoumsoykpounqa3d3d  hong became famous in 2018 when he traveled to the us to make a case for south korea to develop nuclear weapons of its own  other politicians are starting to murmur and voice their concerns about the national team  yoon ally and national assemblyman kwon seongdong urged we are done examining coach klinsmanns performance  the football association has to now act  piling on the football team particularly by politicians is a national pastime only 6 weeks away from the national election  elections are typically very close in south korea agitating for the ouster of common villains klinsmann and chung could garner much needed lastminute votes\\n it has come to light that two korean soccer stars son heungmin and lee kangin engaged in a fisticuff where son dislocated his finger  this happened the night before the semifinal game  son was seen wearing a sling to keep his finger stationary during the game against jordan  other players confirmed the tiff and some players came out against lee claiming that hes headstrong and doesnt listen to senior players  some soccer fans are now pointing out why former nationalteam coach paulo bento never called up lee during his tenure as he may have noted lees disruptive behavior that went against team unity  fans of son have taken over lees instagram account and are leaving hatefilled comments to lee who has since apologized  but now they started to attack the instagram account of lees older sister who used to post and brag about his kid brothers exploits httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv5ju4zw1ohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv5ju4zw1o\\n several investigative pieces have emerged in south korea regarding klinsmanns failed coaching tenures at bayern munich toronto hertha bsc and his 6year tenure coaching the us soccer team  at focus has been his lack of strategic vision and football philosophy as well as his lax work ethic  particularly his penchant for travel to farflung places ostensibly to watch national team players play in foreign leagues  but the guy apparently liked to mix business with pleasure and his claim that hes checking out players rang hollow when he ran several businesses of his own  his business success depended on him being  a soccer celebrity  klinsmann was a cheerleadertouristcoach who liked to be seen celebrating goals but could never hold his own in the rarefied field of tactical and technical soccer  drawing xs and os to illustrate soccer formations was not exactly his forte he was a pom pomwielding cheerleader who never met a camera he didnt like  by the time his us stint was over everyone was made aware of his act except for the korean football association who may not have been sophisticated enough to tell apart a cheerleading celebrity from a technically sound and cerebral coach  httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrfhh7kik6wlistpl05hhnconqb3zpsrh2znppvjer4p2vqindex7httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrfhh7kik6wlistpl05hhnconqb3zpsrh2znppvjer4p2vqindex7\\n\\nlater the hecklers ended their protest by calling for son heungmins father to take over the national team  huh  sons dad is son woongjeong who runs a youth soccer academy in chooncheon in the province of gangwon  earlier he had left an enigmatic comment regarding his sons exploits as the korean team made it to the semifinals at quatar  the korean national team should never win the asian cup  if it does the current woes and decay mismanagement by the korean football association will continue  this earlier comment resonated with the protestors who became enraged upon witnessing kickball soccer being played in the teams onesided loss to jordan\\n\\nbut son sr has no experience coaching at the adult level  it doesnt matter  the sons are a family of saints in south korea  they can do anything'}, {'title': 'itinerary check',

online used mainly by chinese and japanese nationalist trolls to claim and justify that korea and koreans are a product of the han dynasty and the chinese my two cents', 'selftext': 'since ive seen quite a few people koreans and non koreans alike bring up the issue of han commanderies up quite often i firstly recommend you to read my posts that ive made a few years back because ive spent quite a fair bit of time debunking and deconstructing not only gija joseons historicity but also on why the han commanderies subsequently cannot be in pyongyang \\n\\nthe whole premise that the han commanderies is located in pyongyang is based off of the belief that gija and his successors resided in pyongyang followed by man wiman and his succesors of which there is almost no archaeological evidence that has been verified even by japanese colonial era archaeologists because it has nothing to do with the korean peninsula to begin with\\n\\nthe geobody known as the korean peninsula believe it or not is first mentioned in the sanguozhi weizhi dongyizhuan from the book of wei one of the texts from the collection of the 24 histories of china in the late 3rd century ce by the historian chen shou prior to that its even doubtful that the han dynasty inhabitants let alone court even knew the existence of the korean peninsula let alone the japanese islands another point to raise is that wa or wae is quite often conflated with japan during the han dynasty period but that too is quite problematic given the fact that in the book of the later han it states that the xianbei chieftain tanshihuai captured wa people to make them catch fish for his tribal confederation and the fact that wa or wae people referred to being to the east of kuaiji commandery hangzhou zhejiang province in southeastern china its only in the book of wei that wae refers to the people residing in kyushu island notably himiko \\n\\nthe han commanderies were in western liaoning and eastern hebei provinces not in pyongan hwanghae hamgyeong gangwon and gyeonggi provinces that has become consensus since the japanese colonial period in the 1910s \\n\\nfirstly when lelang commandery which was allegedly claimed to be in pyongyang since the 15th to 16th century ce by joseon literati like han baek gyeom and later on by jeong yak yong who believed in the historicity of gija coming to the korean peninsula that was the fundamental basis of the invented historical tradition that gave the justification for neo confucian ideology in medieval korea lelang commandery is in fact described in much earlier chinese geography texts most notably the shujing sugyeong from the han dynasty period 206 bce  220 ce to be where the jieshi mountain the eastern end of the great wall and the pae pei river meet at one point \\n\\nli tao yuan a 6th century ce geographer of the northern wei conflated goguryeos pyongyang which was in liaoyang liaoning province with the han commandery of lelang which was why in his shujingzhu sugyeongju he claimed that the pei river flowed in a southwesterly direction into the sea which again was not based on an independent survey of the geography of that area but asking questions and extrapolating based on his brief interview with a goguryeo envoy that visited the northern wei court at the time\\n\\n  \\nif pyongyang is where lelang commandery was well clearly jieshi mountain is supposed to be all over the way in north korea which means qin shi huangdi han wudi cao cao sui yangdi and tang taizong all went up a mountain in northwest korea and left their poetry and writing inscribed on the slopes of the mountains unfortunately for both japanese imperialists and chinese revisionists jieshi mountain is all over way thousands of kilometers to the west in qinhuangdao city to the east of beijing\\n\\nsince about 1987 you begin to see geography texts from the peoples republic of china by a chinese geographer tan qixiang showing the eastern end of the great wall going beyond shanhaiguan pass in qinhuangdao firstly to dandong liaoning province then all the way to mudanjiang heilongjiang province and other times all the way to the south of pyongyang pyongan province this is based on the fact that imanishi ryu and tsuda soukichi claimed that the eastern end of the great wall reached pyongyang or south of that so that it would satisfy the conditions of pyongyang being where lelang commandery is obviously they have found and have not yet validated any remains of the great wall stretching into the korean peninsula so far which is why the chinese great wall claims are bogus\\n\\n  \\nadditionally the pei river according to other earlier han dynasty texts from the 1st century ce such as the shuowen jiezi seolmoon haeja which is said to flow in a southeasterly direction into the sea all the rivers on the western side of the korean peninsula flow either in a westerly direction or southwesterly direction into the yellow sea the only rivers that flow in a southeasterly direction are in the eastern coast of the korean peninsula but unfortunately you find no lelang artefacts or evidence of han dynasty settlements in the eastern part of the korean peninsula more so than the western part thats why the pei river cannot be in pyongan hwanghae gyeonggi let alone even liaoning province the only closest rivers that flow in a southeasterly direction are in hebei province such as the daling river luan river hai river or chaobai river thats why the pei river is not the taedong river or chongchon river as tsuda or imanishi claimed over 100 years ago\\n\\n  \\nthirdly there have been recently translated excerpts of the diaries of sekino tadashi and other japanese officials in the chosen colonial government at the time from the 1910s to 1920s by the inha university gojoseon research institute and it actually talks about them visiting the antiques market in beijing to purchase han dynasty artefacts for the lelang display museum in pyongyang dr moon seong jae who was formerly at inha university gojoseon research institute has done quite an extensive job translating and discussing all these in detail in his 2016 book the han commanderies were in china unfortunately you have some academic at the university of helsinki called andrew miles logie who appears to have conflict of interest with ties to the confucius institute at the university of helsinki trying to argue that anyone who puts forward the argument that the han commanderies were not in the korean peninsula are nationalist pseudohistorians in fact ive never seen him ever deconstruct this evidence despite claiming to diagnose and debunk pseudohistory his phd dissertation as well as his recent publications are unfortunately a bunch of ad hominem and strawman attacks often aimed exclusively against korean heterodox scholarship that never properly grapple with these arguments but try to attack the alleged ethno nationalist character or persona of scholars with opposing views \\n\\n  \\nfourthly jeong in bo who was a historian in colonial era korea during the 1920s to 1940s before disappearing during the korean war refuted japanese claims of having found the jeomjaehyeon stele in the middle of a field in pyongyang and finding hundreds of stamp seals of the governors of various commanderies that were allegedly excavated from lelang tombs the gist of the counterarguments put forward by jeong was that prior to the 4th and 5th centuries ce there were no steles erected but rather inscriptions were etched into the side of mountains such as what qin shi huangdi and han wudi did when they went up mt jieshi in hebei province some 2100 to 2200 years ago the fact that a 1st century bce stele would exist and be found in the middle of a field that was coincidentally found by sekino tadashi is not only suspicious because its an anachronistic find \\n\\nmoreover the reason why jeong cast high doubt on the seals of the governors was not only the sheer number that they found which you dont even find in major cities such as luoyang and xian that were han dynasty capitals as well as satellite cities within the han empire at the time but also because there are anachronistic titles that simply did not exist a good example is that the governor of lelang commandery during the han dynasty was called lelang taishou whereas during the shortlived xin dynasty during wang mangs reign in the 1st century ce lelang was changed to lexian and a taishou governor was called a dayun some of the seals excavated say lelang dayun and lexian taishou which clearly shows that it is a forgery whilst if they only found lelang taishou and lexian dayun exclusively it would hold more credibility \\n\\nits also bizarre that they find very little ban liang or wu zhu cash currency that was used by the qin han cao wei and western jin dynasties in north korea even though a major epicentre of han commerce and settlement was in pyongyang you can find hordes of roman coins in england france spain portugal switzerland romania greece turkey egypt algeria morocco libya israel palestine syria lebanon and elsewhere that were formerly roman empire territories but you hardly find anything of similar quantity in north korea you have to wonder why when you do in guangdong fujian jiangxi anhui hubei hunan jiangsu zhejiang shaanxi shanxi shandong hebei and henan provinces\\n\\nfifthly in 1993 in jinzhou city western liaoning province a farmer found the seal of the lintun commandery easternmost of the four han commanderies governor in a vineyard which was reported to the archaeological teams at liaoning and jilin universities at the time professor bok gi dae at inha university gojoseon research institute was a phd student at the time when he actually visited that place and this appeared in a news report in mbc way back in 1997 he published this finding in a korean archaeological journal but korean historians or archaeologists did not respond to it because they too blindly hold onto the preestablished consensus for the past 100 or so years some people have spent decades building a career based on this japanese colonial archaeologicalhistorical framework that they have too much to lose if they overturn this which is why quite often they attack people who deviate from the status quo \\n\\nsixthly in 2014 they found the tomb of a lelang commandery inhabitant han hyeon do in a district in beijing that was being renovated to build a new set of apartment buildings from the 5th to 6th centuries ce this stirred a lot of controversy both in china and korea because according to the status quo historical narrative the han commandery of lelang was supposedly destroyed in 313 ce by goguryeo during micheon of goguryeos reign this is incorrect micheon of goguryeo never destroyed lelang commandery if you read the samguk sagi or the 24 histories of china in fact lelang commandery was only extinguished in the mid 5th century ce after the northern wei and goguryeo that were in a marriage alliance divided the northern yan state that was ruled by the feng family which happens to be in an area spanning western liaoning and eastern hebei province \\n\\nsubsequently you would have people raise the lelang commandery transfer theory from pyongyang to qinhuangdao which is quite a popular claim that was first coined by imanishi ryu to claim that lelang commandery was in pyongyang from 108 bce to 313 ce before being moved all the way to qinhuangdao when zhang tong a chieftain of the lelang inhabitants took 2000 residents all the way to pyongyang and then defected to the murong xianbei ruled northern yan state in qinhuangdao hebei province where a replacement lelang commandery was established across a span of 2000 to 3000 kilometres mind you even in the 17th century ce when park ji won a joseon era diplomat set out from seoul to beijing it took them 6 months to travel that distance when roads were better developed than 1300 years earlier during the western jin dynasty goguryeo would have surely intercepted zhang tong before he escaped to qinhuangdao from pyongyang if lelang was really in pyongyang but they did not you have to wonder why well the answer is simple because lelang commandery was not in the korean peninsula and the murong xianbei northern yan state never controlled any part of the korean peninsula as we all know these events all happened in hebei province which is why zhang tong and the escape of 2000 inhabitants from lelang which was a border facing region between goguryeo and the northern yan was feasible and without difficulty or being captured\\n\\nits quite ironic but chinese often complain about japanese imperialism but are more than ready to use japanese colonial imperialist historiography when it suits their agenda thats why chinese complaints about japanese imperialism come across as disingenuous in my eyes considering their new revisionist historiography vis a vis korea is not only based on sinocentrism chinese chauvinism but also japanese imperialist historiography'}, {'title': 'exploring gangwon do advice needed ', 'selftext': 'hello\\ni am from australia and

john doe 2003 gangwon south korea', 'selftext': 'at 1040am on friday april 18th 2003 a 56 year old man who ran a junk shop  was out repairing a guard rail as a side job with three colleagues on the side of national highway 31 near gwangchiryeong pass in inje county gangwon province south korea when he found three rice bags even though he was there to repair the guard rail and that the bags seemed suspicious the man thought that they could possibly have some scrap metal from the surrounding farms in the area that had been abandoned his main job being a junk collector he decided to search the bags however when he reached a hand inside he quickly recoiled in shock when he realized he had not felt metal but that he had touched a human leg the man immediately contacted the local police and upon their arrival an investigation began that is after they reformed their murder investigation group that they had actually disbanded just the morning before april 18th\\n\\npolice arrived and were immediately shocked to find that all three of the rice bags contained the dismembered remains of an adult male one bag held the mans neck and chest another held his abdomenthighs and the last bag held his legs the police enlisting the help of military forces searched the surrounding area for the head and hands of the deceased but were unable to locate them an autopsy performed by the nfs national forensics service would find that the mans body along with being cut into three different halves had been stabbed over 20 times these stab wounds were described as deep and that 21 of the knife wounds were located on the chest 7 of those stab wounds had even pierced the decedents heart as well as caused damage to his ribs the decedents body had been drained of its blood leaving investigators unable to estimate a time at which he had died\\n\\nthere were no signs of resistance leading investigators to believe that the decedent was restrained while he was killed even though his hands were never located they also believe that anger or resentment were involved in the ferocity of the violence inflicted upon the deceased police assumed that the decedent had been incapacitated through means of drugs or alcohol but this was dismissed when his blood alcohol content was 005 meaning he was slightly under the influence but still aware of what was going on around him no drugs such as anesthetics were found in his blood either this gave further credence to the restraint theory \\n\\nthe murder weapon used was believed to have been a sashimi knife a logging chainsaw was believed to have been utilized in the dismemberment of the body investigators also believe that he was killed in the middle of a premeditated assault with the dismemberment occuring after the fact the premeditation factor is supported by the blood being drained from the body to prevent blood spots which settle 3 to 4 hours after death from appearing it is also supported by the decision to cut bones off instead of the joints of the decedent which shows the perpetrator is proficient with a logging chainsaw one peculiar thing to note was that broken parts commonly seen at the ends of felled trees were also visible on the bones of the corpse said inspector kang changkwon of the seoul metropolitan police agencys forensic investigation team this supports their belief that the perpetrator has experience with tree cutting due to the patterns observed in the cut bones being akin to those seen on skillfully cut trees they believe the perpetrator may be a local or from another forested region of south korea due to their knowledge of the lesstraveled area investigators also theorize that the decedent was acquainted with the perpetrator but have never gone into detail about why they believe this \\n\\nthe decedent was an adult male of a sturdy muscular build who was 180cm 5 9 tall and weighed between 68 kgs 149 lbs and 90 kgs 198 lbs his age was estimated to be between 20 to 40 years old his blood type was found to be type a also of note were signs of a cosmetic procedure that had been performed on the decedents genitals done to enlarge them this procedure has been known to be popular with gangsters and those in the entertainment industry police believe the man was possibly violently murdered by a gang they also believe that there is some sort of grudge involved in the murder due to the violence seen in that the crime being described as overkill without the head or hands of the deceased the police also cannot identify him easily\\n\\npolice created and distributed leaflets in an attempt to find new information about the deceased they mailed information about the deceased to the families of 25000 people reported missing across south korea in 2003 the cost of this mail campaign was 5 million won or just short of 6000 usd today only three replies worth investigating were received and all were proven to not be a match through genetic analysis the entirety of inje county was even searched for six months for any missing man in their 20s to 40s who could be their decedent this search resulted in no new leads\\n\\n close attention was paid to the rice bags in which the remains were discovered these bags were found to have been manufactured in china this information led investigators to theorize that the decedent and perpetrator were possibly koreanchinese nationals however due to the high amount of bags of the same brand being in circulation at the time no new leads came from this also the fact that the decedents arms and head were never found lends more credence to the victim being a documented south korean citizen they might have incinerated the head and hands or disposed of them in a body of water to prevent identification via dental or fingerprint records investigators believe that the remains were left on the side of the mountainous road as a warning to others which leads to the possibility of gang involvement this does not mean that he could have also been involved in a business dispute of some kind and was taken out by a rival or an angry employee the perpetrators must have known the area the remains were discovered in well if they went further into the forests in the mountains around the road to dispose of the remains by burial they could never have been found or would have been found a lot later leaving the remains on the roadside gives off the vibe of the perpetrator letting others know that this is what happens when you wrong me\\n\\non july 31st of 2015 south koreas national assembly abolished the 25year term limit on 1st degree murder and implemented the taewani act meaning that there is no longer a statute of limitations for murder cases that have happened after august 1 2000 thankfully the cold case team for the provincial police agency in gangwon are still investigating what has come to be known as the inje gwangchiryeong pass incident and due to solving two other longterm cold cases recently they are optimistic that they can solve this one as well they are still tackling new leads and comparing data from missing persons with the decedents available dna however with limited manpower they are still pursuing justice for the victims of violent crimes in the cold cases they investigate until their perpetrators are found \\n\\nnotes\\n\\ninje county also known as injegun is located in gangwon province also known as gangwondo inje county has the lowest population density of any south korean county gangwon province is the least densely populated subdivision of the country\\n\\ngwangchiryeong pass is located in a deep forested area about 800 meters above sea level \\nnational route 31 is a national highway in south korea that connects gijang county busan

past two seasons of transit love recently and currently watching the 3rd season i cant help but compare  contrast between these shows since the producers are the same i just cant help but feel that the producers seem to intervene and disrupt more the developing relationships in my siblings romance compared to transit love\\n\\nin transit love the only interventiondisruption is the prohibition to date the ex until they get to the last date in jeju  they allow relationships to develop naturally and even if a guy and girl keeps choosing each other all the time they dont disrupt them\\n\\ni just felt that this trip to gangwon province they added rules to not choose someone they dated previously to create interference and keeps things interesting  the relationships just seem too early to be disrupted and not given a chance to grow naturally for example ss said that this date is kind of special since its an overnight trip opportunity to travel with someone  i think she would have chosen jung sub if she wasnt prohibited from choosing him  same with cho a who said she likes getting to know someone at a deeper level than getting to know someone new again\\n\\ni understand they need to keep things interesting but they also need to show how relationships develop somewhat naturally when the participants find that connection the series is only a few weeks and they dont have the luxury of time to get to know people at a deeper level so if they keep pushing them to meet different people vs get to know more the people they gravitate towards it defeats the purpose \\n\\nthe siblings are already there to create disruption or bridge for their siblings romance so i wish they will just let them choose naturally than imposing these rules that could disrupt early development of relationships'}, {'title': 'i am solo  s14e05  ep 96  20230510', 'selftext': ' reality dating show\\n\\nin search of a marriage partner hyperrealistic dating begins where singles gather and struggle

32  relegated to k league 2 \\n\\n fc seoul won their playoff against k league 2s busan ipark  \\n seongnam fc were promoted from k league 2  \\n ulsan won their champions league playoff and are in the group stages\\n\\nits impossible to write a concise summary of the 2018 season  you can get some of the details from the club guide below  but one of the most interesting stories actually comes from k league 2\\n\\nfor context you need to understand a bit about military service for footballers rather than take 2 years out of their career to serve in the military or do some kind of eg desk job service players can join one of two military football teams that play in the k league in k league 1 there is sangju sangmu and in k league 2 there is asan mugunghwa every player in these two teams is on loan for two years from another club in the k league sangju sangu is affiliated with the normal military whilst asan mugunghwa is affiliated with the police serving in the auxilliary police force is another way to do your service\\n\\nthe korean government recently decided to abolish the auxilliary police force by 2023 the police however decided to already wind down their sports teams putting an immediate halt on recruiting players and disbanding the teams in 2019\\n\\nnow the champions of k league 2 last season were asan mugunghwa they were in line for direct promotion to k league 1 to compete in the k league you need to have at least 20 players but by the time the next season started asan would only have 14 players as the loan deals ran out the league gave asan a deadline in november to submit a recruitment plan which they failed to do and so the promotion spot passed to secondplaced seongnam fc although that deadline and hence promotion was missed asan have how submitted a recruitment plan that would see their 14 serving players be supplemented by new signings that indicates the club will transition to an cityowned club with the help of the asan government\\n\\nfunnily or depressingly this is not the first time police fc won k league 2 and missed out on promotion  in 2016 ansan mugunghwa were crowned champions but at the end of that year moved from ansan to asan in line with the leagues policies they were registered as a brand new club\\n\\nk league 1 club guide\\n\\nclubs can have up to three foreign players in their squad plus an extra one from another afc nation although rare a player with north korea citizenship is not considered foreign most of those foreign places are taken by brazilians or players from the former yugoslavia eg k league veteran dejan damjanovic the exception to the foreigner rule is the goalkeeper  korean goalkeepers in the 90s were just so bad that a block on recruiting foreign goalieshttpwwwkleagueunitedcom201703foreigngoalkeepersinfavourofhtml was put in place to help encourage development of domestic talent it seems to have worked with korean goalkeepers often being signed abroad in asia at least\\n\\nthere is also a requirement to have u23 players fielded and on the bench with a failure to meet this impacting the number of substitutes that can be made article 30httpswwwkleaguecomaboutcompetition of the league rules\\n\\nyoull notice some of the clubs have a korean chaebol in their team name and even if its not in the name they may still be owned by a corporation behind the scenes this sounds very odd if youre not familiar with it but it is extremely common in japan china and korea it may just be a symptom of some of the teams being relatively recentlyfounded and perhaps isnt that unusual these days think red bull city group majority shareholders in the west however the number of citizen clubs owned by the local city or provincial government is on the rise  gyeongnam fc is one example\\n\\na lot of clubs probably like to think they have a derby with fc seoul because well its seoul but the  biggest and probably considered the national derby is the super match  between fc seoul and suwon samsung bluewings montenegrin damjanovic known simply as dejan formerly of seoul and now playing for suwon is the top scorer in this fixture\\n\\nheres the clubs by last seasons standing and since crests are a bit unstable on reddit at the moment heres an imgur album of all club crests and corresponding home kits for the 2019 seasonhttpimgurcomaw8dbla5\\n\\njeonbuk hyundai motors\\n\\njeonbuk are the dominant team in korea and one the of the teams you dont want to face in the champions league whoever you are theyve now won 4 out of the last 5 k league 1 titles and a most recent champions league title in 2016\\n\\ntheir rise to power over the last decade has been overseen by long term manager choi kanghee choi left at the end of last season to tianjin quanjintianhai daliang yifang fc in china korea seems to have a thing for portuguese managers these days and his replacement is one jos morais morais was assistant manager to jos mourinho for a period but as manager proper hes been a bit shit he was at two clubs in 2018 which included ushering barnsley into relegation to english league one how jeonbuk will fare after choi remains to be seen\\n\\nalthough jeonbuk cruised to the league title it would be difficult to call their season an outright success due to a horrendous 15 mins at the end of the second half in a home match against suwon in the champions league quarterfinal they turned the 3 goal deficit around in the seond leg when they travelled to suwon but went out on penalties \\n\\ngyeongnam fc\\n\\ngyeongnam were only promoted from k league 2 the previous season so coming second in k league 1 is something special top scorer in the league marco played his part with 26 goals\\n\\ngyeongnam will now feature in the champions league for the first time i thought that seems to have put the brakes on too many of their players departing but captain choi youngjun signed for jeonbuk in the winter transfer window a major loss is marco who was also top scorer in k league 2 in the year they were promoted who appears to have followed the money to china also off to china is key centreback park jisoo so basically the backbone of the team from defence to attack has left\\n\\nulsan hyundai\\n\\nknown as the horangi   the tigers  ulsan have had intermittent success in asia winning the champions league for the first and only time in 2012 in an unbeaten run\\n\\ntowards the end of the 2018 season ulsan were battling gyeongnam for the second spot which brings with it direct qualification to the champions league group stages rather than having a playoff they lost out but were widely expected to secure a direct qualification spot anyway when they faced daegu fc in the fa cup final ultimately they finished the season on a low losing 51 on aggregate to daegu in the final \\n\\npohang steelers\\n\\none of the few clubs that predates the formation of the k league pohang are another of the historical korean powerhouses they hold the record for the most number of champions league title 3 but their last title came in 2009\\n\\nfinishing fourth in the league they were hoping that ulsan would beat daegu in the fa cup final to pass their champions league spot on down but it didnt happen\\n\\njeju united\\n\\none of the original members of the k league founded as the yukong elephants in the seoul area as part of the decentralisation program they moved to bucheon kind of and were renamed as bucheon sk the decision to move to jeju in 2006 was an abrupt one and understandably deeply unpopular with the fans teams uprooting and moving elsewhere is a bit of a catalyst for the creation of new teams in korea and the fans formed bucheon fc 1995 in the absence of bucheon sk\\n\\nthe reason given for the relocation was to the address the imbalance in football teams being located around seoulgyeonggido and jeju did not have a pro team at the time but there are suggestions the owners sk group wanted to cut their investment and recoup some costs\\n\\nthere were recent rumours that jeju would move yet again back north to yongin but who knows \\n\\njeju had a pretty mediocre season what more can i say\\n\\nsuwon samsung bluewings\\n\\nsuwons 2018 season was a bit bonkers and especially so in their champions league run\\n\\nin their champions league group in which they were drawn with eventual winners kashima antlers suwon did not manage a single home win however they had managed to get two away wins and going into the final match they still had their fate in their own hands if they could win against group leaders kashima in japan they won 10 getting three away wins and topping the group\\n\\nmanager seo jungwon at a time when suwon were 4th in the league resigned the day before the first leg of their champions league quarterfinal clash with jeonbuk due to fan protests jeonbuk were apparently completely bamboozled by this event and took a 30 beating at home then in the return leg in suwon jeonbuk fought back to win 30 but suwon were able to scrape through on penalties to face kashima antlers yet again in the semis\\n\\nin the semifinal fixture suwon went 20 up against kashima antlers inside the first 10 minutes but went on to lose 32 in the first leg\\nsoon after manager seo returned as suddenly as he had departed having been gone for just 6 weeks  \\nin the second leg suwon went a goal down in the first half but came back with 3 in the second half to be on their way to the final after 60 mins played however kashima antlers fought back to get two more goals and win 65 on aggregate and would go on to win the final if you want to relive a part of that rollercoaster night here you gohttpsyoutuberxy8pagy1aq and heres an idea of the atmosphere that nighthttpstwittercomtheafcclstatus1055055104607285248\\n\\nat one point it looked like they might qualify for the champions league again for the 2019 season but suwon didnt win any of their final five league matches and dropped to 6th\\n\\nmanager seo left again at the end of the season and will manage japans sagan tosu recently captain kim eunsun was released from the club for drinkdriving the drama just never ends\\n\\ndaegu fc\\n\\nprior to the world cup daegu were languishing at the bottom of the table but after the return they found some kind of consistent form helped out by world cup hero goalkeeper jo hyeonwoo they really peaked at the right time as daegu made it to the fa cup final and against the odds defeated ulsan hyundai 51 on aggregate meaning for the first time they will feature in the champions league this is no mean feat for team whose best ever finish in the top flight is 7th place if they carry over their momentum into the 2019 season the year could be one of their most successful ever they will also be playing in a new footballspecific stadium this year\\n\\ngangwon fc\\n\\ngangwon are a fairly midbottom team i dont really know what to say about them they did have the 2ndhighest top scorer in the 2018 season though bosnian uros deric they also had the worst colour scheme in the league last season their kit is slightly improved this season\\n\\nincheon united\\n\\ni always like to imagine that incheon chose their strip so that they could be the inter to fc seouls ac milan they even have a nickname nerazzurri another nickname is the durumi    the cranes\\n\\nincheon spent most of the 2018 season at the very bottom of table and had the jointleakiest defence in the league they brought in norwegian manager jrn andersen midway through the season to turn their fortunes around but even after that they were on the wrong end or the biggest thrashing of the season 70 against gangwon coming into the end of the season though they were playing really nice attacking football even if they didnt always get the result at the split they were still bottom but won 4 out of 5 games to pull themselves up 3 places\\n\\nit was in attack that incheon shone montenegrin stefan mugosa was their top scorer in his debut season moon seonmin with the best goal celebration in the league also put in a strong performance but has now signed for champions jeonbuk nam junjae returned in the summer to score some bangers costa rican international aguilar was also impressive but has signed for jeju in the new season\\n\\nsangju sangmu\\n\\nthe military team where other k league players get loaned to to complete their military service their history goes far back in one sense as various military teams were playing way back to the 50s but they were founded for pro footballers to serve their time only in 1984 although they were for pro players they competed in the semipro national league until 2003 when they joined the k league based in gwangju when gwangju fc were formed they moved to sangju\\n\\nsangju sangmu do not have any foreign players for obvious reasons and cannot compete in the champions league although the chances of ever finishing in a qualifying spot are fairly slim\\n\\nfc seoul\\n\\nfc seoul wow what happened having won the league in 2016 albeit somewhat fortuitously and always finishing in the top half if not competing for the title in the past decade nobody expected seoul to be fighting against relegation although relatively solid defensively they scored the least number of goals in the league season of all teams their star foreign players almost all left before the season started including dejan to rivals suwon and were not replaced with the same quality and for many matches seoul played with an allkorean team one bit of good news for the future is that former captain osmar will return from his loan to cezero osaka for the new season\\n\\nseoul at least managed to avoid relegation by beating busan ipark over two legs in the playoff helped by a red card in the first leg surprisingly they managed to score 3 goals in the first leg in open play\\n\\nseoul is probably the most popular club in korea im sure helped by the fact that it is the main club in a city of 10 million people  seoul generally has the highest game attendances although it was much reduced last season because they were so crap\\n\\nstarting out as luckygoldstar ie lg fc in chungcheong province the team was permitted to relocate to seoul at the start of the 90s and were renamed as lg cheetahs during the decentralisation period they moved to anyang modifying their name to anyang lg cheetahs after the world cup the team successfully negotiated a move back to seoul and did away with their cheetahs moniker taking their current name fc seoul their founding and rebirth years are both on their badge  1983 and 2004\\n\\nseongnam fc\\n\\ngaining direct promotion due to asan mugunghwas situation seongnam is actually the most decorated team in korea\\n\\nfounded in 1989 in seoul as ilhwa chunma they were forced out of seoul and settled in cheonnan for a period in 2000 they moved to seongnam a satellite city of seoul and appended the city name to the name of the club seongnams title drought started when the head of the owner company that backed seongnam died in 2012 and the board were keen to let go of the club seongnam city government took over ownership of the club for the 2014 season and they were renamed seongnam fc seongnam are now back in k league 1 after a 2 year absence\\n\\nk league 2 clubs\\n\\nby last seasons standings\\n\\njeonnam dragons\\n\\njeonbuks jeolla province rivals they finished the previous season on an awful losing streak and were relegated for the first time\\n\\nasan mugunghwa\\n\\npolice fc they missed promotion despite winning k league 2 and will probably lose their police affiliation by next year\\n\\nbusan ipark\\n\\none of the founding members of the k league and another that effectively predates the k league busan were beaten by k league 1 opposition in the prorel playoff for the second year in a row they were the first korean team to win the asian continental title in the 80s\\n\\ndaejeon citizen\\n\\none of the first communitycityowned clubs in korea\\n\\ngwangju fc\\n\\nrelegated in the 2017 season despite finishing 5th in 2018 they still got to participate in the playoffs due to asan mugunghwas situation\\n\\nfc anyang\\n\\nfounded in 2013 finally filling the void left by the departure of fc seoul from the city\\n\\nsuwon fc\\n\\nthe other suwon team they featured in k league 1 briefly in 2016\\n\\nbucheon fc 1995\\n\\nformed after the departure of jeju united from the city formed in 2007 1995 refers to the year of the organising of the yukong elephant fan club including 1995 in the name is meant to show its a club for the fans or something\\n\\nbucheon fc 1995 are also one half of the 032 derby with incheon united because they share the same area code 032\\n\\nansan greeners fc\\n\\nformed only in 2017 theyve had two 9thposition finishes\\n\\nseoul eland fc\\n\\nthe other seoul team their debut season was in 2015 they didnt do very well last season although it was very tight at the bottom of the table\\n\\nwinter transfer window activity\\n\\nfrom a monetary point of view korea is the biggest net exporterhttpsenynacokrviewaen20190131006600315sectionsportsindex of players in asia in the transfer market this winter window was no different with what i would say were the two biggest stories involving young homegrown korean talent going abroad\\n\\nthe first is that of jeonbuk and national team star centreback kim minjae nicknamed the monster there were rumours of an offer from english side watford but it wasnt clear if there ever was any offer or negotiations  kim himself said he did not know of any interest from watford it doesnt really matter now  kim signed with chinese side beijing sinobo guoan and will see champions league football with them in the new season being drawn in the same group as jeonbuk\\n\\nthe second is hwang inbeom who has signed for mls side vancouver whitecaps hwang inbeom played in k league 2 last season with asan mugunghwa and daejeon citizen but has impressed as a midfield playmaker and is currently seen as a replacement for ki sungyueng in the national team\\n\\nfor a recognisable name for western readers the best i have is englishman jordon mutch who signed for gyeongnam from crystal palace resulting in this awkward photo ophttpspbstwimgcommediadzg3adzvyaakrkqformatjpgnamemedium another recognisable name is mix diskerud on loan to ulsan from man city but he joined the previous year\\n\\nk league 1s top scorer marco left gyeongnam for hebei china fortune and his replacement is luc castaignos signed from sporting cp his stats in europe havent been great in recent years but he may fare better in korea\\n\\nthere were of course a few hundred domestic internal transfers and number of other foreign player signings  if you want the full list k league uniteds winter transfer trackerhttpwwwkleagueunitedcom2019012019kleaguewintertransfertrackerhtml has it all\\n\\n\\n\\nhistory of club football in korea  establishment of the k league\\n\\nassociation football was first introduced to korea in 1882 when british royal navy crew harboured at incheon played a game it wasnt until the 1900s that football began to take hold and the first public match was played in 1905 there was a boom in in the 1910s with a number of football clubs being formed and rivalries began to form between clubs in seoul and pyongyang\\n\\nthe first nationwide competition was the all joseon football tournament joseon being the name for korea at the time founded in 1921 there wasnt actually a champion crowned in 1921 as the tournament was cut short due to complaints over refereeing decisions all this was taking place during japanese occupation of korea during most of the first half of the 20th century\\n\\naccording to the kfahttpswebarchiveorgweb20170606162658httpkfaorkrrecordhistoryasp football was the only tonic that could relieve the the national resentment that had accumlated in the hearts as a colony under the japanese empire and was a sprout that could foster the hope of freedom a tad hyperbolic maybe\\n\\none side effect of being a japanese colony is that some korean teams were allowed to participate in the emperors cup japans fa cup and in 1935 kyungsung fc kyungsung was a name for seoul during japanese occupation won the tournament becoming the only nonjapanese team to ever do so\\n\\nthe all joseon football tournament ran until wwii\\n\\nafter wwii came korean independence and shortly thereafter the korean war there was football being played during this period continuously when possible the korean national semiprofessional football league was founded in 1964 and is the predecessor to todays tier 3 national league many of the teams during this period were works teams  employed by a company playing under the name of the company but also having a proper job in the company cha bumkun said by some to be the greatest ever asian footballer rose to fame during this period albeit mainly in the bundesliga starting his senior career at the mighty seoul trust bank fc the most astonishing statistic about cha bumkun is he only received one yellow card in his career\\n\\nfinally we get to the establishment of professional football with the korean super league in 1983 now named the k league initially there were only 5 teams and 2 of those teams dropped out within 2 years the number of clubs in the top flight has varied from the initial 5 to a high of 16 in 2011 in 2013 the k league split into two tiers now k league 1 and k league 2\\n\\nfor the first few years of the k league teams did not have a fixed home stadium that they played in because there was no standard homeaway format that we are so familiar with today instead it was operated as a national tour\\n\\nthe k league in the modern era has its own history but one of the most interesting events was the forced exodus of all three clubs from seoul in 1996 as part of a policy to spread the popularity of football around the country also with an eye on stadium infrastructure for the 2002 world cup two of the clubs didnt move far only just outside the city of seoul each to one of seouls satellite cities yukong elephants only halfleft because the city they moved to didnt have a stadium yet so they continued to play in seoul until a new stadium was built for a number of years the k league was without any seoul representation in 2004 after the need to find someone to fill a great big national football stadium and help pay towards it one of those relocated teams moved back to seoul becoming fc seoul\\n\\n\\n\\nfootball pyramid  league format\\n\\nthe current system looks like this\\n\\n\\n tier  league  notes \\n\\n 1  k league 1 12 teams 1 relegation to k league 2 1 relegation playoff with k league 2\\n 2  k league 2  10 teams 1 promotion to k league 1 1 promotion playoff with k league 2\\n 3  national league  8 teams semipro no promotionrelegation\\n 4  k3 league advanced  12 teams semiproamateur 2 relegations to k3 league basic 1 relegation playoff with k3 league basic \\n 5  k3 league basic 11 teams semiproamateur 2 promotions to k3 league advanced 1 promotion playoff with k3 league advanced \\n 6 division 5 league 6 regional leagues with 52 teams some relegation to division 6 \\n 7  division 6 league 26 regional leagues with 174 teams some prorel with divisions 5  7 \\n 8  division 7 league 160 regional leagues with 960 teams some promotion with division 6 \\n\\nas you can see the naming is completely screwed up  k3 league occupies tiers 4 and 5 and division 5 is in tier 6 this is probably because the top tier k league only split in two in 2013 with the creation on k league 2 and nobodys been bothered to update their names\\n\\nthe national league sits stubbornly in tier 3 blocking any continuous prorel the powers that be have regularly stated that they want to reform the pyramid to have a continuous route from top to bottom at least to the bottom of k3 league within a few years but for some reason its not happening the winners of the 2006 national league season were offered promotion to the k league but they declined the offer the winners of the 2007 season were also offered promotion but declined again even though they said they would like promotion at the start of the season\\n\\none of the more recent additions to the k league bucheon fc 1995 joined from k3 league because they didnt want to pay the higher fees associated with starting out in the national league\\n\\noutside of this system there is the wk league the womens top tier the wk league has been dominated by incheon red angels no connection to incheon united in recent years theres no womens champions league in asia yet but for a few years in the past the winners of the wk league played the winners of japans nadeshiko league for a little more info on the wk league see this reddit posthttpswwwredditcomrwomenssoccercommentsaqkew5southkoreasroutetotheworldcupthewkleague\\n\\nalso worth a mention is the separate u league for universities and colleges some of the teams from which enter into the korean fa cup the route into a pro team in korea is often direct from high school or university teams something i dont think exists in europe some high school teams are even seen as feeder teams for a particular pro team i wont pretend to understand how the system works but ill leave you with the tidbit that park jisung was first signed to a professional team from a university team almost by accident as the scout had come to see a different player but took home park instead\\n\\nk league 1\\n\\nk league 1 consists of 12 teams playing 38 games the format is identical to the scottish premiership  all teams play each other three times and then after the split the top 6 and bottom 6 battle it out among themselves to settle the championship and relegation spots respectively the first tie breaker for teams level on points is goals scored rather than goal difference\\n\\nthe top 3 places offer a chance in the afc champions league the fourth champions league spot going to the winner of the korean fa cup bottom place gets relegated to k league 2 whilst 11th place has a playoff with one of the teams that finished 2nd4th in k league 2\\n\\ninternational context\\n\\nin the current format of the afc champions league the competition is split into a west region think uae saudi arabia qatar iran and an east region the east region is dominated by three nations  korea china and japan australia who decided it wanted to be asian earlier this century has also had a bit of success\\n\\nthis year there will be two debutants from korea  gyeongnam fc and daegu fc its dufficult to predict how well these two will fare but if they can carry some form over to this year they could get out of the group stages at least\\n\\ndetermining who has the strongest teams amongst the big three east asian nations is a difficult task and is hugely subjective im almost i say almost because obviously k league is best league of the opinion that theyre as close to equal as makes no difference korea has the most number of titles and the club with the most titles pohang steelers china have the highest coefficient japan has won the past two tournaments\\n\\nin recent years china and japan have had a number of big star foreigner signings eg paulinho torres which are absent from the k league i believe this is due to japan having cash mainly coming from tv money and china having cash from well being china despite korea lagging financially all three nations have the same limit on foreign players three foreigners plus one from another afc country and so korean teams are still competitive due to the relative strength of their domestic players\\n\\nwhile were on the topic of the champions league each of the big three east asian nations get 4 places total  2 or 3 to the group stages and 1 or 2 to the last qualifying playoff round before the group stages this playoff round is massively weighted in the big threes favour as they have to win just one home game when the weather is still genrally freezing cold against a team from a nation with a tropical climate i dont know of a korean club ever losing this playoff match\\n\\nthe afc cup is sometimes said to be the equivalent

hopefully a long series of posts where we visit as much of the world as possible details at the bottom on how to contribute if youre willing\\n\\n\\n\\nrsoccer world tour 1  south korea  k league\\n\\n brief history\\n main rivalries\\n key moments of the past 10 years  final day deciders\\n current season\\n\\nbrief history\\n\\nsouth koreas k league is one of asias oldest professional leagues formed in 1983 club football was of course around prior to this with the first nationwide tournament having been played in 1921 although between japanese occupation and the aftermath of the korean war it wasnt always smooth sailing before 1983 the top tier was a semiprofessional league formed in 1964 which is presently effectively the 3rd and 4th divisions\\n\\nthe winners of the very first k league was won by koreas first professional club hallelujah fc whose purpose was promoting football and christian missionary work hallelujahs reign at the top was shortlived as they shortly after turned amateur to focus on their missionary work and embarked on a troubled history which included being driven out of town by protesting won buddhists\\n\\none of the more significant moments in the leagues history involved the stupid in my opinion decentralisation policy that forced 3 clubs out of seoul dismantling the dongdaemun derby all 3 clubs played in the same stadium one of those clubs would eventually move way down south to jeju island to become jeju united  a hugely unpopular move that earned them plenty of hate that still exists to this day another of those clubs would eventually be allowed to return to the capital to become fc seoul  also an unpopular move at the time\\n\\nin recent years jeonbuk has been the dominant force rising to the top under the care of longterm manager choi kanghee who oversaw 2 champions league titles and multiple league titles some healthy financial backing probably also helped but since manager choi has left and jeonbuks best players are continually scavanged by those higher up in the global food chain it looks like the sun may be beginning to set on jeonbuks dynasty\\n\\nspeaking of the champions league south korea is the most successful nation in asia in terms of titles although you might not know it from some recent performances with 6 different clubs having won it pohang steelers are also the jointmost successful club having won it 3 timeshttpsiimgurcom2pc1ws2jpg\\n\\nmain rivalries\\n\\npohang steelers vs ulsan hyundai    the east coast derby\\n\\nthere are quite a few clubs on the east coast in the southern corner of the countryhttpsiimgurcomwr635kijpg but the match between pohang steelers and ulsan hyundai is the east coast derby along with the super match see below the east coast derby is one of the biggest derbies in korea and although the super match now draws bigger crowds the east coast derby goes back further\\n\\npohang have their origins way back in the 50s as a steelworkers club and ulsan are still relatively old having joined the k league soon after its founding\\n\\nin the late 90s the rivalry revolved around a goalkeeper called kim byungji who i believe is still rocking a mullet to this day in a championship semifinal between the two kim scored a lastminute header to level the tie and delivered the win for ulsan in the subsequent penalty shootout shortly after kim came into conflict with ulsan over a move to europe and then transferred directly to pohang for a record fee following the transfer ulsan struggled against their rivals calling it the curse of kim byungji\\n\\nin the past decade pohang have twice denied ulsan the league title on the final day of the season once taking the title for themselves once simply beating them despite not really having anything to play for beyond causing some ptsd for details on these read on below in the key moments section\\n\\nthis season ulsan have been fairly convincing so far and won their two games against pohang with an aggregate scoreline of 60 lets just hope the k league dont schedule ulsans last game of the season to be against pohang again or at least that ulsan will have wrapped up the title by then\\n\\nfc seoul vs suwon samsung bluewings   the super match\\n\\nseoul is a denselypopulated city population 10 million like all huge cities it sprawls well beyond the city boundary the seoul metropolitan area makes up 12 of the country by area but it is home to 50 of koreas population within this area are a few satellite cities which include the likes of incheon and suwon\\n\\nout of the 22 teams in the top two divisions 9 are found within the seoul metropolitan area\\n\\nin 1996 as part of the k leagues decentralisation policy to spread the popularity of football around the country also with an eye on stadium infrastructure for the 2002 world cup the club that would come to be known as fc seoul was forced out of seoul city settling in the satellite city of anyang it was during this period that the rivalry with suwon grew  from geographic proximity the crossing of sides by players and coaching staff results on the field and possibly some kind of lg vs samsung rivalry the respective club owners at the time\\n\\nafter the world cup was finished there was a great big football stadium that needed to be filled and fc seoul successfully applied to move back to seoul maphttpsiimgurcomvlbrgdyjpg fc seoul now play in the northwest of seoul\\n\\nsome thought that the rivalry developed with suwon would fizzle out after the move from anyang but instead it has grown and it is always the super match that boasts the highest attendances in the league\\n\\nthe derby is also known to suwon fans as   expedition to conquer the north seoul is less than 20 miles north of suwon and to seoul supporters as    chickencatching day some say suwons mascot looks like a chicken and also something to do with the bluewings bird thing  suwons stadium has the nickname big bird\\n\\nin 2016 suwon and fc seoul were to face each other in the fa cup final and this instance was termed the super final the final was a twolegged affair in the first leg suwon won 21 at home the linked video is for the second leg in seoulhttpsyoutubeaapcrbotmnc and this return leg is the match to watch as it just has more urgency to it this one went to penalties  usually i dont enjoy a penalty shootout but this one was quite fun as it went down to the goalkeepers taking the penalties to decide it each team was down to 10 men after red cards suwon edged the victory but this final also marked the last time that suwon have beaten their rivals\\n\\nreferred to by fans this season as the  the miserable match due to both teams being generally terrible ironically it produced a game worthy of the name super match ending in a 33 draw with the woodwork being struck twice in the final minute of play highlightshttpsyoutubeap7grzmhxq a win over fc seoul for the first time since 2016 escaped suwon yet again although they may feel hard done by as the free kick that led to seouls equaliser was deemed not a foul by a refereeing review after the match\\n\\nboth teams are still pretty miserable this season both sacking their managers after lingering in the bottom half of the table fc seoul are maybe more hopeful due to the recent return of ki sungyueng after about a decade away travelling europe the next super match is this coming weekend\\n\\nkey moments\\n\\nwinning or maybe more accurately losing the league title on the final day of the season has become something of a tradition recently heres a few from the past decade\\n\\n2013\\n\\nheading into the final round of the 2013 season this is how the top of the table was looking\\n\\nteampldgdpts\\n\\n1bar2greenulsan372773\\n2bar2greenpohang steelers372471\\n3bar2limejeonbuk371262\\n\\nthe last fixture of the season was ulsan hyundai vs pohang steelers held in ulsan a draw would be enough to see ulsan crowned champions pohang needed a win the first half was very scrappy the second half slightly more like a normal game of football there was exactly one goal scored in this match and it was just so absolutely perfecthttpsyoutuberttj8onvk4t4m30s\\n\\nleading up to the goal one of ulsans star strikers kim shinwook who had to watch the game from the stands had pulled on his ulsan shirt and slowly made his way down to the touchline to join in for the imminent celebrations pohang had a free kick and a pohang player had just kicked an opposing player in the box for no apparent reason but it went unseen by the time it was taken it was already into the 5th minute of stoppage time sheer desperation got the ball across the line  celebrations and tears in the crowd kim shinwook quietly took his shirt off again\\n\\nresult ulsan 01 pohang pohang win the league\\n\\n2016\\n\\nheading into the final round of the 2016 season this is how the top of the table was looking\\n\\nteampldgfpts\\n\\n1bar2greenjeonbuk377167\\n2bar2greenfc seoul376667\\n3bar2limejeju united376856\\n\\nthe table doesnt quite tell the full story  jeonbuk had in fact been deducted 9 points after one of their scouts had been found guilty of attempting to bribe referees in 2013 so under normal circumstances jeonbuk would have wrapped up the league title by now as an aside this was the year jeonbuk won the champions league but due to the scandal they were not entered into the 2017 edition of the cl\\n\\nhowever the reality was that jeonbuk and seoul were level on points with jeonbuks goal stat putting them on top and the last fixture for these teams jeonbuk vs seoul at jeonbuk jeonbuk had already beaten fc seoul 3 times in the league this season and had also knocked them out in the semifinals of the champions league\\n\\narsenal legend park chuyoung came off the bench for fc seoul to score the only goal of the gamehttpsyoutube6zooll3ohbgt6m50s and once again show that you shouldnt head into the final game of the season only needing a draw this game had some other odd coincidences with the 2013 game  kim shinwook was once again on the losing team although on the field this time and fc seouls manager hwang sunhong was also pohangs manager back in 2013\\n\\nresult jeonbuk 01 fc seoul fc seoul win the league\\n\\n2019\\n\\nheading into the final round of the 2019 season this is how the top of the table was looking\\n\\nteampldgfpts\\n\\n1bar2greenulsan377079\\n2bar2greenjeonbuk377176\\n3bar2limefc seoul375355\\n\\nfinal game of the season ulsan led jeonbuk by 3 points they only needed a draw against pohang to win the league however this game was so much more than that being almost an exact rematch of the final game of the 2013 season it even took place on the same day of the year  this was a chance for ulsan to put that dark day behind them or to double down on the trauma although most of the players were different in 2019 the man between the sticks for ulsan was the same at least as kim seunggyu had returned midseason after a few years in japan\\n\\nwhat happened is that ulsan crumbled and lost 41 unfortunately for kim seunggyu he provided the mostrewatched moment of this match it is now the most famous throwin in k league history and possibly a truly unique moment one of the strangest ways to concede a goal ive ever seen in the 88th minute as ulsan were chasing an equaliser the ulsan goalkeeper takes the throwin to get the ball back in play quicklyhttpsyoutubedjkrbagf7mqt9m42s and throws it straight to an opposition player who puts it into an empty net you can see the manager entering his safe space that pretty much shut the door on ulsan and when pohang score their fourth 7 minutes into injury time you can see the goalkeeper was a broken man  \\nin hindsight maybe ulsans loss wasnt that unexpected pohang had already beaten ulsan twice this season prior to the game and pohang generally had a very strong end to the season\\n\\njeonbuk did their part by beating 6thplaced gangwon 10 topping the table on the tiebreaker of a single goal scored  \\nulsan were now 14 years without a league title although they have come runnersup three times in that period and won a champions league title\\n\\nresult ulsan 14 pohang jeonbuk win the league\\n\\ncurrent season\\n\\nthis season is something of a repeat of the 2019 season with regards to the title race  ulsan and jeonbuk have pulled clear of the rest ulsan currently 5 points ahead of jeonbuk however ulsan still has to play jeonbuk twice and they have a history of underperforming in the important games they played jeonbuk once already earlier this season it finished 20 to jeonbuk although an early red card for ulsan did throw the game somewhat that game was ulsans only loss of the season so far\\n\\nat the other end of the table its a familiar story for incheon  this is the third year in a row theyve been bottom of the table at this stage in the season but there is a feeling that this might finally be the year incheon goes down  it wasnt until round 16 that they recorded their first win of the season\\n\\none slight major oddity this season is that the relegation of sangju sangmu currently in 3rd place was already confirmed before the start of the season this season is looking to be their highest ever league finish but they can no longer use sangju stadium and will move south to the city of gimcheon from next year in the eyes of the k league they will be reforming as a brand new team and so will have to start out from the bottom again\\n\\ncurrent standings at round 19 out of a shortened 27game

perspective if rok and un hadnt lost the control of mount geumgang region in the pod point of divergence alternate scenario allied came up with better strategies to withdraw 5070 of us army regiments to mt geumgang region in early december 1950 so the north korea and chinese pva dont fully occupy mt geumgang region by the end of the korean war macarthur resigned on november 15 1949 over faulty intelligence on chinese pva movement and matthew ridgway ordered some us forces to withdraw to mt geumgang region to test the assessment by impeding aggressive chinese pva advance the chinese forces unsuccessfully dislodged the us soldiers and rok soldiers at the northern section of mt geumgang for several weeks after christmas 1950 and by late january 1950 the enemy took control of mt geumgang for several months ultimately allied forces regain mt geumgang region in late spring of 1950 thanks to military technological superiority the chinese pva and north korean forces failed to capture

the k league in k league 1 there is sangju sangmu and in k league 2 there is asan mugunghwa every player in these two teams is on loan for two years from another club in the k league sangju sangu is affiliated with the normal military whilst asan mugunghwa is affiliated with the police serving in the auxilliary police force is another way to do your service\\n\\nthe korean government recently decided to abolish the auxilliary police force by 2023 the police however decided to already wind down their sports teams putting an immediate halt on recruiting players and disbanding the teams in 2019\\n\\nnow the champions of k league 2 last season were asan mugunghwa they were in line for direct promotion to k league 1 to compete in the k league you need to have at least 20 players but by the time the next season started asan would only have 14 players as the loan deals ran out the league gave asan a deadline in november to submit a recruitment plan which they failed to do and so the promotion spot passed to secondplaced seongnam fc although that deadline and hence promotion was missed asan have how submitted a recruitment plan that would see their 14 serving players be supplemented by new signings that indicates the club will transition to an cityowned club with the help of the asan government\\n\\nfunnily or depressingly this is not the first time police fc won k league 2 and missed out on promotion  in 2016 ansan mugunghwa were crowned champions but at the end of that year moved from ansan to asan in line with the leagues policies they were registered as a brand new club\\n\\nk league 1 club guide\\n\\nclubs can have up to three foreign players in their squad plus an extra one from another afc nation although rare a player with north korea citizenship is not considered foreign most of those foreign places are taken by brazilians or players from the former yugoslavia eg k league veteran dejan damjanovic the exception to the foreigner rule is the goalkeeper  korean goalkeepers in the 90s were just so bad that a block on recruiting foreign goalieshttpwwwkleagueunitedcom201703foreigngoalkeepersinfavourofhtml was put in place to help encourage development of domestic talent it seems to have worked with korean goalkeepers often being signed abroad in asia at least\\n\\nthere is also a requirement to have u23 players fielded and on the bench with a failure to meet this impacting the number of substitutes that can be made article 30httpswwwkleaguecomaboutcompetition of the league rules\\n\\nyoull notice some of the clubs have a korean chaebol in their team name and even if its not in the name they may still be owned by a corporation behind the scenes this sounds very odd if youre not familiar with it but it is extremely common in japan china and korea it may just be a symptom of some of the teams being relatively recentlyfounded and perhaps isnt that unusual these days think red bull city group majority shareholders in the west however the number of citizen clubs owned by the local city or provincial government is on the rise  gyeongnam fc is one example\\n\\na lot of clubs probably like to think they have a derby with fc seoul because well its seoul but the  biggest and probably considered the national derby is the super match  between fc seoul and suwon samsung bluewings montenegrin damjanovic known simply as dejan formerly of seoul and now playing for suwon is the top scorer in this fixture\\n\\nheres the clubs by last seasons standing and since crests are a bit unstable on reddit at the moment heres an imgur album of all club crests and corresponding home kits for the 2019 seasonhttpimgurcomaw8dbla5\\n\\njeonbuk hyundai motors\\n\\njeonbuk are the dominant team in korea and one the of the teams you dont want to face in the champions league whoever you are theyve now won 4 out of the last 5 k league 1 titles and a most recent champions league title in 2016\\n\\ntheir rise to power over the last decade has been overseen by long term manager choi kanghee choi left at the end of last season to tianjin quanjintianhai daliang yifang fc in china korea seems to have a thing for portuguese managers these days and his replacement is one jos morais morais was assistant manager to jos mourinho for a period but as manager proper hes been a bit shit he was at two clubs in 2018 which included ushering barnsley into relegation to english league one how jeonbuk will fare after choi remains to be seen\\n\\nalthough jeonbuk cruised to the league title it would be difficult to call their season an outright success due to a horrendous 15 mins at the end of the second half in a home match against suwon in the champions league quarterfinal they turned the 3 goal deficit around in the seond leg when they travelled to suwon but went out on penalties \\n\\ngyeongnam fc\\n\\ngyeongnam were only promoted from k league 2 the previous season so coming second in k league 1 is something special top scorer in the league marco played his part with 26 goals\\n\\ngyeongnam will now feature in the champions league for the first time i thought that seems to have put the brakes on too many of their players departing but captain choi youngjun signed for jeonbuk in the winter transfer window a major loss is marco who was also top scorer in k league 2 in the year they were promoted who appears to have followed the money to china also off to china is key centreback park jisoo so basically the backbone of the team from defence to attack has left\\n\\nulsan hyundai\\n\\nknown as the horangi   the tigers  ulsan have had intermittent success in asia winning the champions league for the first and only time in 2012 in an unbeaten run\\n\\ntowards the end of the 2018 season ulsan were battling gyeongnam for the second spot which brings with it direct qualification to the champions league group stages rather than having a playoff they lost out but were widely expected to secure a direct qualification spot anyway when they faced daegu fc in the fa cup final ultimately they finished the season on a low losing 51 on aggregate to daegu in the final \\n\\npohang steelers\\n\\none of the few clubs that predates the formation of the k league pohang are another of the historical korean powerhouses they hold the record for the most number of champions league title 3 but their last title came in 2009\\n\\nfinishing fourth in the league they were hoping that ulsan would beat daegu in the fa cup final to pass their champions league spot on down but it didnt happen\\n\\njeju united\\n\\none of the original members of the k league founded as the yukong elephants in the seoul area as part of the decentralisation program they moved to bucheon kind of and were renamed as bucheon sk the decision to move to jeju in 2006 was an abrupt one and understandably deeply unpopular with the fans teams uprooting and moving elsewhere is a bit of a catalyst for the creation of new teams in korea and the fans formed bucheon fc 1995 in the absence of bucheon sk\\n\\nthe reason given for the relocation was to the address the imbalance in football teams being located around seoulgyeonggido and jeju did not have a pro team at the time but there are suggestions the owners sk group wanted to cut their investment and recoup some costs\\n\\nthere were recent rumours that jeju would move yet again back north to yongin but who knows \\n\\njeju had a pretty mediocre season what more can i say\\n\\nsuwon samsung bluewings\\n\\nsuwons 2018 season was a bit bonkers and especially so in their champions league run\\n\\nin their champions league group in which they were drawn with eventual winners kashima antlers suwon did not manage a single home win however they had managed to get two away wins and going into the final match they still had their fate in their own hands if they could win against group leaders kashima in japan they won 10 getting three away wins and topping the group\\n\\nmanager seo jungwon at a time when suwon were 4th in the league resigned the day before the first leg of their champions league quarterfinal clash with jeonbuk due to fan protests jeonbuk were apparently completely bamboozled by this event and took a 30 beating at home then in the return leg in suwon jeonbuk fought back to win 30 but suwon were able to scrape through on penalties to face kashima antlers yet again in the semis\\n\\nin the semifinal fixture suwon went 20 up against kashima antlers inside the first 10 minutes but went on to lose 32 in the first leg\\nsoon after manager seo returned as suddenly as he had departed having been gone for just 6 weeks  \\nin the second leg suwon went a goal down in the first half but came back with 3 in the second half to be on their way to the final after 60 mins played however kashima antlers fought back to get two more goals and win 65 on aggregate and would go on to win the final if you want to relive a part of that rollercoaster night here you gohttpsyoutuberxy8pagy1aq and heres an idea of the atmosphere that nighthttpstwittercomtheafcclstatus1055055104607285248\\n\\nat one point it looked like they might qualify for the champions league again for the 2019 season but suwon didnt win any of their final five league matches and dropped to 6th\\n\\nmanager seo left again at the end of the season and will manage japans sagan tosu recently captain kim eunsun was released from the club for drinkdriving the drama just never ends\\n\\ndaegu fc\\n\\nprior to the world cup daegu were languishing at the bottom of the table but after the return they found some kind of consistent form helped out by world cup hero goalkeeper jo hyeonwoo they really peaked at the right time as daegu made it to the fa cup final and against the odds defeated ulsan hyundai 51 on aggregate meaning for the first time they will feature in the champions league this is no mean feat for team whose best ever finish in the top flight is 7th place if they carry over their momentum into the 2019 season the year could be one of their most successful ever they will also be playing in a new footballspecific stadium this year\\n\\ngangwon fc\\n\\ngangwon are a fairly midbottom team i dont really know what to say about them they did have the 2ndhighest top scorer in the 2018 season though bosnian uros deric they also had the worst colour scheme in the league last season their kit is slightly improved this season\\n\\nincheon united\\n\\ni always like to imagine that incheon chose their strip so that they could be the inter to fc seouls ac milan they even have a nickname nerazzurri another nickname is the durumi    the cranes\\n\\nincheon spent most of the 2018 season at the very bottom of table and had the jointleakiest defence in the league they brought in norwegian manager jrn andersen midway through the season to turn their fortunes around but even after that they were on the wrong end or the biggest thrashing of the season 70 against gangwon coming into the end of the season though they were playing really nice attacking football even if they didnt always get the result at the split they were still bottom but won 4 out of 5 games to pull themselves up 3 places\\n\\nit was in attack that incheon shone montenegrin stefan mugosa was their top scorer in his debut season moon seonmin with the best goal celebration in the league also put in a strong performance but has now signed for champions jeonbuk nam junjae returned in the summer to score some bangers costa rican international aguilar was also impressive but has signed for jeju in the new season\\n\\nsangju sangmu\\n\\nthe military team where other k league players get loaned to to complete their military service their history goes far back in one sense as various military teams were playing way back to the 50s but they were founded for pro footballers to serve their time only in 1984 although they were for pro players they competed in the semipro national league until 2003 when they joined the k league based in gwangju when gwangju fc were formed they moved to sangju\\n\\nsangju sangmu do not have any foreign players for obvious reasons and cannot compete in the champions league although the chances of ever finishing in a qualifying spot are fairly slim\\n\\nfc seoul\\n\\nfc seoul wow what happened having won the league in 2016 albeit somewhat fortuitously and always finishing in the top half if not competing for the title in the past decade nobody expected seoul to be fighting against relegation although relatively solid defensively they scored the least number of goals in the league season of all teams their star foreign players almost all left before the season started including dejan to rivals suwon and were not replaced with the same quality and for many matches seoul played with an allkorean team one bit of good news for the future is that former captain osmar will return from his loan to cezero osaka for the new season\\n\\nseoul at least managed to avoid relegation by beating busan ipark over two legs in the playoff helped by a red card in the first leg surprisingly they managed to score 3 goals in the first leg in open play\\n\\nseoul is probably the most popular club in korea im sure helped by the fact that it is the main club in a city of 10 million people  seoul generally has the highest game attendances although it was much reduced last season because they were so crap\\n\\nstarting out as luckygoldstar ie lg fc in chungcheong province the team was permitted to relocate to seoul at the start of the 90s and were renamed as lg cheetahs during the decentralisation period they moved to anyang modifying their name to anyang lg cheetahs after the world cup the

when the head of the owner company that backed seongnam died in 2012 and the board were keen to let go of the club seongnam city government took over ownership of the club for the 2014 season and they

transfer window activity\\n\\nfrom a monetary point of view korea is the biggest net exporterhttpsenynacokrviewaen20190131006600315sectionsportsindex of players in asia in the transfer market this winter window was no different with what i would say were the two biggest stories involving young homegrown korean talent going abroad\\n\\nthe first is that of jeonbuk and national team star centreback kim minjae nicknamed the monster there were rumours of an offer from english side watford but it wasnt clear if there ever was any offer or negotiations  kim himself said he did not know of any interest from watford it doesnt really matter now  kim signed with chinese side beijing sinobo guoan and will see champions league football with them in the new season being drawn in the same group as jeonbuk\\n\\nthe second is hwang inbeom who has signed for mls side vancouver whitecaps hwang inbeom played in k league 2 last season with asan mugunghwa and daejeon citizen but has impressed as a midfield playmaker and is currently seen as a replacement for ki sungyueng in the national team\\n\\nfor a recognisable name for western readers the best i have is englishman jordon mutch who signed for gyeongnam from crystal palace resulting in this awkward photo ophttpspbstwimgcommediadzg3adzvyaakrkqformatjpgnamemedium another recognisable name is mix diskerud on loan to ulsan from man city but he joined the previous year\\n\\nk league 1s top scorer marco left gyeongnam for hebei china fortune and his replacement is luc castaignos signed from sporting cp his stats in europe havent been great in recent years but he may fare better in korea\\n\\nthere were of course a few hundred domestic internal transfers and number of other foreign player signings  if you want the full list k league uniteds winter transfer trackerhttpwwwkleagueunitedcom2019012019kleaguewintertransfertrackerhtml has it all\\n\\n\\n\\nhistory of club football in korea  establishment of the k league\\n\\nassociation football was first introduced to korea in 1882 when british royal navy crew harboured at incheon played a game it wasnt until the 1900s that football began to take hold and the first public match was played in 1905 there was a boom in in the 1910s with a number of football clubs being formed and rivalries began to form between clubs in seoul and pyongyang\\n\\nthe first nationwide competition was the all joseon football tournament joseon being the name for korea at the time founded in 1921 there wasnt actually a champion crowned in 1921 as the tournament was cut short due to complaints over refereeing decisions all this was taking place during japanese occupation of korea during most of the first half of the 20th century\\n\\naccording to the kfahttpswebarchiveorgweb20170606162658httpkfaorkrrecordhistoryasp football was the only tonic that could relieve the the national resentment that had accumlated in the hearts as a colony under the japanese empire and was a sprout that could foster the hope of freedom a tad hyperbolic maybe\\n\\none side effect of being a japanese colony is that some korean teams were allowed to participate in the emperors cup japans fa cup and in 1935 kyungsung fc kyungsung was a name for seoul during japanese occupation won the tournament becoming the only nonjapanese team to ever do so\\n\\nthe all joseon football tournament ran until wwii\\n\\nafter wwii came korean independence and shortly thereafter the korean war there was football being played during this period continuously when possible the korean national semiprofessional football league was founded in 1964 and is the predecessor to todays tier 3 national league many of the teams during this period were works teams  employed by a company playing under the name of the company but also having a proper job in the company cha bumkun said by some to be the greatest ever asian footballer rose to fame during this period albeit mainly in the bundesliga starting his senior career at the mighty seoul trust bank fc the most astonishing statistic about cha bumkun is he only received one yellow card in his career\\n\\nfinally we get to the establishment of professional football with the korean super league in 1983 now named the k league initially there were only 5 teams and 2 of those teams dropped out within 2 years the number of clubs in the top flight has varied from the initial 5 to a high of 16 in 2011 in 2013 the k league split into two tiers now k league 1 and k league 2\\n\\nfor the first few years of the k league teams did not have a fixed home stadium that they played in because there was no standard homeaway format that we are so familiar with today instead it was operated as a national tour\\n\\nthe k league in the modern era has its own history but one of the most interesting events was the forced exodus of all three clubs from seoul in 1996 as part of a policy to spread the popularity of football around the country also with an eye on stadium infrastructure for the 2002 world cup two of the clubs didnt move far only just outside the city of seoul each to one of seouls satellite cities yukong elephants only halfleft because the city they moved to didnt have a stadium yet so they continued to play in seoul until a new stadium was built for a number of years the k league was without any seoul representation in 2004 after the need to find someone to fill a great big national football stadium and help pay towards it one of those relocated teams moved back to seoul becoming fc seoul\\n\\n\\n\\nfootball pyramid  league format\\n\\nthe current system looks like this\\n\\n\\n tier  league  notes \\n\\n 1  k league 1 12 teams 1 relegation to k league 2 1 relegation playoff with k league 2\\n 2  k league 2  10 teams 1 promotion to k league 1 1 promotion playoff with k league 2\\n 3  national league  8 teams semipro no promotionrelegation\\n 4  k3 league advanced  12 teams semiproamateur 2 relegations to k3 league basic 1 relegation playoff with k3 league basic \\n 5  k3 league basic 11 teams semiproamateur 2 promotions to k3 league advanced 1 promotion playoff with k3 league advanced \\n 6 division 5 league 6 regional leagues with 52 teams some relegation to division 6 \\n 7  division 6 league 26 regional leagues with 174 teams some prorel with divisions 5  7 \\n 8  division 7 league 160 regional leagues with 960 teams some promotion with division 6 \\n\\nas you can see the naming is completely screwed up  k3 league occupies tiers 4 and 5 and division 5 is in tier 6 this is probably because the top tier k league only split in two in 2013 with the creation on k league 2 and nobodys been bothered to update their names\\n\\nthe national league sits stubbornly in tier 3 blocking any continuous prorel the powers that be have regularly stated that they want to reform the pyramid to have a continuous route from top to bottom at least to the bottom of k3 league within a few years but for some reason its not happening the winners of the 2006 national league season were offered promotion to the k league but they declined the offer the winners of the 2007 season were also offered promotion but declined again even though they said they would like promotion at the start of the season\\n\\none of the more recent additions to the k league bucheon fc 1995 joined from k3 league because they didnt want to pay the higher fees associated with starting out in the national league\\n\\noutside of this system there is the wk league the womens top tier the wk league has been dominated by incheon red angels no connection to incheon united in recent years theres no womens champions league in asia yet but for a few years in the past the winners of the wk league played the winners of japans nadeshiko league for a little more info on the wk league see this reddit posthttpswwwredditcomrwomenssoccercommentsaqkew5southkoreasroutetotheworldcupthewkleague\\n\\nalso worth a mention is the separate u league for universities and colleges some of the teams from which enter into the korean fa cup the route into a pro team in korea is often direct from high school or university teams something i dont think exists in europe some high school teams are even seen as feeder teams for a particular pro team i wont pretend to understand how the system works but ill leave you with the tidbit that park jisung was first signed to a professional team from a university team almost by accident as the scout had come to see a different player but took home park instead\\n\\nk league 1\\n\\nk league 1 consists of 12 teams playing 38 games the format is identical to the scottish premiership  all teams play each other three times and then after the split the top 6 and bottom 6 battle it out among themselves to settle the championship and relegation spots respectively the first tie breaker for teams level on points is goals scored rather than goal difference\\n\\nthe top 3 places offer a chance in the afc champions league the fourth champions league spot going to the winner of the korean fa cup bottom place gets relegated to k league 2 whilst 11th place has a playoff with one of the teams that finished 2nd4th in k league 2\\n\\ninternational context\\n\\nin the current format of the afc champions league the competition is split into a west region think uae saudi arabia qatar iran and an east region the east region is dominated by three nations  korea china and japan australia who decided it wanted to be asian earlier this century has also had a bit of success\\n\\nthis year there will be two debutants from korea  gyeongnam fc and daegu fc its dufficult to predict how well these two will fare but if they can carry some form over to this year they could get out of the group stages at least\\n\\ndetermining who has the strongest teams amongst the big three east asian nations is a difficult task and is hugely subjective im almost i say almost because obviously k league is best league of the opinion that theyre as close to equal as makes no difference korea has the most number of titles and the club with the most titles pohang steelers china have the highest coefficient japan has won the past two tournaments\\n\\nin recent years china and japan have had a number of big star foreigner signings eg paulinho torres which are absent from the k league i believe this is due to japan having cash mainly coming from tv money and china having cash from well being china despite korea lagging financially all three nations have the same limit on foreign players three foreigners plus one from another afc country and so korean teams are still competitive due to the relative strength of their domestic players\\n\\nwhile were on the topic of the champions league each of the big three east asian nations get 4 places total  2 or 3 to the group stages and 1 or 2 to the last qualifying playoff round before the group stages this playoff round is massively weighted in the big threes favour as they have to win just one home game when the weather is still genrally freezing cold against a team from a nation with a tropical climate i dont know of a korean club ever losing this playoff match\\n\\nthe afc cup is sometimes said to be the equivalent of uefas europa league but its not really comparable the afc cup is for the weaker asian nations only and korea arent allowed to enter\\n\\n\\n\\nresources\\n\\nwebsites  podcasts\\n\\nfor those of us

channelhttpswwwyoutubecomuserspotv spotv is a korean sports broadcaster they also upload content from the kbo baseball and the v league volleyball so youll have to scroll down until you see something saying k1 it helps if you know how korean letters sound phonetically to understand which teams are playing but you can also see which match a video is from the crests in the thumbnail the commentary will be in korean but each video is really good quality typically about 10 minutes long\\n\\nif you watch to watch live the good news is that is very easy and basically free i have no idea whether any national broadcasters or streaming services around the world have k league rights but in korea itself essentially every thing is streamed on korean online behemoth navers platform the one caveat is that live streams are region locked so to access them youll need a vpn to get a korean ip address although some other asian countries also seem to have access i wont repeat what others have already

gangwon province in northern south korea during a school trip to seoul when she was 16 yuna visited an arcade to her own surprise she found that she was able to easily master the fighters of the storm cabinet and on a whim decided to join an amateur tournament being held that night \\n\\nyuna easily won trumping the competition and drawing the interest of an investor who was putting a team together that was the start of yunas career in esports as she rose through the ranks eventually joining the prestigious team d known for hiring the best players in south korea \\n\\nit was with team d that she met hana song better known as dva and the two soon formed a strong friendship with yuna acting like an older sister and mentor to dva however their time in team d would not last long as yuna and hana were recruited for a secret military program known as meka the two were trained in combat and taught to pilot uniquely designed mechs designed to highlight their individual strengths \\n\\nyuna doesnt mind that hana was picked as the public image of meka she prefers to avoid the limelight focusing on her practice and a close knit group of friends\\n \\npersonal effects \\n\\nvoice \\n\\ngame about

thishttpswwwredditcomroverwatchcomments99njo6somethoughtsandspeculationaboutthenewmeka post while adding my own twist to it i decided dmons mech should be based more on fighting game characters as can be seen from the very unsubtle hadouken reference id also had an idea for a while of a character who changed roles when changing weapons but hadnt really found anywhere it could work until now \\n\\ni think shes pretty balanced with her strengths and flexibility being counteracted by short range but any critique is more than welcome i gave her a mixture of sustained area damage and burst solo damage to give her more tactical choices\\n\\n\\nas always im open to suggestions or possible improvements to the character\\n\\nalso check out my other characters if youre

second korean war has erupted between the kingdom of baekje and its civil war counterpart the new korean state after failed negotiations war has erupted and now there is war once again but wait theres

have teamed up and have set about fighting and supporting the new korean state referred to from now on as the nks\\n \\n \\nopening phases\\n \\nthe intervening coalition had made a significant arrangement beforehand with surveillance intelligence gathering and other such acts as such they were able to use the pull of information gathering to have an advantage over baekje in terms of situational and operational awareness which in turn allowed for a more capable and destructive sead campaign to be plotted out \\n \\nin the weeks leading up to the intervention all involved forces reached their jump off point and awaited the order to begin operations it was at this time japan withdrew from fighting in the conflict however they elected to allow columbian air and naval assets to use japanese military ports and airbases for this conflict as such a vast naval naval air and ground force will be operating in and around the korean peninsula including a formal naval blockade no fly zone and obvious restrictions on movement in the warzone \\n \\nmap of nks held territory inside the red outlines indicates definite positions while the red area outside is

c4isr tiltrotors and several different ew module attached union state submarines approached baekje held territory and began operating in a large electronic warfare and cyber warfare attack the suddenness and brute strength of the operating plan assisted with ground level intelligence assets causing a significant amount of damage and masking the coming first strike operations \\n \\nthe first strike began in earnest as the coalition unleashed a mass of guided missiles from naval and air units with weapons ranging from the thors hammerhttpswwwredditcomrworldpowerscomments5v19cftechfurthermissiledevelopmentaswellasemp emp cruise missile to the brahmos iv anti ship missiles along with the intervening states mass of conventional cruise missiles carefully plotted to hit vital targets the baekje naval presence feeling the worst hits as the massed brahmos anti ship missiles along with their foreign counterparts smashed their way into those baekje ships in port\\n \\n in the air columbian and union state air assets from the union state and from the columbian fleet assets in the chaos of the ew attack most anti air systems were unable to respond to the assets breaching baekje airspace with only a few baekje fighters making it into the air to meet the approaching force relatively unharassed the tu2000 bombers began their interdiction missions conducting large scale runway infrastructure destruction heavily damaging several major air bases and their associated hangers and maintenance infrastructure with the columbian air units conducting further seaddead operations alongside normal attack missions \\n \\nthe ground operations of the nks and coalition began after the completion of the coalitions initial naval and air strikes with 37 russian brigade combat groups and 10 chinese field divisions spearheading an advance into baekje held territory with the nks in toe supported by local nks groups the coalition ground forces in the north pushing forward rapidly into the territory of the off guard defenders by the end of the initial assault operation a rough line through existing highways reaching as far as gangwon province with several loyalist pockets being caught in the mountains however there was also a number of localised counter attacks in the rear areas stemming from an extensive tunnel network created by the regime existing positions and batteries employed by the state also suffered from coalition close air support disrupting and suppressing artillery stations and supply depots \\n \\nin the incheon region a large landing by russian and columbian marines stormed the beaches in a repeat of the korean war with the coalition striking out into incheon city however further advances were stalled by the transfer of several baekje units from seoul to the incheon area with those traveling by land often being intercepted highway of death style from union state and columbian aircraft and naval assets however a large portion traveling through existing tunnel infrastructure were able to arrive in incheon and its surroundings to put up a spirited defense stalling the marines in incheon

initial ew and attack securing the city and one of the airstrips the forces have been able to dig in a little as heavier equipment has been brought in through the airstrip via il77s \\n \\nin nks held busan another contingent of russian marines landed followed by a russian heavy brigade and a russian urban combat brigade landing not too long afterwards to support the push from busan to daequ where their vdv comrades are waiting \\nall over baekje troops have been fighting nks troops to further success than against the intervening forces tallying a massive toll on themselves along with the nks these attacks were mainly carried out by the moe homeguard and maiden army while the army mainly fought against the intervening forces the result for the melee grind is a severe toll upon the maid outfit equipped moe homeguard along with the nks m especially how theyre equipped with melee weapons\\n \\n\\n \\nother events\\n \\nbaekje during the first days of the conflict accidentally broadcasted orders to infect agents with a modified version of cholera and send them into refugee camps to try and spread the contagion to the chineese and russian publics this has spectacularly backfired and there is now not only public knowledge of the baekje regime being happily willing to use bio weapons confirmed with the infected agents being caught and put into containment but also a major cholera outbreak in baekje territory which is set out to kill a large number of people baekje agents infected with weaponised smallpox were also caught trying to infect the refugee population and as a result caught and put into containment visible only to the coalition with the failure for operational security around the bio weapons the coalition now knows the rough area where the biological weapons are being developed\\n \\nafter a few days of the no fly zone being put into effect several dozen civilian airliners took off from baekje held airports claiming to be full of civilians as per the no fly zone these were shot down however russian satellite images show no signs of any passengers \\n \\na number of korean merchant ships were intercepted by the blockading fleets or submarine wolf packs upon boarding and searching it was found that all of them were carrying nuclear weapons from the north korean era with the foolish intent to fly them over the capitals of those coalition members with weather balloons before detonating them ignoring the fact that the weather balloons cant carry the weight those nuclear devices 16 that were captured were defused as they appeared to be on a time fuze while those on the ships that were sunk unknowingly holding the nukes to the submarines detonated a few days later nearly 100 miles off shore finally one ship that slipped interception exploded near hawaii as the timer mechanism failed on one of the nukes and detonated nearly destroying a nearby airliner\\n \\n\\n \\nlosses\\n \\nkorea\\n \\ntype

of the russian economt over the next two years notably it will finalize the natural gas and oil exportation to east asia and put it into full productivity nations of interest will be the peoples republic of china the current state of the dprk and the republic of korea by fully fleshing out russian trade with east asia the russian federation will be able to put a decline to its economic partnerships with the european union additional plans will entail advancing the arctic trade routes for ships traveling through with adding outposts to the region for emergency situations and navigation for ships traveling through \\n\\n the beginning of the plan will see the construction of a set of pipelines in west mongolia to entail exportation to west china this set of pipelines will entail a total of three pipelines running through the region connected to natural gas and petroleum sites within siberia most notably the yamalonenets autonomus okrug where the majority of the russian federations natural gas lies these pipelines will have periodic compressor stations every 40100 miles and will travel through mongolia to the chinese city of urumqi and the provinces of gansu and ningxia this initiative will cost 3 billion dollars to complete and be one of the largest projects yet at 140 million cubic meters per year being exported on this set of pipelines mainly gansu and ningxia will be areas of export this will take one to two years\\n\\n the next part of the initiative will be constructing a pipeline extending from vladivostok to gangwon south korea this pipeline will then meet a large junction and compressor station within south korea where the pipeline will split to two pipelines servicing seoul and south jeolla the compressor and junction station will employ an estimated 1600 people the pipeline will be able to export a total of forty million cubic meters per year this project will cost another 5 billion dollars and take an estimated one to two years \\n\\n the next project will entail the construction of outposts in the russian eez within the arctic to protect merchant ships traveling through the now opened route several outposts manned by the ministry of interior will provide emergency services of any ships using the route in addition the ministry of interior will construct an array of communication towers to provide a degree of geographic guidance to ships traveling through the area this will cost an estimated 3 billion dollars and take three years to complete due to the harshness of the north \\n\\n we recommend that japan

death his two killers were swiftly arrested but much to everyones shock the victim seemingly rose from the dead', 'selftext': 'on april 29 1930 a woman in yeongcheon village in south korea a woman had left her home to travel to the small mountain in the village to pick out herbs and berries however she instead found the dead body of a boy she promptly and ran into the village hysterically screaming about the corpse\\n\\nsince korea was under occupation during this time period the japanese police were the ones to arrive at the scene they found the body of a boy with his face beaten beyond recognition and bruised all over aside from his clothes the only items of note were a fork towel and a korean aframe they transported the body to the nearest hospital for an autopsy where the chief physician determined that the body belonged to a boy between the ages of 15  16 the time of death was 72 hours before discovery and that the cause of death was strangulationsuffocation the mangling of his face was done postmortem and the bruises to his body were a result of a beating he had suffered before death the police determined that the towel is what was used to strangle him\\n\\nmurders seldom ever happened in this rural korean village and even thefts were rare so because of this the police figured that solving this would be easy as due to the small population of the village they assumed identifying the victim would be easy as they just had to ask the residents missing persons in the past week and thats when they learned about the only person from the village that went missing park changsoo who went disappeared on april 26 however no one thought much of it as he would often go missing before turning up fine\\n\\npark was born in either 1913 or 1914 most of his past life has been lost to history until september 1929 when he moved out of his home and instead chose to live in a small tent outside of the village while his 35yearold mother worked at either a tavern or an inn in march 1930 he joined a ground of beggars and wondered the village to hopefully get some money and food park was also described by the villages as being dimwitted but his physical prowess such as strength and speed made him a good errand boy\\n\\nthe body was presented to parks mother who tearfully identified it as the body of her son despite his clothes being different now that the police had the victim identified they started the murder investigation and learned that violence was involved in the last reported sighting of park back when he was alive\\n\\nwhen park was last seen alive on april 26 he was reportedly being beaten by the innkeeper named ko okdan and another labourer named cho kijun the two were arrested soon after and were interrogated for two days straight considering the time period back then in korea the interrogation was likely ruthless and possibly physical ko denied the accusations throughout while cho finally broke down and confessed to the murder and afterwards ko finally confessed as well this is a summary of the confession that was recorded by the japanese police\\n\\nthe innkeeper ko was the second wife of a rich man named han baekwon who lived a village over as hans first wife was jealous and did not want ko under the same roof ko was given allowance to set up an inn in yeongcheon\\n\\nko was in her early twenties at the time and supposedly she was popular with the men when a man named lee kimun asked her to run away with him instead of declining him she asked him for time to think for whatever reason park told han and han reprimanded ko\\n\\nfurious ko conspired to kill park with cho they took park to the mountains at night beat him and strangled him with the towel\\n\\nthe japanese police sent the two to the gongju district court where they were put on trial for parks murder cho was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment while ko was given 15 years for masterminding the crime even if cho was the one mainly responsible for the killing another reason for cho receiving a lesser sentence was because he had shown remorse upon hearing the sentence ko recanted his confession and appealed his sentence to the seoul reexamination court which on september 15 1930 upheld his conviction and with that the japanese police closed the case and handed the body over to parks mother where he was given a small burial ceremony\\n\\nlife in the village proceeded to go on as normal after the sentencing but on october 18 that same year the villagers were alarmed to hear a shriek coming from the home of parks mother with her loudly proclaiming that there was a spirit her neighbours went over to see what was going on and much to their shock there stood park changsoo clear as day and evidently alive\\n\\nafter everyone calmed down park explained what happened on april 26 ko okdan and cho kijun had brought him to the side of the mountain to beat him but according to him they never tried strangling him with the towel they only opted to beat him up as a result of the beating park had temporarily fallen unconscious but soon woke up alive and still at the mountain\\n\\npark however upon waking up undoubtedly thinking he had just cheated death decided to reflect on his life so far and felt unsatisfied with how things have been going so with that alongside the fact that he likely feared that ko and cho would finish the job if they saw him return decided to travel down the mountain the other way to work as a labourer in a different village before eventually making his way to seoul where he would work a series of odd jobs such as being a farmhand or a servant the last job he held during his brief attempt to start a new life was being a servant for a wealthy family however due to his low pay and the treatment by his employers he resigned on october 6 and decided that he would finally head back home to his village where he didnt even know that he was officially considered a murder victim\\n\\nthe japanese judiciary system and the police were both embarrassed once this came to light and all made attempts to point the finger at one another with the prosecutors blaming the police for a shoddy investigation and interrogation while the police blamed parks mother for misidentifying the body\\n\\na retrial was soon ordered against the prosecutions wishes and at trial both cho and ko stated they only confessed because the police beat and played mind games with them on june 30 1931 cho kijun was acquitted and on july 27 that same year ko okdan would be released as well both having spent nearly a year in prison for killing a boy who still lived\\n\\nafterwards the two most pressing questions had to be asked\\n\\n1 why did parks mother identify the body as her son\\n\\n2 and more importantly who did the dead body belong to\\n\\nonly the first of these two questions have been answered\\n\\nparks mother identified the body as her son because the police kept strongarming her and pressuring her into it at times straightup telling her that it was her sons body despite pointing out that he was wearing clothes that didnt belong to him the japanese police didnt much care for the korean population and especially not if they wasted their time or caused trouble with an old saying being the japanese police will take you if you cause mischief so it was best if parks mother told the police what they wanted to hear and gave positive identification to the body because if she continued to insist that they had the wrong boy his mother would likely have to suffer some form of consequences and besides everything else lined up with it being his body and since park was last seen being beaten she started to actually believe that it was really the body of her son\\n\\nsince their murder victim turned out to be alive and their two suspects were now proven innocent of parks murder the police were back at square one and reluctantly reopened the case to try and identify the body however by then it was too late all items found at the scene including the victims clothes were given to parks mother who buried them with the body and the police were unable to locate the grave meaning they couldnt exhume the body to examine it again and even if they could by then the remains would likely be skeletal and even still the korean resident registration system wasnt established back in the 30s so they couldnt check if any missing persons matching the bodies description happened recently the trial soon went killed and the body remains unidentified\\n\\nko and cho tried to seek compensation for their wrongful conviction however the courts turned them down as the police and court back then werent required to compensate the wrongfully convicted until 1933 and even then those who confessed to their crimes were not eligible to compensation even if their confession was coerced\\n\\nalthough it is possible that park is still alive today at the age of 106  107 its safe to say that almost everyone involved in this case is now dead and even if the killer is somehow still alive today the statute of limitations on this case have passed long ago so no action would be taken against him\\n\\npark enjoyed some modest fame but never sought out the limelight and just spent the rest of his life as a farmhand working with his mother at the start of this modest fame a lot of people from chungcheong province would try and get a look at him or just watch him walk down the street but he never indulged them and soon this fame faded\\n\\nseveral theories have been suggested to explain this strange case most are long shots\\n\\nthe most popular theory which im sure most of you are thinking is that park was actually an impostor however this theory has been thoroughly debunked for the following reasons\\n\\n1 it wasnt just his griefstricken mother who identified and was convinced that it truly was park the entire village and even the japanese police all came to the same conclusion\\n\\n2 although dna wasnt yet a thing back then fingerprints still were\\n\\n3 he never sought any fame and had nothing to gain from lying\\n\\n4 he was able to point out some belongings that belonged to park\\n\\n5 unlike most impostors in cases like this park and his mother werent well off to begin with and park was forced to work as a labourer due to his poor financial situation and thus would not be a poor choice of a person to impersonate if money was the motive and if it was like mentioned he never sought out any fame he just settled back into the village and worked as a farmhand further factoring into this is that it wasnt a very wellknown or sensational case in korea at the time either and only became one after park returned to the village\\n\\nanother theory is that park ko and cho were partners and all three killed this unidentified boy for whatever reason with the plan being that park would go into hiding after the murder knowing that police would likely identify him as the body while ko and cho would divert any suspicion and by the time park came out of hiding their names would be cleared and any evidence of this plot would have been lost in the meantime of course though nothing supports this theory and without a motive or identity for the victim its even harder to believe this has also been disproven due to the fact that ko and cho were last seen attacking the real park\\n\\nanother popular theory goes as follows\\n\\nremember lee kimun he was the man ko was ready to start an affair with before park told kos wealthy husband han baekwon about it this theory states that han paid park the boy who informed him about his wifes infidelity to kill lee and mangle his face afterwards han being a wealthy man would find a comfortable place to allow park to lay low and hide while hans wife would take the fall for killing who everyone would believe to be park the major flaw in this theory however is the autopsy conducted on the victim determined him to be 15  16 while lee was a grown man\\n\\nmany other theories were suggested as well but they are all longshots\\n\\nthis is one of the strangest cases in korean history and will likely never be solved\\n\\none thing worth noting however is that its possible park couldve lived through world war 2 and the eventual liberation of korea from the japanese the korean war and maybe even saemaul undong and as mentioned its entirely possible albeit unlikely that hes still alive as a centenarian\\n\\nsources\\n\\nhttpsshindongdongacom3all131067531httpsshindongadongacom3all131067531\\n\\nhttpsnamuwikiwecb2adec969120ec868ceb858420ec82b4ec9db8ec82aceab1b4tochttpsnamuwikiwecb2adec969120ec868ceb858420ec82b4ec9db8ec82aceab1b4toc\\n\\nother

and are in the group stages\\n\\nits impossible to write a concise summary of the 2018 season  you can get some of the details from the club guide below  but one of the most interesting stories actually comes from k league 2\\n\\nfor context you need to understand a bit about military service for footballers rather than take 2 years out of their career to serve in the military or do some kind of eg desk job service players can join one of two military football teams that play in the k league in k league 1 there is sangju sangmu and in k league 2 there is asan mugunghwa every player in these two teams is on loan for two years from another club in the k league sangju sangu is affiliated with the normal military whilst asan mugunghwa is affiliated with the police serving in the auxilliary police force is another way to do your service\\n\\nthe korean government recently decided to abolish the auxilliary police force by 2023 the police however decided to already wind down their sports teams putting an immediate halt on recruiting players and disbanding the teams in 2019\\n\\nnow the champions of k league 2 last season were asan mugunghwa they were in line for direct promotion to k league 1 to compete in the k league you need to have at least 20 players but by the time the next season started asan would only have 14 players as the loan deals ran out the league gave asan a deadline in november to submit a recruitment plan which they failed to do and so the promotion spot passed to secondplaced seongnam fc although that deadline and hence promotion was missed asan have how submitted a recruitment plan that would see their 14 serving players be supplemented by new signings that indicates the club will transition to an cityowned club with the help of the asan government\\n\\nfunnily or depressingly this is not the first time police fc won k league 2 and missed out on promotion  in 2016 ansan mugunghwa were crowned champions but at the end of that year moved from ansan to asan in line with the leagues policies they were registered as a brand new club\\n\\nk league 1 club guide\\n\\nclubs can have up to three foreign players in their squad plus an extra one from another afc nation although rare a player with north korea citizenship is not considered foreign most of those foreign places are taken by brazilians or players from the former yugoslavia eg k league veteran dejan damjanovic the exception to the foreigner rule is the goalkeeper  korean goalkeepers in the 90s were just so bad that a block on recruiting foreign goalieshttpwwwkleagueunitedcom201703foreigngoalkeepersinfavourofhtml was put in place to help encourage development of domestic talent it seems to have worked with korean goalkeepers often being signed abroad in asia at least\\n\\nthere is also a requirement to have u23 players fielded and on the bench with a failure to meet this impacting the number of substitutes that can be made article 30httpswwwkleaguecomaboutcompetition of the league rules\\n\\nyoull notice some of the clubs have a korean chaebol in their team name and even if its not in the name they may still be owned by a corporation behind the scenes this sounds very odd if youre not familiar with it but it is extremely common in japan china and korea it may just be a symptom of some of the teams being relatively recentlyfounded and perhaps isnt that unusual these days think red bull city group majority shareholders in the west however the number of citizen clubs owned by the local city or provincial government is on the rise  gyeongnam fc is one example\\n\\na lot of clubs probably like to think they have a derby with fc seoul because well its seoul but the  biggest and probably considered the national derby is the super match  between fc seoul and suwon samsung bluewings montenegrin damjanovic known simply as dejan formerly of seoul and now playing for suwon is the top scorer in this fixture\\n\\nheres the clubs by last seasons standing and since crests are a bit unstable on reddit at the moment heres an imgur album of all club crests and corresponding home kits for the 2019 seasonhttpimgurcomaw8dbla5\\n\\njeonbuk hyundai motors\\n\\njeonbuk are the dominant team in korea and one the of the teams you dont want to face in the champions league whoever you are theyve now won 4 out of the last 5 k league 1 titles and a most recent champions league title in 2016\\n\\ntheir rise to power over the last decade has been overseen by long term manager choi kanghee choi left at the end of last season to tianjin quanjintianhai daliang yifang fc in china korea seems to have a thing for portuguese managers these days and his replacement is one jos morais morais was assistant manager to jos mourinho for a period but as manager proper hes been a bit shit he was at two clubs in 2018 which included ushering barnsley into relegation to english league one how jeonbuk will fare after choi remains to be seen\\n\\nalthough jeonbuk cruised to the league title it would be difficult to call their season an outright success due to a horrendous 15 mins at the end of the second half in a home match against suwon in the champions league quarterfinal they turned the 3 goal deficit around in the seond leg when they travelled to suwon but went out on penalties \\n\\ngyeongnam fc\\n\\ngyeongnam were only promoted from k league 2 the previous season so coming second in k league 1 is something special top scorer in the league marco played his part with 26 goals\\n\\ngyeongnam will now feature in the champions league for the first time i thought that seems to have put the brakes on too many of their players departing but captain choi youngjun signed for jeonbuk in the winter transfer window a major loss is marco who was also top scorer in k league 2 in the year they were promoted who appears to have followed the money to china also off to china is key centreback park jisoo so basically the backbone of the team from defence to attack has left\\n\\nulsan hyundai\\n\\nknown as the horangi   the tigers  ulsan have had intermittent success in asia winning the champions league for the first and only time in 2012 in an unbeaten run\\n\\ntowards the end of the 2018 season ulsan were battling gyeongnam for the second spot which brings with it direct qualification to the champions league group stages rather than having a playoff they lost out but were widely expected to secure a direct qualification spot anyway when they faced daegu fc in the fa cup final ultimately they finished the season on a low losing 51 on aggregate to daegu in the final \\n\\npohang steelers\\n\\none of the few clubs that predates the formation of the k league pohang are another of the historical korean powerhouses they hold the record for the most number of champions league title 3 but their last title came in 2009\\n\\nfinishing fourth in the league they were hoping that ulsan would beat daegu in the fa cup final to pass their champions league spot on down but it didnt happen\\n\\njeju united\\n\\none of the original members of the k league founded as the yukong elephants in the seoul area as part of the decentralisation program they moved to bucheon kind of and were renamed as bucheon sk the decision to move to jeju in 2006 was an abrupt one and understandably deeply unpopular with the fans teams uprooting and moving elsewhere is a bit of a catalyst for the creation of new teams in korea and the fans formed bucheon fc 1995 in the absence of bucheon sk\\n\\nthe reason given for the relocation was to the address the imbalance in football teams being located around seoulgyeonggido and jeju did not have a pro team at the time but there are suggestions the owners sk group wanted to cut their investment and recoup some costs\\n\\nthere were recent rumours that jeju would move yet again back north to yongin but who knows \\n\\njeju had a pretty mediocre season what more can i say\\n\\nsuwon samsung bluewings\\n\\nsuwons 2018 season was a bit bonkers and especially so in their champions league run\\n\\nin their champions league group in which they were drawn with eventual winners kashima antlers suwon did not manage a single home win however they had managed to get two away wins and going into the final match they still had their fate in their own hands if they could win against group leaders kashima in japan they won 10 getting three away wins and topping the group\\n\\nmanager seo jungwon at a time when suwon were 4th in the league resigned the day before the first leg of their champions league quarterfinal clash with jeonbuk due to fan protests jeonbuk were apparently completely bamboozled by this event and took a 30 beating at home then in the return leg in suwon jeonbuk fought back to win 30 but suwon were able to scrape through on penalties to face kashima antlers yet again in the semis\\n\\nin the semifinal fixture suwon went 20 up against kashima antlers inside the first 10 minutes but went on to lose 32 in the first leg\\nsoon after manager seo returned as suddenly as he had departed having been gone for just 6 weeks  \\nin the second leg suwon went a goal down in the first half but came back with 3 in the second half to be on their way to the final after 60 mins played however kashima antlers fought back to get two more goals and win 65 on aggregate and would go on to win the final if you want to relive a part of that rollercoaster night here you gohttpsyoutuberxy8pagy1aq and heres an idea of the atmosphere that nighthttpstwittercomtheafcclstatus1055055104607285248\\n\\nat one point it looked like they might qualify for the champions league again for the 2019 season but suwon didnt win any of their final five league matches and dropped to 6th\\n\\nmanager seo left again at the end of the season and will manage japans sagan tosu recently captain kim eunsun was released from the club for drinkdriving the drama just never ends\\n\\ndaegu fc\\n\\nprior to the world cup daegu were languishing at the bottom of the table but after the return they found some kind of consistent form helped out by world cup hero goalkeeper jo hyeonwoo they really peaked at the right time as daegu made it to the fa cup final and against the odds defeated ulsan hyundai 51 on aggregate meaning for the first time they will feature in the champions league this is no mean feat for team whose best ever finish in the top flight is 7th place if they carry over their momentum into the 2019 season the year could be one of their most successful ever they will also be playing in a new footballspecific stadium this year\\n\\ngangwon fc\\n\\ngangwon are a fairly midbottom team i dont really know what to say about them they did have the 2ndhighest top scorer in the 2018 season though bosnian uros deric they also had the worst colour scheme in the league last season their kit is slightly improved this season\\n\\nincheon united\\n\\ni always like to imagine that incheon chose their strip so that they could be the inter to fc seouls ac milan they even have a nickname nerazzurri another nickname is the durumi    the cranes\\n\\nincheon spent most of the 2018 season at the very bottom of table and had the jointleakiest defence in the league they brought in norwegian manager jrn andersen midway through the season to turn their fortunes around but even after that they were on the wrong end or the biggest thrashing of the season 70 against gangwon coming into the end of the season though they were playing really nice attacking football even if they didnt always get the result at the split they were still bottom but won 4 out of 5 games to pull themselves up 3 places\\n\\nit was in attack that incheon shone montenegrin stefan mugosa was their top scorer in his debut season moon seonmin with the best goal celebration in the league also put in a strong performance but has now signed for champions jeonbuk nam junjae returned in the summer to score some bangers costa rican international aguilar was also impressive but has signed for jeju in the new season\\n\\nsangju sangmu\\n\\nthe military team where other k league players get loaned to to complete their military service their history goes far back in one sense as various military teams were playing way back to the 50s but they were founded for pro footballers to serve their time only in 1984 although they were for pro players they competed in the semipro national league until 2003 when they joined the k league based in gwangju when gwangju fc were formed they moved to sangju\\n\\nsangju sangmu do not have any foreign players for obvious reasons and cannot compete in the champions league although the chances of ever finishing in a qualifying spot are fairly slim\\n\\nfc seoul\\n\\nfc seoul wow what happened having won the league in 2016 albeit somewhat fortuitously and always finishing in the top half if not competing for the title in the past decade nobody expected seoul to be fighting against relegation although relatively solid defensively they scored the least number of goals in the league season of all teams their star foreign players almost all left before the season started including dejan to rivals suwon and were not replaced with the same quality and for many matches seoul played with an allkorean team one bit of good news for the future is that former captain osmar will return from his loan to cezero osaka for the new season\\n\\nseoul at least managed to avoid relegation by beating busan ipark over two legs in the playoff helped by a red card in the first leg surprisingly they managed to score 3 goals in the first leg in open play\\n\\nseoul is probably the most popular club in korea im sure helped by the fact that it is the main club in a city of 10 million people  seoul generally has the highest game attendances although it was much reduced last season because they were so crap\\n\\nstarting out as luckygoldstar ie lg fc in chungcheong province the team was permitted to relocate to seoul at the start of the 90s and were renamed as lg cheetahs during the decentralisation period they moved to anyang modifying their name to anyang lg cheetahs after the world cup the team successfully negotiated a move back to seoul and did away with their cheetahs moniker taking their current name fc seoul their founding and rebirth years are both on their badge  1983 and 2004\\n\\nseongnam fc\\n\\ngaining direct promotion due to asan mugunghwas situation seongnam is actually the most decorated team in korea\\n\\nfounded in 1989 in seoul as ilhwa chunma they were forced out of seoul and settled in cheonnan for a period in 2000 they moved to seongnam a satellite city of seoul and appended the city name to the name of the club seongnams title drought started when the head of the owner company that backed seongnam died in 2012 and the board were keen to let go of the club

exporterhttpsenynacokrviewaen20190131006600315sectionsportsindex of players in asia in the transfer market this winter window was no different with what i would say were the two biggest stories involving young homegrown korean talent going abroad\\n\\nthe first is that of jeonbuk and national team star centreback kim minjae nicknamed the monster there were rumours of an offer from english side watford but it wasnt clear if there ever was any offer or negotiations  kim himself said he did not know of any interest from watford it doesnt really matter now  kim signed with chinese side beijing sinobo guoan and will see champions league football with them in the new season being drawn in the same group as jeonbuk\\n\\nthe second is hwang inbeom who has signed for mls side vancouver whitecaps hwang inbeom played in k league 2 last season with asan mugunghwa and daejeon citizen but has impressed as a midfield playmaker and is currently seen as a replacement for ki sungyueng in the national team\\n\\nfor a recognisable name for western readers the best i have is englishman jordon mutch who signed for gyeongnam from crystal palace resulting in this awkward photo

left gyeongnam for hebei china fortune and his replacement is luc castaignos signed from sporting cp his stats in europe havent been great in recent years but he may fare better in korea\\n\\nthere were of course a few hundred domestic internal transfers and number of other foreign player signings  if you want the full list k league uniteds winter transfer trackerhttpwwwkleagueunitedcom2019012019kleaguewintertransfertrackerhtml has it all\\n\\n\\n\\nhistory of club football in korea  establishment of the k league\\n\\nassociation football was first introduced to korea in 1882 when british royal navy crew harboured at incheon played a game it wasnt until the 1900s that football began to take hold and the first public match was played in 1905 there was a boom in in the 1910s with a number of football clubs being formed and rivalries began to form between clubs in seoul and pyongyang\\n\\nthe first nationwide competition was the all joseon football tournament joseon being the name for korea at the time founded in 1921 there wasnt actually a champion crowned in 1921 as the tournament was cut short due to complaints over refereeing decisions all this was taking place during japanese occupation of korea during most of the first half of the 20th century\\n\\naccording to the kfahttpswebarchiveorgweb20170606162658httpkfaorkrrecordhistoryasp football was the only tonic that could relieve the the national resentment that had accumlated in the hearts as a colony under the japanese empire and was a sprout that could foster the hope of freedom a tad hyperbolic maybe\\n\\none side effect of being a japanese colony is that some korean teams were allowed to participate in the emperors cup japans fa cup and in 1935 kyungsung fc kyungsung was a name for seoul during japanese occupation won the tournament becoming the only nonjapanese team to ever do so\\n\\nthe all joseon football tournament ran until wwii\\n\\nafter wwii came korean independence and shortly thereafter the korean war there was football being played during this period continuously when possible the korean national semiprofessional football league was founded in 1964 and is the predecessor to todays tier 3 national league many of the teams during this period were works teams  employed by a company playing under the name of the company but also having a proper job in the company cha bumkun said by some to be the greatest ever asian footballer rose to fame during this period albeit mainly in the bundesliga starting his senior career at the mighty seoul trust bank fc the most astonishing statistic about cha bumkun is he only received one yellow card in his career\\n\\nfinally we get to the establishment of professional football with the korean super league in 1983 now named the k league initially there were only 5 teams and 2 of those teams dropped out within 2 years the number of clubs in the top flight has varied from the initial 5 to a high of 16 in 2011 in 2013 the k league split into two tiers now k league 1 and k league 2\\n\\nfor the first few years of the k league teams did not have a fixed home stadium that they played in because there was no standard homeaway format that we are so familiar with today instead it was operated as a national tour\\n\\nthe k league in the modern era has its own history but one of the most interesting events was the forced exodus of all three clubs from seoul in 1996 as part of a policy to spread the popularity of football around the country also with an eye on stadium infrastructure for the 2002 world cup two of the clubs didnt move far only just outside the city of seoul each to one of seouls satellite cities yukong elephants only halfleft because the city they moved to didnt have a stadium yet so they continued to play in seoul until a new stadium was built for a number of years the k league was without any seoul representation in 2004 after the need to find someone to fill a great big national football stadium and help pay towards it one of those relocated teams moved back to seoul becoming fc seoul\\n\\n\\n\\nfootball pyramid  league format\\n\\nthe current system looks like this\\n\\n\\n tier  league  notes \\n\\n 1  k league 1 12 teams 1 relegation to k league 2 1 relegation playoff with k league 2\\n 2  k league 2  10 teams 1 promotion to k league 1 1 promotion playoff with k league 2\\n 3  national league  8 teams semipro no promotionrelegation\\n 4  k3 league advanced  12 teams semiproamateur 2 relegations to k3 league basic 1 relegation playoff with k3 league basic \\n 5  k3 league basic 11 teams semiproamateur 2 promotions to k3 league advanced 1 promotion playoff with k3 league advanced \\n 6 division 5 league 6 regional leagues with 52 teams some relegation to division 6 \\n 7  division 6 league 26 regional leagues with 174 teams some prorel with divisions 5  7 \\n 8  division 7 league 160 regional leagues with 960 teams some promotion with division 6 \\n\\nas you can see the naming is completely screwed up  k3 league occupies tiers 4 and 5 and division 5 is in tier 6 this is probably because the top tier k league only split in two in 2013 with the creation on k league 2 and nobodys been bothered to update their names\\n\\nthe national league sits stubbornly in tier 3 blocking any continuous prorel the powers that be have regularly stated that they want to reform the pyramid to have a continuous route from top to bottom at least to the bottom of k3 league within a few years but for some reason its not happening the winners of the 2006 national league season were offered promotion to the k league but they declined the offer the winners of the 2007 season were also offered promotion but declined again even though they said they would like promotion at the start of the season\\n\\none of the more recent additions to the k league bucheon fc 1995 joined from k3 league because they didnt want to pay the higher fees associated with starting out in the national league\\n\\noutside of this system there is the wk league the womens top tier the wk league has been dominated by incheon red angels no connection to incheon united in recent years theres no womens champions league in asia yet but for a few years in the past the winners of the wk

enter into the korean fa cup the route into a pro team in korea is often direct from high school or university teams something i dont think exists in europe some high school teams are even seen as feeder teams for a particular pro team i wont pretend to understand how the system works but ill leave you with the tidbit that park jisung was first signed to a professional team from a university team almost by accident as the scout had come to see a different player but took home park instead\\n\\nk league 1\\n\\nk league 1 consists of 12 teams playing 38 games the format is identical to the scottish premiership  all teams play each other three times and then after the split the top 6 and bottom 6 battle it out among themselves to settle the championship and relegation spots respectively the first tie breaker for teams level on points is goals scored rather than goal difference\\n\\nthe top 3 places offer a chance in the afc champions league the fourth champions league spot going to the winner of the korean fa cup bottom place gets relegated to k league 2 whilst 11th place has a playoff with one of the teams that finished 2nd4th in k league 2\\n\\ninternational context\\n\\nin the current format of the afc champions league the competition is split into a west region think uae saudi arabia qatar iran and an east region the east region is dominated by three nations  korea china and japan australia who decided it wanted to be asian earlier this century has also had a bit of success\\n\\nthis year there will be two debutants from korea  gyeongnam fc and daegu fc its dufficult to predict how well these two will fare but if they can carry some form over to this year they could get out of the group stages at least\\n\\ndetermining who has the strongest teams amongst the big three east asian nations is a difficult task and is hugely subjective im almost i say almost because obviously k league is best league of the opinion that theyre as close to equal as makes no difference korea has the most number of titles and the club with the most titles pohang steelers china have the highest coefficient japan has won the past two tournaments\\n\\nin recent years china and japan have had a number of big star foreigner signings eg paulinho torres which are absent from the k league i believe this is due to japan having cash mainly coming from tv money and china having cash from well being china despite korea lagging financially all three nations have the same limit on foreign players three foreigners plus one from another afc country and so korean teams are still competitive due to the relative strength of their domestic players\\n\\nwhile were on the topic of the champions league each of the big three east asian nations get 4 places total  2 or 3 to the group stages and 1 or 2 to the last qualifying playoff round before the group stages this playoff round is massively weighted in the big threes favour as they have to win just one home game when the weather is still genrally freezing cold against a team from a nation with a tropical climate i dont know of a korean club ever losing this playoff match\\n\\nthe afc cup is sometimes said to be the equivalent of uefas europa league but its not really comparable the afc cup is for the weaker asian nations only and korea arent allowed to enter\\n\\n\\n\\nresources\\n\\nwebsites  podcasts\\n\\nfor those of us

comfortable after the update\\n\\n1 map data has reflected a number of different roadsexrpessways motorways and national roads and etc railroadssrt lane gangneung ktx line subway lines and etc and new towns such as vectorization updates the last update to google maps data was in april 2015\\n2 even if you rotate the map in any direction the letters on the map are properly aligned improving readability in the days of bitmap the letters displayed on the map were fixed northward making it very difficult to read even if you turn them in any direction making them less readable\\n3 supported night maps with vectorization\\n\\n whats less comfortable after the update\\n\\n1 an error occurs where the administrative districts of the republic of korea do not match for example sejong special selfgoverning city is marked as yeongi county south chungcheong province or the eup and myeon areas of cheongju city north chungcheong province are marked as cheongwon county in the past\\n2 since the data is still used for sk telecom even after vectorization data from the closest area to north korea is not displayed so it is not directly connected to north koreas roads\\n3 bicycle walking or car navigation is still unavailable they are expected to be available as early as january next year as google is conducting a closed beta test\\n4 korean map service in japanese is unavailable there is an error in which the place name is displayed in korean all languages are available except japanese russian arabic hebrew and chinese confirmed\\n5  since it uses road and railroad map data from sk telecoms t map  road names are all written in korean or english so it can be inconvenient for nonenglish speaking people however the purpose of the map is not to find a road but to find a place so

the group stages\\n\\nits impossible to write a concise summary of the 2018 season  you can get some of the details from the club guide below  but one of the most interesting stories actually comes from k league 2\\n\\nfor context you need to understand a bit about military service for footballers rather than take 2 years out of their career to serve in the military or do some kind of eg desk job service players can join one of two military football teams that play in the k league in k league 1 there is sangju sangmu and in k league 2 there is asan mugunghwa every player in these two teams is on loan for two years from another club in the k league sangju sangu is affiliated with the normal military whilst asan mugunghwa is affiliated with the police serving in the auxilliary police force is another way to do your service\\n\\nthe korean government recently decided to abolish the auxilliary police force by 2023 the police however decided to already wind down their sports teams putting an immediate halt on recruiting players and disbanding the teams in 2019\\n\\nnow the champions of k league 2 last season were asan mugunghwa they were in line for direct promotion to k league 1 to compete in the k league you need to have at least 20 players but by the time the next season started asan would only have 14 players as the loan deals ran out the league gave asan a deadline in november to submit a recruitment plan which they failed to do and so the promotion spot passed to secondplaced seongnam fc although that deadline and hence promotion was missed asan have how submitted a recruitment plan that would see their 14 serving players be supplemented by new signings that indicates the club will transition to an cityowned club with the help of the asan government\\n\\nfunnily or depressingly this is not the first time police fc won k league 2 and missed out on promotion  in 2016 ansan mugunghwa were crowned champions but at the end of that year moved from ansan to asan in line with the leagues policies they were registered as a brand new club\\n\\nk league 1 club guide\\n\\nclubs can have up to three foreign players in their squad plus an extra one from another afc nation although rare a player with north korea citizenship is not considered foreign most of those foreign places are taken by brazilians or players from the former yugoslavia eg k league veteran dejan damjanovic the exception to the foreigner rule is the goalkeeper  korean goalkeepers in the 90s were just so bad that a block on recruiting foreign goalieshttpwwwkleagueunitedcom201703foreigngoalkeepersinfavourofhtml was put in place to help encourage development of domestic talent it seems to have worked with korean goalkeepers often being signed abroad in asia at least\\n\\nthere is also a requirement to have u23 players fielded and on the bench with a failure to meet this impacting the number of substitutes that can be made article 30httpswwwkleaguecomaboutcompetition of the league rules\\n\\nyoull notice some of the clubs have a korean chaebol in their team name and even if its not in the name they may still be owned by a corporation behind the scenes this sounds very odd if youre not familiar with it but it is extremely common in japan china and korea it may just be a symptom of some of the teams being relatively recentlyfounded and perhaps isnt that unusual these days think red bull city group majority shareholders in the west however the number of citizen clubs owned by the local city or provincial government is on the rise  gyeongnam fc is one example\\n\\na lot of clubs probably like to think they have a derby with fc seoul because well its seoul but the  biggest and probably considered the national derby is the super match  between fc seoul and suwon samsung bluewings montenegrin damjanovic known simply as dejan formerly of seoul and now playing for suwon is the top scorer in this fixture\\n\\nheres the clubs by last seasons standing and since crests are a bit unstable on reddit at the moment heres an imgur album of all club crests and corresponding home kits for the 2019 seasonhttpimgurcomaw8dbla5\\n\\njeonbuk hyundai motors\\n\\njeonbuk are the dominant team in korea and one the of the teams you dont want to face in the champions league whoever you are theyve now won 4 out of the last 5 k league 1 titles and a most recent champions league title in 2016\\n\\ntheir rise to power over the last decade has been overseen by long term manager choi kanghee choi left at the end of last season to tianjin quanjintianhai daliang yifang fc in china korea seems to have a thing for portuguese managers these days and his replacement is one jos morais morais was assistant manager to jos mourinho for a period but as manager proper hes been a bit shit he was at two clubs in 2018 which included ushering barnsley into relegation to english league one how jeonbuk will fare after choi remains to be seen\\n\\nalthough jeonbuk cruised to the league title it would be difficult to call their season an outright success due to a horrendous 15 mins at the end of the second half in a home match against suwon in the champions league quarterfinal they turned the 3 goal deficit around in the seond leg when they travelled to suwon but went out on penalties \\n\\ngyeongnam fc\\n\\ngyeongnam were only promoted from k league 2 the previous season so coming second in k league 1 is something special top scorer in the league marco played his part with 26 goals\\n\\ngyeongnam will now feature in the champions league for the first time i thought that seems to have put the brakes on too many of their players departing but captain choi youngjun signed for jeonbuk in the winter transfer window a major loss is marco who was also top scorer in k league 2 in the year they were promoted who appears to have followed the money to china also off to china is key centreback park jisoo so basically the backbone of the team from defence to attack has left\\n\\nulsan hyundai\\n\\nknown as the horangi   the tigers  ulsan have had intermittent success in asia winning the champions league for the first and only time in 2012 in an unbeaten run\\n\\ntowards the end of the 2018 season ulsan were battling gyeongnam for the second spot which brings with it direct qualification to the champions league group stages rather than having a playoff they lost out but were widely expected to secure a direct qualification spot anyway when they faced daegu fc in the fa cup final ultimately they finished the season on a low losing 51 on aggregate to daegu in the final \\n\\npohang steelers\\n\\none of the few clubs that predates the formation of the k league pohang are another of the historical korean powerhouses they hold the record for the most number of champions league title 3 but their last title came in 2009\\n\\nfinishing fourth in the league they were hoping that ulsan would beat daegu in the fa cup final to pass their champions league spot on down but it didnt happen\\n\\njeju united\\n\\none of the original members of the k league founded as the yukong elephants in the seoul area as part of the decentralisation program they moved to bucheon kind of and were renamed as bucheon sk the decision to move to jeju in 2006 was an abrupt one and understandably deeply unpopular with the fans teams uprooting and moving elsewhere is a bit of a catalyst for the creation of new teams in korea and the fans formed bucheon fc 1995 in the absence of bucheon sk\\n\\nthe reason given for the relocation was to the address the imbalance in football teams being located around seoulgyeonggido and jeju did not have a pro team at the time but there are suggestions the owners sk group wanted to cut their investment and recoup some costs\\n\\nthere were recent rumours that jeju would move yet again back north to yongin but who knows \\n\\njeju had a pretty mediocre season what more can i say\\n\\nsuwon samsung bluewings\\n\\nsuwons 2018 season was a bit bonkers and especially so in their champions league run\\n\\nin their champions league group in which they were drawn with eventual winners kashima antlers suwon did not manage a single home win however they had managed to get two away wins and going into the final match they still had their fate in their own hands if they could win against group leaders kashima in japan they won 10 getting three away wins and topping the group\\n\\nmanager seo jungwon at a time when suwon were 4th in the league resigned the day before the first leg of their champions league quarterfinal clash with jeonbuk due to fan protests jeonbuk were apparently completely bamboozled by this event and took a 30 beating at home then in the return leg in suwon jeonbuk fought back to win 30 but suwon were able to scrape through on penalties to face kashima antlers yet again in the semis\\n\\nin the semifinal fixture suwon went 20 up against kashima antlers inside the first 10 minutes but went on to lose 32 in the first leg\\nsoon after manager seo returned as suddenly as he had departed having been gone for just 6 weeks  \\nin the second leg suwon went a goal down in the first half but came back with 3 in the second half to be on their way to the final after 60 mins played however kashima antlers fought back to get two more goals and win 65 on aggregate and would go on to win the final if you want to relive a part of that rollercoaster night here you gohttpsyoutuberxy8pagy1aq and heres an idea of the atmosphere that nighthttpstwittercomtheafcclstatus1055055104607285248\\n\\nat one point it looked like they might qualify for the champions league again for the 2019 season but suwon didnt win any of their final five league matches and dropped to 6th\\n\\nmanager seo left again at the end of the season and will manage japans sagan tosu recently captain kim eunsun was released from the club for drinkdriving the drama just never ends\\n\\ndaegu fc\\n\\nprior to the world cup daegu were languishing at the bottom of the table but after the return they found some kind of consistent form helped out by world cup hero goalkeeper jo hyeonwoo they really peaked at the right time as daegu made it to the fa cup final and against the odds defeated ulsan hyundai 51 on aggregate meaning for the first time they will feature in the champions league this is no mean feat for team whose best ever finish in the top flight is 7th place if they carry over their momentum into the 2019 season the year could be one of their most successful ever they will also be playing in a new footballspecific stadium this year\\n\\ngangwon fc\\n\\ngangwon are a fairly midbottom team i dont really know what to say about them they did have the 2ndhighest top scorer in the 2018 season though bosnian uros deric they also had the worst colour scheme in the league last season their kit is slightly improved this season\\n\\nincheon united\\n\\ni always like to imagine that incheon chose their strip so that they could be the inter to fc seouls ac milan they even have a nickname nerazzurri another nickname is the durumi    the cranes\\n\\nincheon spent most of the 2018 season at the very bottom of table and had the jointleakiest defence in the league they brought in norwegian manager jrn andersen midway through the season to turn their fortunes around but even after that they were on the wrong end or the biggest thrashing of the season 70 against gangwon coming into the end of the season though they were playing really nice attacking football even if they didnt always get the result at the split they were still bottom but won 4 out of 5 games to pull themselves up 3 places\\n\\nit was in attack that incheon shone montenegrin stefan mugosa was their top scorer in his debut season moon seonmin with the best goal celebration in the league also put in a strong performance but has now signed for champions jeonbuk nam junjae returned in the summer to score some bangers costa rican international aguilar was also impressive but has signed for jeju in the new season\\n\\nsangju sangmu\\n\\nthe military team where other k league players get loaned to to complete their military service their history goes far back in one sense as various military teams were playing way back to the 50s but they were founded for pro footballers to serve their time only in 1984 although they were for pro players they competed in the semipro national league until 2003 when they joined the k league based in gwangju when gwangju fc were formed they moved to sangju\\n\\nsangju sangmu do not have any foreign players for obvious reasons and cannot compete in the champions league although the chances of ever finishing in a qualifying spot are fairly slim\\n\\nfc seoul\\n\\nfc seoul wow what happened having won the league in 2016 albeit somewhat fortuitously and always finishing in the top half if not competing for the title in the past decade nobody expected seoul to be fighting against relegation although relatively solid defensively they scored the least number of goals in the league season of all teams their star foreign players almost all left before the season started including dejan to rivals suwon and were not replaced with the same quality and for many matches seoul played with an allkorean team one bit of good news for the future is that former captain osmar will return from his loan to cezero osaka for the new season\\n\\nseoul at least managed to avoid relegation by beating busan ipark over two legs in the playoff helped by a red card in the first leg surprisingly they managed to score 3 goals in the first leg in open play\\n\\nseoul is probably the most popular club in korea im sure helped by the fact that it is the main club in a city of 10 million people  seoul generally has the highest game attendances although it was much reduced last season because they were so crap\\n\\nstarting out as luckygoldstar ie lg fc in chungcheong province the team was permitted to relocate to seoul at the start of the 90s and were renamed as lg cheetahs during the decentralisation period they moved to anyang modifying their name to anyang lg cheetahs after the world cup the team successfully negotiated a move back to seoul and did away with their cheetahs moniker taking their current name fc seoul their founding and rebirth years are both on their badge  1983 and 2004\\n\\nseongnam fc\\n\\ngaining direct promotion due to asan mugunghwas situation seongnam is actually the most decorated team in korea\\n\\nfounded in 1989 in seoul as ilhwa chunma they were forced out of seoul and settled in cheonnan for a period in 2000 they moved to seongnam a satellite city of seoul and appended the city name to the name of the club seongnams title drought started when the head of the owner company that backed seongnam died in 2012 and the board were keen to let go of the club seongnam city government took over ownership of the club for the 2014 season and they were renamed seongnam fc seongnam are now back in k league 1 after a 2 year absence\\n\\nk league 2 clubs\\n\\nby

exporterhttpsenynacokrviewaen20190131006600315sectionsportsindex of players in asia in the transfer market this winter window was no different with what i would say were the two biggest stories involving young homegrown korean talent going abroad\\n\\nthe first is that of jeonbuk and national team star centreback kim minjae nicknamed the monster there were rumours of an offer from english side watford but it wasnt clear if there ever was any offer or negotiations  kim himself said he did not know of any interest from watford it doesnt really matter now  kim signed with chinese side beijing sinobo guoan and will see champions league football with them in the new season being drawn in the same group as jeonbuk\\n\\nthe second is hwang inbeom who has signed for mls side vancouver whitecaps hwang inbeom played in k league 2 last season with asan mugunghwa and daejeon citizen but has impressed as a midfield playmaker and is currently seen as a replacement for ki sungyueng in the national team\\n\\nfor a recognisable name for western readers the best i have is englishman jordon mutch who signed for gyeongnam from crystal palace resulting in this awkward photo ophttpspbstwimgcommediadzg3adzvyaakrkqformatjpgnamemedium another recognisable name is mix diskerud on loan to ulsan from man city but he joined the previous year\\n\\nk league 1s top scorer marco left gyeongnam for hebei china fortune and his replacement is luc castaignos signed from sporting cp his stats in europe havent been great in recent years but he may fare better in korea\\n\\nthere were of course a few hundred domestic internal transfers and number of other foreign player signings  if you want the full list k league uniteds winter transfer trackerhttpwwwkleagueunitedcom2019012019kleaguewintertransfertrackerhtml has it all\\n\\n\\n\\nhistory of club football in korea  establishment of the k league\\n\\nassociation football was first introduced to korea in 1882 when british royal navy crew harboured at incheon played a game it wasnt until the 1900s that football began to take hold and the first public match was played in 1905 there was a boom in in the 1910s with a number of football clubs being formed and rivalries began to form between clubs in seoul and pyongyang\\n\\nthe first nationwide competition was the all joseon football tournament joseon being the name for korea at the time founded in 1921 there wasnt actually a champion crowned in 1921 as the tournament was cut short due to complaints over refereeing decisions all this was taking place during japanese occupation of korea during most of the first half of the 20th century\\n\\naccording to the kfahttpswebarchiveorgweb20170606162658httpkfaorkrrecordhistoryasp football was the only tonic that could relieve the the national resentment that had accumlated in the hearts as a colony under the japanese empire and was a sprout that could foster the hope of freedom a tad hyperbolic maybe\\n\\none side effect of being a japanese colony is that some korean teams were allowed to participate in the emperors cup japans fa cup and in 1935 kyungsung fc kyungsung was a name for seoul during japanese occupation won the tournament becoming the only nonjapanese team to ever do so\\n\\nthe all joseon football tournament ran until wwii\\n\\nafter wwii came korean independence and shortly thereafter the korean war there was football being played during this period continuously when possible the korean national semiprofessional football league was founded in 1964 and is the predecessor to todays tier 3 national league many of the teams during this period were works teams  employed by a company playing under the name of the company but also having a proper job in the company cha bumkun said by some to be the greatest ever asian footballer rose to fame during this period albeit mainly in the bundesliga starting his senior career at the mighty seoul trust bank fc the most astonishing statistic about cha bumkun is he only received one yellow card in his career\\n\\nfinally we get to the establishment of professional football with the korean super league in 1983 now named the k league initially there were only 5 teams and 2 of those teams dropped out within 2 years the number of clubs in the top flight has varied from the initial 5 to a high of 16 in 2011 in 2013 the k league split into two tiers now k league 1 and k league 2\\n\\nfor the first few years of the k league teams did not have a fixed home stadium that they played in because there was no standard homeaway format that we are so familiar with today instead it was operated as a national tour\\n\\nthe k league in the modern era has its own history but one of the most interesting events was the forced exodus of all three clubs from seoul in 1996 as part of a policy to spread the popularity of football around the country also with an eye on stadium infrastructure for the 2002 world cup two of the clubs didnt move far only just outside the city of seoul each to one of seouls satellite cities yukong elephants only halfleft because the city they moved to didnt have a stadium yet so they continued to play in seoul until a new stadium was built for a number of years the k league was without any seoul representation in 2004 after the need to find someone to fill a great big national football stadium and help pay towards it one of those relocated teams moved back to seoul becoming fc seoul\\n\\n\\n\\nfootball pyramid  league format\\n\\nthe current system looks like this\\n\\n\\n tier  league  notes \\n\\n 1  k league 1 12 teams 1 relegation to k league 2 1 relegation playoff with k league 2\\n 2  k league 2  10 teams 1 promotion to k league 1 1 promotion playoff with k league 2\\n 3  national league  8 teams semipro no promotionrelegation\\n 4  k3 league advanced  12 teams semiproamateur 2 relegations to k3 league basic 1 relegation playoff with k3 league basic \\n 5  k3 league basic 11 teams semiproamateur 2 promotions to k3 league advanced 1 promotion playoff with k3 league advanced \\n 6 division 5 league 6 regional leagues with 52 teams some relegation to division 6 \\n 7  division 6 league 26 regional leagues with 174 teams some prorel with divisions 5  7 \\n 8  division 7 league 160 regional leagues with 960 teams some promotion with division 6 \\n\\nas you can see the naming is completely screwed up  k3 league occupies tiers 4 and 5 and division 5 is in tier 6 this is probably because the top tier k league only split in two in 2013 with the creation on k league 2 and nobodys been bothered to update their names\\n\\nthe national league sits stubbornly in tier 3 blocking any continuous prorel the powers that be have regularly stated that they want to reform the pyramid to have a continuous route from top to bottom at least to the bottom of k3 league within a few years but for some reason its not happening the winners of the 2006 national league season were offered promotion to the k league but they declined the offer the winners of the 2007 season were also offered promotion but declined again even though they said they would like promotion at the start of the season\\n\\none of the more recent additions to the k league bucheon fc 1995 joined from k3 league because they didnt want to pay the higher fees associated with starting out in the national league\\n\\noutside of this system there is the wk league the womens top tier the wk league has been dominated by incheon red angels no connection to incheon united in recent years theres no womens champions league in asia yet but for a few years in the past the winners of the wk league played the winners of japans nadeshiko league for a little more info on the wk league see this reddit posthttpswwwredditcomrwomenssoccercommentsaqkew5southkoreasroutetotheworldcupthewkleague\\n\\nalso worth a mention is the separate u league for universities and colleges some of the teams from which enter into the korean fa cup the route into a pro team in korea is often direct from high school or university teams something i dont think exists in europe some high school teams are even seen as feeder teams for a particular pro team i wont pretend to understand how the system works but ill leave you with the tidbit that park jisung was first signed to a professional team from a university team almost by accident as the scout had come to see a different player but took home park instead\\n\\nk league 1\\n\\nk league 1 consists of 12 teams playing 38 games the format is identical to the scottish premiership  all teams play each other three times and then after the split the top 6 and bottom 6 battle it out among themselves to settle the championship and relegation spots respectively the first tie breaker for teams level on points is goals scored rather than goal difference\\n\\nthe top 3 places offer a chance in the afc champions league the fourth champions league spot going to the winner of the korean fa cup bottom place gets relegated to k league 2 whilst 11th place has a playoff with one of the teams that finished 2nd4th in k league 2\\n\\ninternational context\\n\\nin the current format of the afc champions league the competition is split into a west region think uae saudi arabia qatar iran and an east region the east region is dominated by three nations  korea china and japan australia who decided it wanted to be asian earlier this century has also had a bit of success\\n\\nthis year there will be two debutants from korea  gyeongnam fc and daegu fc its dufficult to predict how well these two will fare but if they can carry some form over to this year they could get out of the group stages at least\\n\\ndetermining who has the strongest teams amongst the big three east asian nations is a difficult task and is hugely subjective im almost i say almost because obviously k league is best league of the opinion that theyre as close to equal as makes no difference korea has the most number of titles and the club with the most titles pohang steelers china have the highest coefficient japan has won the past two tournaments\\n\\nin recent years china and japan have had a number of big star foreigner signings eg paulinho torres which are absent from the k league i believe this is due to japan having cash mainly coming from tv money and china having cash from well being china despite korea lagging financially all three nations have the same limit on foreign players three foreigners plus one from another afc country and so korean teams are still competitive due to the relative strength of their domestic players\\n\\nwhile were on the topic of the champions league each of the big three east asian nations get 4 places total  2 or 3 to the group stages and 1 or 2 to the last qualifying playoff round before the group stages this playoff round is massively weighted in the big threes favour as they have to win just one home game when the weather is still genrally freezing cold against a team from a nation with a tropical climate i dont know of a korean club ever losing this playoff match\\n\\nthe afc cup is sometimes said to be the equivalent of uefas europa league but its not really comparable the afc cup is for the weaker asian nations only and korea arent allowed to enter\\n\\n\\n\\nresources\\n\\nwebsites  podcasts\\n\\nfor those of us who are linguistically challenged heres how you can follow k league in english\\n\\none of the best websites for news match previews and analysis is k league unitedhttpwwwkleagueunitedcom it covers everything  k league 1  2 fa cup transfer news national team and more it also has a podcast if youre into that sort of thing\\n\\na really good resource for uptodate breaking news is an english version of a korean news outlet the sports category of yonhap newshttpsenynacokrsportsindex for example is great although youll be getting other sports news in there such as korean baseball football appears pretty regularly also the team that works on writing the articles dont seem to work weekends\\n\\ntavern of the taeguk warriorshttpwwwtaegukwarriorscom has a lot of information mainly on the korean national team and tracks the progress of koreans playing in europe but covers the domestic club scene now and then\\n\\n48 shades of footballhttps48shadesblogcom is a great english language podcast following korean football\\n\\nthe asian gamehttpswwwtheasiangamenet is another great english language podcast that doesnt specifically follow korean football but since they cover asian football theyll sometimes have indepth coverage of the korean clubs competing in the afc champions league as well as the korean national team\\n\\nfor your twitter fix the korea football news korfootballnewshttpstwittercomkorfootballnews and viva la kleague kleagueno1httpstwittercomkleagueno1 twitter feeds are pretty quick with breaking news in english \\n\\nthere is also the official k league websitehttpwwwkleaguecom which can be viewed in english but i think unless you live in korea its going to be painfully slow to use\\n\\nthen of course theres rkleague with news and discussion and where you can ask questions to the community\\n\\nhighlights  watching live\\n\\nall highlights from k league 1 matches are uploaded fairly promptly to the spotv youtube channelhttpswwwyoutubecomuserspotv spotv is a korean sports broadcaster they also upload content from the kbo baseball and the v league volleyball so youll have to scroll down until you see something saying k1 it helps if you know how korean letters sound phonetically to understand which teams are playing but you can also see which match a video is from the crests in the thumbnail the commentary will be in korean but each video is really good quality typically about 10 minutes long\\n\\nif you watch to watch live the good news is that is very easy and basically free i have no idea whether any national broadcasters or streaming services around the world have k league rights but in korea itself essentially every thing is streamed on korean online behemoth navers platform the one caveat is that live streams are region locked so to access them youll need a vpn to get a korean ip address although some other asian countries also seem to have access i wont repeat what others have already written so heres a short guide to getting it workinghttpswwwredditcomrkleaguecomments7a3zpwkleaguetipsfordummies3icantwaittoget which also covers another route via the daum online portal or theres a comment in that thread which covers a more straightforward way by using the naver tv app\\n\\nthe kfa youtube channelhttpswwwyoutubecomuserkfatvcom has a bunch of nonk league highlights including the fa cup k3 and wk league highlights\\n\\nthe k league website also has plenty of highlights but again outside of korea it might be buffering for a long time'}, {'title': 'travelling around korea for 34

filipino internet personalities these new laws will reflect the changes in korea\\n\\n the e9 low skilled foreign worker visa currently allows foreigners to work for up to 4 years and 10 months in manufacturing agricultural construction and some services jobs resettlement of dependents is not legally permitted and this is a temporary visa many on these visas stay illegally and continue to work this will no longer be illegal but encouraged if after the 4 years and 10 months the worker can pass a test on korean culture and history and demonstrates basic korean language skills they may bring their immediate family over and stay here permanently\\n we will be introducing a new f7 visa ethnic koreans from anywhere in the world who prove their lineage from a korean citizen within 3 generations will be able to travel live study and work freely in korea for up to 5 years and must only reside here for 3 before naturalisation\\n young people in their final year of education on the d2 student visa may apply for a job seeking visa which they can live on for 6 months if they find a professional job in this time then they may naturalise after 6 months of work\\n we will introduce a new test which foreigners can take before applying for their visa the visa applicant skill assessment this will test their mathematical scientific and logical skills to see if they are particularly intellectually gifted those who score very highly may apply for a special d2 student visa which offers discounted education for the disadvantaged or for a visa which will allow them to live in korea for up to a year while they search for work when they can get an employment visa\\n foreign workers will receive the same legal working rights as natural born koreans the new foreign labor commission will ensure that these standards are being met and that foreigners are not mistreated with anonymous internet and telephone reporting systems and occasional random checks of employers with many reports\\n the foreign labor commission will set up a database of foreign workers with their qualifications skills and legal status which companies can search to quickly find suitable employees\\n antihate crime laws have been introduced to combat the racist abuse suffered by many workers verbal racial abuse will be punished by a fine of 1500 if crimes including assault criminal damage harassment murder sexual assault and burglary are shown to have been committed for racial reasons sentencing will be harsher\\n the employment permit system which requires foreigners to gain permission from employers before changing jobs leads to exploitation and will be scrapped instead they will only have to prove that they have received a job offer from another company to change jobs'}]\n",

illnesses jeollabukdo north jeolla province breathed a sigh of relief however with the jamboree being unable to be held in its entirety and the scout members leaving to events scheduled in other regions the province cannot hide its regret   \\n  \\non the 5th prime minister han deoksu stated considering the heat wave the government recommends organizing various programs in other regions outside of saemangeum and will provide sufficient support including transportation for those participants  \\n  \\nas a result the scout members from various countries will be moving to national tourist attractions and other places until the 12th to complete the remaining schedule  \\n  \\nwith the scout members who were mainly scheduled to be active in 14 cities and counties within jeollabukdo now venturing outside of the region local authorities must make significant modifications to the jamboree plans  \\n  \\nthe high expectations jeollabukdo had for this jamboree have been greatly disappointed   \\n  \\nit was hoped that a successful event would elevate the national brand image and accelerate the saemangeum development project leading the way for regional development however the extreme heat the carelessness of the organizing committee and inadequate preparations have hindered the events progress  \\n  \\nthe province had planned to conduct themebased fam tours for domestic and international influencers and bloggers producing various contentfilled videos for promotion on social networking services sns they also developed new travel courses including the saemangeum environmental ecological park  \\n  \\nadditionally they aimed to attract family travelers with mini jamboree experiences and planned to use cultural artistic and sports institutions to attract visitors building an image of jeollabukdo tourism  \\n  \\nhowever with the participants scattered in various areas these strategies are now at risk of being futile  \\n  \\nas a globally significant event the jamboree has substantial economic impacts both tangible and intangible and boosts the national brand image  \\n  \\nwith over 43000 participants staying for 12 days they are expected to engage in various korean cultural experiences and consume local goods vigorously resulting in substantial economic effects according to the analysis by the jeollabukdo research institute during the jamboree period an estimated 90000 visitors spending was expected to generate 755 billion won in production effects and create around 800 jobs within the province  \\n  \\njeollabukdo expected growth in its tourism industry through image promotion and brand advertising they also anticipated the potential growth in the tourism and camping industry by utilizing the jamboree site after its conclusion however it seems that the achievement of these goals has already failed  \\n  \\na representative from the province said on the 6th jeollabukdo and the 14 cities and counties had placed significant emphasis on preparing for the jamboree but various unforeseen factors forced us to modify our strategies adding while we are fortunate that the event has not been canceled altogether we cannot reasonably hope for any jamboree profits\\n\\nx200b'}, {'title': 'not sure how to continue my journey in korea', 'selftext': 'im currently in seoul since may 8th on thursday may

that cultural remnants of these different kingdoms still remain in different parts of south koreachungcheong gyeongsang jeolla urban core of seoulgyeonggi etc and dont even get me started on cultural

even if korea were to reunify gradually and safely theres no doubt the northern and south provinces will still have massive cultural differences and mindsets so why not give each province more control

oriented dating simulations love and producer by paper games  to share phone calls text and communicate by sns as well as to clear missions with card levels  in conclusion you need powers of fighting against the evils of cringe  although the manager that keeps trying to cross the line made me a bit nervous i tried to pick the most rational choices and build my affinity\\n\\ni thought i would be able to withstand it but it wasnt easy  the beginning was especially a bit of a crisis  why do we get one liners on a shiny background of things like copper tanned skin charismatic eyes or skin like white jade  in addition these are not even about fictional characters but of people who actually exist\\n\\nwriting this while squirming and wailing\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nwhile playing this game i focused on the game system as much as possible and regained my calm  im just a gamer that is raising up fictional characters  2012 is just another universe that the protagonist fell in  its just another possible past of the 14 million pasts that dr strange saw  selfhypnosis with these thoughts gave me peace\\n\\ni had noticed it while playing superstarbts as well but its not easy to tell people apart when theyre all styled like an album cover  many men dont really pay attention to faces of other men  it was my first  hurdle to become an army  army will know who they are even by looking at their shadows  as if to say this there were a lot of ux design that didnt tell me the name of the character  as a beginner i had no choice but to learn them\\n\\nfinally after learning the faces and characters of the bts members im writing down the initial impressions of the 7 members  these are just personal impression  im up to chapter 5 of the story\\n\\njin  he seems like a protagonist in a romantic comedy  with elegant impression and figure he is an ideal of a handsome man  there are not many things in the world that men hate as much as actual handsome men saying theyre handsome all the time  but whenever he opens his mouth there is something not quite all there about him  this must be his unexpected charms  he was so unexpectedly funny that i ended up actually laughing out loud a number of times  his character as the luxury version of the common neighborhood hyung is quite unique as well\\n\\nsuga  he seems to be the tsendere rule enforcer  during another story the genre suddenly changes into beethoven virus kdrama  he becomes suddenly the most serious person in the world when music comes up as a topic  did they say a man who has focus on his work is sexy  he seemed to hate bangtan sonyeondan group name the most i understand him  if you think hes a bit too sensitive he shows his caring side while pretending to be not caring  it felt like a female heroine from a typical maletargeted game had gotten swept in a storm and fell into a typical femaletargeted game\\n\\njhope  even when he is not in the centre of attention i could see he was always smiling  he doesnt say things that stand out too much  he has the aura of being able to mingle and get along well no matter which group he falls into  in the game he seems to be the type of subcharacter that is protagonists brother or hoobae that cheerfully leads the protagonist a few times  his cards especially seem to have poses that express im cute\\n\\nrm  he showed charisma even from the beginning of the game  if i met him in real life i would probably call him hyung  in reality anyone who seems more powerful is really the hyung  i thought he would be a sports man but it was interesting to find out he was studying creative literature  i also felt camaraderie when he kept losing or breaking things  he seems to be good at writing and is very logical  i would like to nominate him as potential winner if there were a keyboard battle contest\\n\\njimin  when i first saw bts i thought he was the youngest  he is cute and i really like his eyes  he appears as the grandson of a rice cake business and i think he would have fit well even if he really went into that business  i was surprised he had good acting in the another story  he seems to be the type that does everything well when given the chance  he was so attractive when he was wanting food it made me want to buy him a meal  his reactions are always good so teasing him seemed most satisfying  if i could have one of them as a younger brother i would choose jimin\\n\\nv  i really dont know  i cant define his character no even his mental world is not of this world  the speech does not go in introbuild upclimaxresolution but introresolution  character deoni dalbi in a book by lee youngdo had this type of speech and i didnt know i would meet such person in real life  if i were to live with someone like this life would never be boring  of course life would also never be peaceful but   when he wrote the lyrics glassmentality boy i liked his artistic emotions\\n\\njungkook  hes the youngest and he really does act like the youngest  the conversation images seemed to have been made to be especially cute  unlike jimin i feel like he would be hurt if i tease him so i cant tease him  initially he seemed like a kid who wanted to be mature but later on i could see a bit of that maturity as the character seemed to grow his image in the cards at times were so different that sometimes i could not recognize him  when hes smiling sometimes hes difficult to distinguish from jhope  he suddenly seems very dependable when he starts singing\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nx200b\\n\\ntime travel to 2012 is a bit of a cliche premise  the fact that we know they become world stars neutralizes the limits of idols in reality  as the protagonist already knows the future the player can focus on the details of each step as they naturally reach that point along the way\\n\\neven now i have each members profile up beside me as im working hard on this game  ive even found an error in the process v is from daegu but when he goes to the countryside he uses jeolla satoori  but outside of that i can see that they put in a lot of effort to be consistent with many things about bts  and it was interesting to play another story of what may have happened to the members if they did not become bts\\n\\nthe flower thats used to level up the cards is smeraldo and its a flower that doesnt exist created by bighit to sound like it existed to be used as hints in bts worldand many other tmis have been absorbed into my brain now  i might have to join army fanclub in order to finish this game\\n\\nx200b\\n\\nthe game ost heartbeat was a very nice song to listen to  and the mv cinematography wasnt cringy either  it looked like they put in a lot of effort and looks like a scene from a drama  the acting by members look natural too  the talk bubbles were the only part that was a bit difficult to watch\\n\\nbts world exploration has just started for me  since ive survived the trials and tribulations of adjusting to the game i will play this as far as i can  next article youll be able to see an ajussi manager in his 30s training the bts  the fact that it feels like im the one being trained rather than btssurely is just my

of the 2018 season  you can get some of the details from the club guide below  but one of the most interesting stories actually comes from k league 2\\n\\nfor context you need to understand a bit about military service for footballers rather than take 2 years out of their career to serve in the military or do some kind of eg desk job service players can join one of two military football teams that play in the k league in k league 1 there is sangju sangmu and in k league 2 there is asan mugunghwa every player in these two teams is on loan for two years from another club in the k league sangju sangu is affiliated with the normal military whilst asan mugunghwa is affiliated with the police serving in the auxilliary police force is another way to do your service\\n\\nthe korean government recently decided to abolish the auxilliary police force by 2023 the police however decided to already wind down their sports teams putting an immediate halt on recruiting players and disbanding the teams in 2019\\n\\nnow the champions of k league 2 last season were asan mugunghwa they were in line for direct promotion to k league 1 to compete in the k league you need to have at least 20 players but by the time the next season started asan would only have 14 players as the loan deals ran out the league gave asan a deadline in november to submit a recruitment plan which they failed to do and so the promotion spot passed to secondplaced seongnam fc although that deadline and hence promotion was missed asan have how submitted a recruitment plan that would see their 14 serving players be supplemented by new signings that indicates the club will transition to an cityowned club with the help of the asan government\\n\\nfunnily or depressingly this is not the first time police fc won k league 2 and missed out on promotion  in 2016 ansan mugunghwa were crowned champions but at the end of that year moved from ansan to asan in line with the leagues policies they were registered as a brand new club\\n\\nk league 1 club guide\\n\\nclubs can have up to three foreign players in their squad plus an extra one from another afc nation although rare a player with north korea citizenship is not considered foreign most of those foreign places are taken by brazilians or players from the former yugoslavia eg k league veteran dejan damjanovic the exception to the foreigner rule is the goalkeeper  korean goalkeepers in the 90s were just so bad that a block on recruiting foreign goalieshttpwwwkleagueunitedcom201703foreigngoalkeepersinfavourofhtml was put in place to help encourage development of domestic talent it seems to have worked with korean goalkeepers often being signed abroad in asia at least\\n\\nthere is also a requirement to have u23 players fielded and on the bench with a failure to meet this impacting the number of substitutes that can be made article 30httpswwwkleaguecomaboutcompetition of the league rules\\n\\nyoull notice some of the clubs have a korean chaebol in their team name and even if its not in the name they may still be owned by a corporation behind the scenes this sounds very odd if youre not familiar with it but it is extremely common in japan china and korea it may just be a symptom of some of the teams being relatively recentlyfounded and perhaps isnt that unusual these days think red bull city group majority shareholders in the west however the number of citizen clubs owned by the local city or provincial government is on the rise  gyeongnam fc is one example\\n\\na lot of clubs probably like to think they have a derby with fc seoul because well its seoul but the  biggest and probably considered the national derby is the super match  between fc seoul and suwon samsung bluewings montenegrin damjanovic known simply as dejan formerly of seoul and now playing for suwon is the top scorer in this fixture\\n\\nheres the clubs by last seasons standing and since crests are a bit unstable on reddit at the moment heres an imgur album of all club crests and corresponding home kits for the 2019 seasonhttpimgurcomaw8dbla5\\n\\njeonbuk hyundai motors\\n\\njeonbuk are the dominant team in korea and one the of the teams you dont want to face in the champions league whoever you are theyve now won 4 out of the last 5 k league 1 titles and a most recent champions league title in 2016\\n\\ntheir rise to power over the last decade has been overseen by long term manager choi kanghee choi left at the end of last season to tianjin quanjintianhai daliang yifang fc in china korea seems to have a thing for portuguese managers these days and his replacement is one jos morais morais was assistant manager to jos mourinho for a period but as manager proper hes been a bit shit he was at two clubs in 2018 which included ushering barnsley into relegation to english league one how jeonbuk will fare after choi remains to be seen\\n\\nalthough jeonbuk cruised to the league title it would be difficult to call their season an outright success due to a horrendous 15 mins at the end of the second half in a home match against suwon in the champions league quarterfinal they turned the 3 goal deficit around in the seond leg when they travelled to suwon but went out on penalties \\n\\ngyeongnam fc\\n\\ngyeongnam were only promoted from k league 2 the previous season so coming second in k league 1 is something special top scorer in the league marco played his part with 26 goals\\n\\ngyeongnam will now feature in the champions league for the first time i thought that seems to have put the brakes on too many of their players departing but captain choi youngjun signed for jeonbuk in the winter transfer window a major loss is marco who was also top scorer in k league 2 in the year they were promoted who appears to have followed the money to china also off to china is key centreback park jisoo so basically the backbone of the team from defence to attack has left\\n\\nulsan hyundai\\n\\nknown as the horangi   the tigers  ulsan have had intermittent success in asia winning the champions league for the first and only time in 2012 in an unbeaten run\\n\\ntowards the end of the 2018 season ulsan were battling gyeongnam for the second spot which brings with it direct qualification to the champions league group stages rather than having a playoff they lost out but were widely expected to secure a direct qualification spot anyway when they faced daegu fc in the fa cup final ultimately they finished the season on a low losing 51 on aggregate to daegu in the final \\n\\npohang steelers\\n\\none of the few clubs that predates the formation of the k league pohang are another of the historical korean powerhouses they hold the record for the most number of champions league title 3 but their last title came in 2009\\n\\nfinishing fourth in the league they were hoping that ulsan would beat daegu in the fa cup final to pass their champions league spot on down but it didnt happen\\n\\njeju united\\n\\none of the original members of the k league founded as the yukong elephants in the seoul area as part of the decentralisation program they moved to bucheon kind of and were renamed as bucheon sk the decision to move to jeju in 2006 was an abrupt one and understandably deeply unpopular with the fans teams uprooting and moving elsewhere is a bit of a catalyst for the creation of new teams in korea and the fans formed bucheon fc 1995 in the absence of bucheon sk\\n\\nthe reason given for the relocation was to the address the imbalance in football teams being located around seoulgyeonggido and jeju did not have a pro team at the time but there are suggestions the owners sk group wanted to cut their investment and recoup some costs\\n\\nthere were recent rumours that jeju would move yet again back north to yongin but who knows \\n\\njeju had a pretty mediocre season what more can i say\\n\\nsuwon samsung bluewings\\n\\nsuwons 2018 season was a bit bonkers and especially so in their champions league run\\n\\nin their champions league group in which they were drawn with eventual winners kashima antlers suwon did not manage a single home win however they had managed to get two away wins and going into the final match they still had their fate in their own hands if they could win against group leaders kashima in japan they won 10 getting three away wins and topping the group\\n\\nmanager seo jungwon at a time when suwon were 4th in the league resigned the day before the first leg of their champions league quarterfinal clash with jeonbuk due to fan protests jeonbuk were apparently completely bamboozled by this event and took a 30 beating at home then in the return leg in suwon jeonbuk fought back to win 30 but suwon were able to scrape through on penalties to face kashima antlers yet again in the semis\\n\\nin the semifinal fixture suwon went 20 up against kashima antlers inside the first 10 minutes but went on to lose 32 in the first leg\\nsoon after manager seo returned as suddenly as he had departed having been gone for just 6 weeks  \\nin the second leg suwon went a goal down in the first half but came back with 3 in the second half to be on their way to the final after 60 mins played however kashima antlers fought back to get two more goals and win 65 on aggregate and would go on to win the final if you want to relive a part of that rollercoaster night here you gohttpsyoutuberxy8pagy1aq and heres an idea of the atmosphere that nighthttpstwittercomtheafcclstatus1055055104607285248\\n\\nat one point it looked like they might qualify for the champions league again for the 2019 season but suwon didnt win any of their final five league matches and dropped to 6th\\n\\nmanager seo left again at the end of the season and will manage japans sagan tosu recently captain kim eunsun was released from the club for drinkdriving the drama just never ends\\n\\ndaegu fc\\n\\nprior to the world cup daegu were languishing at the bottom of the table but after the return they found some kind of consistent form helped out by world cup hero goalkeeper jo hyeonwoo they really peaked at the right time as daegu made it to the fa cup final and against the odds defeated ulsan hyundai 51 on aggregate meaning for the first time they will feature in the champions league this is no mean feat for team whose best ever finish in the top flight is 7th place if they carry over their momentum into the 2019 season the year could be one of their most successful ever they will also be playing in a new footballspecific stadium this year\\n\\ngangwon fc\\n\\ngangwon are a fairly midbottom team i dont really know what to say about them they did have the 2ndhighest top scorer in the 2018 season though bosnian uros deric they also had the worst colour scheme in the league last season their kit is slightly improved this season\\n\\nincheon united\\n\\ni always like to imagine that incheon chose their strip so that they could be the inter to fc seouls ac milan they even have a nickname nerazzurri another nickname is the durumi    the cranes\\n\\nincheon spent most of the 2018 season at the very bottom of table and had the jointleakiest defence in the league they brought in norwegian manager jrn andersen midway through the season to turn their fortunes around but even after that they were on the wrong end or the biggest thrashing of the season 70 against gangwon coming into the end of the season though they were playing really nice attacking football even if they didnt always get the result at the split they were still bottom but won 4 out of 5 games to pull themselves up 3 places\\n\\nit was in attack that incheon shone montenegrin stefan mugosa was their top scorer in his debut season moon seonmin with the best goal celebration in the league also put in a strong performance but has now signed for champions jeonbuk nam junjae returned in the summer to score some bangers costa rican international aguilar was also impressive but has signed for jeju in the new season\\n\\nsangju sangmu\\n\\nthe military team where other k league players get loaned to to complete their military service their history goes far back in one sense as various military teams were playing way back to the 50s but they were founded for pro footballers to serve their time only in 1984 although they were for pro players they competed in the semipro national league until 2003 when they joined the k league based in gwangju when gwangju fc were formed they moved to sangju\\n\\nsangju sangmu do not have any foreign players for obvious reasons and cannot compete in the champions league although the chances of ever finishing in a qualifying spot are fairly slim\\n\\nfc seoul\\n\\nfc seoul wow what happened having won the league in 2016 albeit somewhat fortuitously and always finishing in the top half if not competing for the title in the past decade nobody expected seoul to be fighting against relegation although relatively solid defensively they scored the least number of goals in the league season of all teams their star foreign players almost all left before the season started including dejan to rivals suwon and were not replaced with the same quality and for many matches seoul played with an allkorean team one bit of good news for the future is that former captain osmar will return from his loan to cezero osaka for the new season\\n\\nseoul at least managed to avoid relegation by beating busan ipark over two legs in the playoff helped by a red card in the first leg surprisingly they managed to score 3 goals in the first leg in open play\\n\\nseoul is probably the most popular club in korea im sure helped by the fact that it is the main club in a city of 10 million people  seoul generally has the highest game attendances although it was much reduced last season because they were so crap\\n\\nstarting out as luckygoldstar ie lg fc in chungcheong province the team was permitted to relocate to seoul at the start of the 90s and were renamed as lg cheetahs during the decentralisation period they moved to anyang modifying their name to anyang lg cheetahs

started when the head of the owner company that backed seongnam died in 2012 and the board were keen to let go of the club seongnam city government took over ownership of the club for the 2014 season

transfer market this winter window was no different with what i would say were the two biggest stories involving young homegrown korean talent going abroad\\n\\nthe first is that of jeonbuk and national team star centreback kim minjae nicknamed the monster there were rumours of an offer from english side watford but it wasnt clear if there ever was any offer or negotiations  kim himself said he did not know of any interest from watford it doesnt really matter now  kim signed with chinese side beijing sinobo guoan and will see champions league football with them in the new season being drawn in the same group as jeonbuk\\n\\nthe second is hwang inbeom who has signed for mls side vancouver whitecaps hwang inbeom played in k league 2 last season with asan mugunghwa and daejeon citizen but has impressed as a midfield playmaker and is currently seen as a replacement for ki sungyueng in the national team\\n\\nfor a recognisable name for western readers the best i have is englishman jordon mutch who signed for gyeongnam from crystal palace resulting in this awkward photo ophttpspbstwimgcommediadzg3adzvyaakrkqformatjpgnamemedium another recognisable name is mix diskerud on loan to ulsan from man city but he joined the previous year\\n\\nk league 1s top scorer marco left gyeongnam for hebei china fortune and his replacement is luc castaignos signed from sporting cp his stats in europe havent been great in recent years but he may fare better in korea\\n\\nthere were of course a few hundred domestic internal transfers and number of other foreign player signings  if you want the full list k league uniteds winter transfer trackerhttpwwwkleagueunitedcom2019012019kleaguewintertransfertrackerhtml has it all\\n\\n\\n\\nhistory of club football in korea  establishment of the k league\\n\\nassociation football was first introduced to korea in 1882 when british royal navy crew harboured at incheon played a game it wasnt until the 1900s that football began to take hold and the first public match was played in 1905 there was a boom in in the 1910s with a number of football clubs being formed and rivalries began to form between clubs in seoul and pyongyang\\n\\nthe first nationwide competition was the all joseon football tournament joseon being the name for korea at the time founded in 1921 there wasnt actually a champion crowned in 1921 as the tournament was cut short due to complaints over refereeing decisions all this was taking place during japanese occupation of korea during most of the first half of the 20th century\\n\\naccording to the kfahttpswebarchiveorgweb20170606162658httpkfaorkrrecordhistoryasp football was the only tonic that could relieve the the national resentment that had accumlated in the hearts as a colony under the japanese empire and was a sprout that could foster the hope of freedom a tad hyperbolic maybe\\n\\none side effect of being a japanese colony is that some korean teams were allowed to participate in the emperors cup japans fa cup and in 1935 kyungsung fc kyungsung was a name for seoul during japanese occupation won the tournament becoming the only nonjapanese team to ever do so\\n\\nthe all joseon football tournament ran until wwii\\n\\nafter wwii came korean independence and shortly thereafter the korean war there was football being played during this period continuously when possible the korean national semiprofessional football league was founded in 1964 and is the predecessor to todays tier 3 national league many of the teams during this period were works teams  employed by a company playing under the name of the company but also having a proper job in the company cha bumkun said by some to be the greatest ever asian footballer rose to fame during this period albeit mainly in the bundesliga starting his senior career at the mighty seoul trust bank fc the most astonishing statistic about cha bumkun is he only received one yellow card in his career\\n\\nfinally we get to the establishment of professional football with the korean super league in 1983 now named the k league initially there were only 5 teams and 2 of those teams dropped out within 2 years the number of clubs in the top flight has varied from the initial 5 to a high of 16 in 2011 in 2013 the k league split into two tiers now k league 1 and k league 2\\n\\nfor the first few years of the k league teams did not have a fixed home stadium that they played in because there was no standard homeaway format that we are so familiar with today instead it was operated as a national tour\\n\\nthe k league in the modern era has its own history but one of the most interesting events was the forced exodus of all three clubs from seoul in 1996 as part of a policy to spread the popularity of football around the country also with an eye on stadium infrastructure for the 2002 world cup two of the clubs didnt move far only just outside the city of seoul each to one of seouls satellite cities yukong elephants only halfleft because the city they moved to didnt have a stadium yet so they continued to play in seoul until a new stadium was built for a number of years the k league was without any seoul representation in 2004 after the need to find someone to fill a great big national football stadium and help pay towards it one of those relocated teams moved back to seoul becoming fc seoul\\n\\n\\n\\nfootball pyramid  league format\\n\\nthe current system looks like this\\n\\n\\n tier  league  notes \\n\\n 1  k league 1 12 teams 1 relegation to k league 2 1 relegation playoff with

 division 7 league 160 regional leagues with 960 teams some promotion with division 6 \\n\\nas you can see the naming is completely screwed up  k3 league occupies tiers 4 and 5 and division 5 is in tier 6 this is probably because the top tier k league only split in two in 2013 with the creation on k league 2 and nobodys been bothered to update their names\\n\\nthe national league sits stubbornly in tier 3 blocking any continuous prorel the powers that be have regularly stated that they want to reform the pyramid to have a continuous route from top to bottom at least to the bottom of k3 league within a few years but for some reason its not happening the winners of the 2006 national league season were offered promotion to the k league but they declined the offer the winners of the 2007 season were also offered promotion but declined again even though they said they would like promotion at the start of the season\\n\\none of the more recent additions to the k league bucheon fc 1995 joined from k3 league because they didnt want to pay the higher fees associated with starting out in the national league\\n\\noutside of this system there is the wk league the womens top tier the wk league has been dominated by incheon red angels no connection to incheon united in recent years theres no womens champions league in asia yet but for a few years in the past the winners of the wk

enter into the korean fa cup the route into a pro team in korea is often direct from high school or university teams something i dont think exists in europe some high school teams are even seen as feeder teams for a particular pro team i wont pretend to understand how the system works but ill leave you with the tidbit that park jisung was first signed to a professional team from a university team almost by accident as the scout had come to see a different player but took home park instead\\n\\nk league 1\\n\\nk league 1 consists of 12 teams playing 38 games the format is identical to the scottish premiership  all teams play each other three times and then after the split the top 6 and bottom 6 battle it out among themselves to settle the championship and relegation spots respectively the first tie breaker for teams level on points is goals scored rather than goal difference\\n\\nthe top 3 places offer a chance in the afc champions league the fourth champions league spot going to the winner of the korean fa cup bottom place gets relegated to k league 2 whilst 11th place has a playoff with one of the teams that finished 2nd4th in k league 2\\n\\ninternational context\\n\\nin the current format of the afc champions league the competition is split into a west region think uae saudi arabia qatar iran and an east region the east region is dominated by three nations  korea china and japan australia who decided it wanted to be asian earlier this century has also had a bit of success\\n\\nthis year there will be two debutants from korea  gyeongnam fc and daegu fc its dufficult to predict how well these two will fare but if they can carry some form over to this year they could get out of the group stages at least\\n\\ndetermining who has the strongest teams amongst the big three east asian nations is a difficult task and is hugely subjective im almost i say almost because obviously k league is best league of the opinion that theyre as close to equal as makes no difference korea has the most number of titles and the club with the most titles pohang steelers china have the highest coefficient japan has won the past two tournaments\\n\\nin recent years china and japan have had a number of big star foreigner signings eg paulinho torres which are absent from the k league i believe this is due to japan having cash mainly coming from tv money and china having cash from well being china despite korea lagging financially all three nations have the same limit on foreign players three foreigners plus one from another afc country and so korean teams are still competitive due to the relative strength of their domestic players\\n\\nwhile were on the topic of the champions league each of the big three east asian nations get 4 places total  2 or 3 to the group stages and 1 or 2 to the last qualifying playoff round before the group stages this playoff round is massively weighted in the big threes favour as they have to win just one home game when the weather is still genrally freezing cold against a team from a nation with a tropical climate i dont know of a korean club ever losing this playoff match\\n\\nthe afc cup is sometimes said to be the equivalent of uefas europa league but its not really comparable the afc cup is for the weaker asian nations only and korea arent allowed to enter\\n\\n\\n\\nresources\\n\\nwebsites  podcasts\\n\\nfor those of us

national broadcasters or streaming services around the world have k league rights but in korea itself essentially every thing is streamed on korean online behemoth navers platform the one caveat is that live streams are region locked so to access them youll need a vpn to get a korean ip address although some other asian countries also seem to have access i wont repeat what others have already

that would be fun places to go and cycle around over the occasional weekend\\n\\nour plan is to just toss our bikes on the earliest bus heading out towards whatever our destination would be and then bike around after arriving and just explore and soak in the sights likely would ride around 3040 km a day over 12 days\\n\\nive traveled outside of seoul a bit jeollado gangwondo jeonju nearby daejon

regions and i dont know them well enough to pin down smaller townsneighborhoods to focus on for such a trip\\n\\ni cant find any good resources for the answers im seeking as most of the english resources i came across just discuss the larger wellknown and wellworn trails and bike paths so i thought id turn to the community living here and see if anyone has any suggestions theyd like to share\\n\\nmy wife prefers to avoid riding along larger roads and both of us would like somewhere that isnt too heavy with traffic smaller towns are fine even better would be an area where we can hop between townsneighborhoods and get some country riding in were really doing this to just get out and explore some pretty areas that wed normally not visit and combining that with riding around as the

highest number of missionaries around the world how awesome is that and up until around 1800 they never had access to the gospel\\n\\nhow were they reached\\n\\ncatholicism was first introduced during the late joseon dynasty period by confucian scholars who encountered it in china in 1603 yi gwangjeong korean diplomat returned from beijing carrying several theological books written by matteo ricci an italian jesuit missionary to china he began disseminating the information in the books and the first seeds of christianity were sown in 1758 king yeongjo of joseon officially outlawed catholicism as an evil practice catholicism was reintroduced in 1785 by yi seunghun and since then french and chinese catholic priests were invited by the korean christians  \\n  \\njoseon royalty saw the new religion as a subversive influence and persecuted its earliest followers in korea culminating in the catholic persecution of 1866 in which 8000 catholics across the country were killed including nine french missionary priests the opening of korea to the outside world in the late nineteenth century brought religious toleration for the remaining catholics and also introduced protestantism via american missionaries beginning in 1884 the first protestant church in korea was established by seo sangryun and the first protestant missionary to enter korea was horace newton allen both events occurring in 1884 horace allen was a north presbyterian missionary who became an american diplomat he served in korea until 1905 by which time he had been joined by many others  \\n  \\nthe growth of both denominations was gradual before 1945 in that year approximately 2 of the population was christian rapid growth ensued after the war when korea was freed from japanese occupation by the allies by 1991 184 of the population 80 million was protestant and 67 25 million was catholic wikipediahttpsenwikipediaorgwikichristianityinkorea\\n\\nand then this\\n\\nthe christian missionaries who arrived in the 1800s and following have contributed much to the health education and general wellbeing of the south koreans christians were vocal in their support of the liberation of the korean peninsula

conveniences of the modern world high rates of cable andor satellite television usage and highspeed internet connectivity make south korean a member of the cutting edge technology users of the world the country is also credited with pioneering the television via mobile devices and internet revolution  \\n  \\ndistinct regional differences in culture and politics exist among the south koreans the most important regional difference is between the gyeongsang region in the southeast and the jeolla region in the southwest the two regions maintain a rivalry that reaches back to the fourth century ad the rivalry originated from a struggle for control of the peninsula interregional marriages are rare and travel between the regions in sparce despite a major highway connecting the regions since 1984 constructed for the specific reason of increasing interregional travel the highway has not served to improve visitation or commerce between the regions  \\n  \\nthe political power elite have come largely from the gyeongsang region and consequently this region has benefitted most from government development assistance in contrast the jeolla region has remained comparatively rural and undeveloped  \\n  \\nregional stereotypes like regional dialects have been breaking down under the influence of centralized education nationwide media and several decades of population movement since

begins with the founding of joseon also known as gojoseon or old joseon to differentiate it with the 14th century dynasty in 2333\\xa0bce by dangun according to koreas foundation mythology gojoseon was noted in chinese records in the early 7th century gojoseon expanded until it controlled the northern korean peninsula and parts of manchuria gija joseon was purportedly founded in the 12th century bce but its existence and role have been controversial in the modern era in 108 bce the han dynasty defeated wiman joseon and installed four commanderies in the northern korean peninsula three of the commanderies fell or retreated westward within a few decades as lelang commandery was destroyed and rebuilt around this time the place gradually moved toward liaodong thus\\xa0its force was diminished

up for a while but never really found the energy today i got really so annoyed with one of busans unis so rather than fume over it i figure id use the energy in writing an information post so that no one will ever have to suffer like i am suffering right now this post deals with how to apply to summer programs at universities in korea and will be divided into two parts 1 what type of program are you looking for and 2 which regionuniversity should you choose\\n\\nnote i attended yonsei li attending pknu li waseda li\\n\\nfurther note those who are here for normal language programs scroll down to language institute and start reading from there\\n\\nnbsp\\n\\n1 what type of program are you looking for summer school v language institute\\none university can and usually does run two types of summer programs \\n\\n\\nnbsp\\n\\nsummer school\\nthe first type of program are a mix of general education korean culture and a bit of korean language curriculum summer school these schools usually have a slew of englishtaught programs to choose from culture in korea business in modern society etc and are extremely foreignerfriendly they provide dormitories and catered food in the dormitories there is usually a barrage of field trips and summer buddies available fun fact usually a few months before the program the school will send out a flyer to recruit summer buddies from the existing university students eager to practice their english they will have fun activities kpop dance cooking in korea taekwondo available these programs usually incorporate a threehour language class in the morning tailored for beginners and lowintermediates  \\n\\nnbsp\\n\\ni would reccommend these programs for people who\\n\\n dont mind paying a bit more money for safety and certainty\\n want to make friends hang out in the city in a primarily englishspeaking environment\\n hate uncertainty\\n\\nnbsp\\n\\nif you are applying to a summer school congratulations it is extremely easy to apply for a summer school most universities have a separate portal run exclusively in english for these schools and you should have almost no difficulty in locating the relevant portal i suggest using keywords like uni name international summer school a quick search using those terms gives me yonsei international summer school pnu summer school immediately \\n\\nnbsp\\n  \\nyou must start checking these portals around january of the year that you wish to apply the programs will only upload concrete details around january if you want information earlier you can email the contact persons or you can look at previous years there is usually a 20 early bird discount applications proper can open as early as april and end as late as end may there is sometimes a discount up to 2030 for returning students students of alumni etc\\n\\nnbsp\\n  \\nthese courses appeared to be targeted at rich foreigners the prices all appear in usd so its extremely worthwhile to check out the discounts i reccommend summer schools for those younger students 18ish especially this is a very safe environment you will have relatively good english staff support and you are likely to make friends more easily this is probably also more fun for the clubberstravellers who are just looking for a fun time in korea with korean culture\\n\\n\\nnbsp\\n\\n\\nlanguage institute\\nthe second type of program is the korean language program im going to be extremely accurate here and say that most universities actually offer four different types of summer programs which can be divided into summer school 1 korean language 3\\n\\n summer school 4  6 weeks as discussed above\\n regular summer 10 weeks  usually taken by students as part of their spring fall winter course but outsiders like us can also apply most of these institutes also run spring summer fall winter courses these course are usually 10 weeks long and these are the hardest of hardcore students these students usually have been accepted to enter a korean university and before uni they are doing a course in the affiliated korean language institute branch to get fluency i hear that busan is flooded with chinese especially on this course the application period for this is very strict and starts the earliest among all summer programs usually march \\n special summer a 3  6 weeks usually targeted at us foreigners who want to be in korea for a decently long while but still have to go back to school in our home countries this is the program i will be addressing in this entire section on language institutes\\n special summer b 2 weeks i forgot about this one when i wrote my original post usually this is for foreigners who are having a short stay in korea and want a fair mix of korean language korean culture and field tripping around the city dorms catering solid korean buddies are provided when it says two weeks its more like starts on a tuesday ends on the next friday so maybe 10 days sometimes i can admit that its a bit of a money squeezer but its worthwhile if you want to visit the university have a fun studentlike experience and leave if youre a casual tourist this is probably too restrictive for you as there are strict program timings and dorm curfew this might be good for potential students who want to get a taste of the university i will not be specifically targeting this program in my post however most of the points about special summer a are relatively applicable to b\\n\\nnbsp\\n\\nhere are the various combinations for the special summer a and b programs\\n\\n uni only offers special summer a they only offer a long special summer course\\n uni only offers special summer b they only offer a short special summer course\\n uni offers both special summer a and b types yonsei and ewha did to my knowledge both special summer a and b are parked under the language institute branch they can be run concurrently ie at the same time but it will be two very different programs special summer b will focus more on going out and seeing the city and offering field trips it will be also slightly more expensive the more wellknown schools usually offer this program and its very common in seoul i havent seen this dual a and b combination in busanelsewhere they will stick to offering a single special summer course\\n\\nnbsp\\n\\nhonestly can you see why its so frustrating to be very fair the variety of choice was good for me because i had a very strict calendar budget list of approved schools list of neighborhoods i wanted to be in so i did enjoy picking through the combinations to see what works best however the variety advantage is far outweighed by the sheer amount of bloody effort it is to extract this information from each university youre looking for the language site then looking to see if there are different programs then comparing costs and timings across the programs then remember that all this information is usually higgeldypiggeldy everywhere you have to piece it together there is no sweet and simple comparison table\\n\\nnbsp\\n\\nstill my advice is to do your research and post it on reddit after please for the love of everything yonsei was literally amazing it can be quite worthwhile to put in the effort to understand what youre signing up for and hey ive already saved you like 70 of the agonising pain which is figuring out that a single school can run up to four different summer programs all the best guys\\n\\nnbsp\\n\\nspecial summer a\\n\\nokay i will now continue talking about special summer a this program is just hardcore learning korean the nicer universities yonsei will have 4 hour korean classes in the morning 9am  1pm leaving your afternoons free for exploring the others will have legitimate 6 hour korean classes 9am  12pm 2pm  5pm and you will have the nights for yourself the universities usually throw in the fortnightly cultural activity pottery kpop dance and a single field trip\\n\\nnbsp\\n\\ni would reccommend this program to people who\\n\\n really are studying korean\\n are comfortable hanging out with gyopos\\n are okay with endless crying uncertainty fear and doubt constant regret or have parents that speak korean\\n\\nnbsp\\n\\nif you are applying for this program gird yourself this will be one of the worst experiences of your life this is like choosing a university but all the universities have pages in a foreign language and all the sites are hiddenbrokenare listed on google as a malicious site that will steal your data it is almost impossible to find out who to contact for assistance and you must wait three weeks for the reply\\n\\nnbsp\\n\\nhow do you find the korean language program the easiest way is as follows\\n\\n first find the name of the summer school program you now know what you are not looking for \\n now google any combination of uni name international summer korean language institute a quick search gives me yonsei kli and leipusan fifth result and the website title is not in english you will have to search hard these institutes usually have a facebook page their names are sometimes cited in official tourism boards and they have a website name that will include the university name follow your instincts and just keep clicking on anything that gives you korean language institute\\n and now the difficult part you have managed to find out the language institute sites of three different universities for comparison how do you locate the actual program\\n\\nnbsp\\n\\nthis differs from site to site try headers like summer special program korean language special program there is usually a feed of announcements think of a very sterile clean wall of single line announcements somewhere you are looking for an announcement which says somewhere summer special program 2018 open the official facebook group of the institute is also a pretty good bet they will usually post the program details there\\n\\nnbsp\\n\\nthis is especially tricky because often these announcements are in korean sometimes there will be two separate feeds one in english and one in korean the english one will almost always have some announcements missing the feed will also have a majority of announcements for regular summer classes\\n\\nnbsp\\n\\nyou will want to pull out information from the previous years because the time cost and program will roughly follow the same pattern theres usually a 20 early bird discount and further discounts for alumni returning students etc email the course coordinator if you have doubts there is no better source of information than the person organising this program the course coordinator may not be fluent in english so use simple english and make sure to attach links of previous years programs so the coordinator knows exactly which course you are refering to again this information for previous programs will be found mainly on the facebook and the announcement feed but will usually be scattered around like birdseed google sometimes turns up good results for me \\n\\nnbsp\\n\\nbut great news when you find the information you want its always in pdf format usually in four versions chinese japanese english korean so just keep scrolling down and clearly lists out accomodation catering day to day program this is basically the motherlode this is your guide to everything you just need to find this pdf\\n\\nnbsp\\n\\napplication time when do applications start usually the information comes out january  february applications are in may again email the course coordinator if you have any doubts\\n\\nnbsp\\n\\ni reccommend this program for people interested in korean language for real fun fact because the barrier to finding this forsaken program is so high i feel that most people you meet here are really interested in korean language and will have some background in it or they are rich children of gyopos overseas koreans usually american gyopos and they didnt want to attend the course but their mother signed them up for it they easily speak conversational korean at home but may not be able to readwrite korean \\n\\nnbsp\\n\\nit happened that i made more friends with the more wealthy kids so i can talk more about that set honestly the people you meet are quite fun even the ones i wasnt close to they were really interesting and theyd know the best places yeah my aunt told me where to eat or have relatives staying in jeju and would be planning a trip there and theyre really comfortable ordering food and shopping and all theres a fair mix of the clubbers the intense kpoppers hi thats me the studious students the holiday rich kids etc the teachers are usually great too because they know that we wanna learn koreanare already fluent in korean so the joking and classroom activity is rowdy and fun i loved it made two of my best friends there and we had the kind of fun that you can only have when you speak literally the worst mangled korean and you actually can read and do normal stuff that tourists dont because language \\n\\nnbsp\\n\\nalright ill do a quick rundown of the different schools seoul busan others i just had my lunch so now lets dive right back into\\n\\nnbsp\\n\\n2 which regionuniversity should you choose seoul v busan v others\\n\\nas a rule summer school is its own kettle of fish and has its separate site which i will identify as eg

language institute sites are accurate this is because the kli sites are really hard to find and sometimes change addresses please confirm with your own efforts\\n\\nfurther disclaimer this is not an exhaustive list there are more universities in korea that offer such programs there are also privately run language institutes ie not universities these are forprofit independent language centers which offer programs im just listing the ones i feel are the most common\\n\\nnbsp\\n\\nwhy should you pick seoul\\ni love seoul i wrote poems to seoul at 2am in the night seoul never sleeps the shopping the shopping is actually insane the kpop if youre coming here to try and watch a concert or any other kpoprelated thing come to seoul amusement parks no beaches if you want beaches busan relatively great cultural experiences food is pretty diverse although i hear that the southwest region of jeolla compared to the northwest region of seoul has the best food in korea likeminded friends hongdae i mean most of you will go to seoul and youre absolutely right just go\\n\\nnbsp\\n\\nwhich university should you pick in seoul\\nthe first thing you need to do is to plot out on a map where all the universities are in seoul then plot out on the same map where the major entertainment districts are think about what you want if you want a intensely strong clubbing partying fun vibe you should locate yourself in what i labelled above as the hongdae sector five  ten minutes from hongdae basically anywhere near insadong is more cultural fun its got great food tea houses youre relatively close by the palaces theater disctrict and shopping district myeongdong i hear that hanyang is good if you want to hang out in gangnam for the uninitiated gangnam and hongdae which are the two biggest party districts are about 1 hour  apart from each other by train so you will have to pick one to live in \\n\\nnbsp\\n\\ni want to do a quick disclaimer on my mountains of nowheres the kodae mountain of nowhere anam is actually a rather nice university district which is a halfhour or so ride from gangnam one of my friends wanted to go to a famous dance studio near kodae so she picked kodae instead i have not visited snu to my limited knowledge the snu mountain of nowhere is actually a mountain and it really is in the middle of nowhere i do hear that the sk universities have a good campus vibe personally it just wasnt the thing i was looking out for but it might be for some of you\\n\\nnbsp\\n\\nwhich university has good quality teaching i suggest you click around reddit for personal experiences and reviews i have only been to yonsei so i can only feedback on yonsei i adored yonsei but i had the luck of getting the head of the department to teach my class i selfstudy a lot so i was pickier about my social surroundings than the quality of the lessons \\n\\nnbsp\\n\\nmy opinion handsdown yonsei i wanted to go to a sky university for the branding i wanted to be pretty near social life i did consider ewha but i thought there would be a lot of guys applying to ewha to meet girls girls only school if branding is not important to you i suggest that you click around the nonsky universities because they usually are cheaper and still welllocated i did tons of research on at least eleven of the seoul universities even though i was quite sure it was going to be yonsei because i needed to justify why i was picking yonsei to my sponsor dont limit yourself\\n\\nnbsp\\n\\nand thats it for seoul\\n\\n\\n\\nnbsp\\n\\nbusan\\n\\nbusan list\\n\\nnbsp\\nnorth

different devices never wait for the problem to solve itself because it wont try and find another way into the site\\n\\nnbsp\\n\\nwhy should you pick busan\\nokay like this is completely a personal preference but im dead for the busan accent that is literally my reason numbers 1 through 5 other than that busans got good seafood beautiful sunny beaches if you want to take a trip to jeju its very convenient busan has a lot of political and historical seriously im a bit of a nerd and it is considerable significance its near the ancient palaces up in gyeongju mainly the accent\\n\\nnbsp\\n\\nremember that busan is 5 hours away from seoul and expensive so if you want to spend most of your time in seoul base yourself in seoul dont imagine that youll be taking the train up and down your friends may not want to and youll end up going alone \\n\\nnbsp\\n\\nwhich university should you pick in busan\\nits basically a tossup between pnu and pknu if youre going on exchange i hear donga is also an option and its a nice clean university town pnu is a bit too far up for me pknu to me is perfectly located ill come back and update about what to do in busan once ive finished attending 2018 pknu summer hit me up via private message if youre taking that course too\\n\\n\\nnbsp\\n\\nothers\\n\\n kaist summer school in daejeon httpsummerkaistackr\\n chonbuk national university in jeolla\\n others\\n\\nnbsp\\n\\nshould you pick universities outside of seoul and busan\\nif you are interested yes the other two i have briefly considered are kaist for its ranking which i quickly dropped because the program doesnt focus on language it focuses on math and science and chonbuk national uni purely because i considered picking up the jeolla accent just for kicks and because i wanted to eat jeollas food but i think i found out chonbuk doesnt offer the summer timing i wanted\\n\\nnbsp\\n\\nif you have a specific accent or institution that you have interest in of course you should take a look i sincerely doubt that people will be looking outside of seoul and busan but i want to reassure the people who are looking for a comprehensive guide to summer school  yes it really is mostly about seoul and busan and i think thats all let me know if any of the links should be updated in the comments below'}, {'title': 'faith online debut showcase interview',

me\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nlj thanks a lot ayuni thanks you too girls alright its time to look at your new journey as faith can the leader introduce faith to us\\xa0\\n\\njl yes this is the leader julia faith is a vocal girl group consisting of us five members julia elisah harini jihye and ayuni and our concept is a more mature a little bit oldschool style unnielike and cool vocal group through our songs and our appearance we want people of all ages to remember groups in the 2000s who were not just pretty girls who sang and danced but also excelled at it and were all round entertainers beloved by everyone motioning to lee jin such as finkl sunbaenim for example\\xa0\\n\\nlj smiles thats so sweet of you thank you so much it makes me happy to see children born after we debuted still remember us alright what are your strengths as a group and individually yes elisah\\n\\nes yes elisah here as a group our strength are our vocals all 5 of us have distinct vocal colours and we harmonise well and create good synergy with each other while singing all five of us are very strong with our singing none of us here are bad even our weakest one ayuni can be first lead vocalist or second main main vocalist in any other group\\n\\nlj i see thats great you mentioned vocal colours which im sure we will see soon in the performance of your debut song do you mind introducing each members vocal and their colour\\n\\nes sure julia unnie has a voice which can be described with the colour dark purple she carries a lot of emotions with her heavy voice be it heartbreak motivation or girlyness because she is trained in rnb and vocal music she also has a distinct way of singing that reminds you of the olden days but still sounds very fresh today in fact she trained in america unnie and me met at the training facility in la actually\\xa0\\n\\nmy voice can be described with the colour blue its very refreshing easy going and is like a girl crush type i am also someone who can take on many voices to adjust to each song my training has been in pop songs since the beginning and i used to be in church choir\\xa0 \\n\\nharini has a very deep and heavy voice i would describe as the colour dark red while we were trainees we were joking that even when she sings a childrens song its like shes enchanting someone her background is in traditional indonesian music so she sometimes teaches us new vocal techniques they bring a lot of variety into our singing\\xa0 \\n\\njihye has a voice that suits the colour yellow she is right now in college majoring in contemporary classical music she is a soprano with a voice thats perfect for musicals her voice is very light sunny and she can carry a lot of emotions she was actually casted while practicing an aria\\xa0 \\n\\nayuni has a voice i can describe with light pink not as pink as a babys but pink enough to be girlish you know ayuni is from japan where many female singers have a kawaii style compared to them ayuni sounds very husky and girl crush but with us who have strong voices she sounds kawaii laughs she is the key to our balance in vocals and harmonies she can be powerful and cute at the same time\\xa0\\n\\nlj well said elisah you seem to be good at speaking\\xa0\\n\\nel thank you so much\\xa0\\n\\nlj as elisah said your strength is vocals jihye what else do you want to stand out with\\xa0\\n\\njh yes this is jihye while many girl groups nowadays focus on showing off their style dancing and the performance we want to focus on our singing and reach out to all audiences through the stage also there are a lot of underage young idols debuting recently our maknae ayuni has turned 19 this year we wanted to make sure all of us are old enough to not only be responsible idols but also members of the society yeah we are idols but we all pay taxes laughs\\xa0\\n\\nlj i hope you all do for many years to come now im curious to know the meaning of your groups name faith in korean that would translate to  what is the meaning behind it yes harini\\n\\nhr umm yes this is harini we chose the english name faith for different reasons one its to symbolise that people can trust us when it comes to delivering a good performance and being good entertainers two the roots of vocal groups like us lie in gospel soul jazz and rnb music which came from churches in america through our name faith we want to pay a tribute to the origins\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nlj thank you harini if i may ask you girls  are any of you christian\\n\\nel jl jh raise hands\\xa0\\n\\nlj oh correct elisah you had mentioned you sang in the church choir harini and ayuni if you are fine with answering are you religious\\xa0\\n\\nhr im hindu in indonesia there are a lot of hindus\\xa0\\n\\nay im atheist i have not been raised with any religion sunbaenim are you religious\\n\\nlj me im christian nice of you to ask on to the next question right for you ayuni you mentioned you were in charge of japanese elisah mentioned you came from japan did you have difficulties with adjusting to korean culture\\n\\nay yes this is ayuni i actually have come from japan i was born and brought up there but im korean by blood im a 3rd generation zainichi korean 3  my korean name is shin ayooni      \\xa0  tn  clear beautiful a gentle tender yoo girl child ni in japanese its kamishiraishi masayuki my greatgrandparents came to japan during the war and my grandparents made sure we dont lose our korean roots despite the discrimination we celebrated chuseok and wore hanbok for any festivities played yutnoli and called each other unnie and hyung we learnt to read korean newspapers and had contact with our korean cousins a lot and went to our hometown for holidays in that way coming to korea felt like me finally coming home to the place where i belong more than adjusting to a foreign culture\\xa0\\n\\nlj oh i didnt know that you were a korean by blood apologies if my question made you feel like a foreigner\\xa0\\n\\nay its not a problem in fact i do consider myself a foreigner to seoul because i didnt grow up here and dont know the system in such a big city here i was born and brought up in fukuoka which is a small town compared to seoul or tokyo the first time i travelled in the seoul subway i was supposed to end up in apgujeongdong but ended up somewhere in sillimdong laughs\\n\\nlj well i hope youre feeling more familiar in seoul now we do have an actual foreigner here  harini over to you how did you first hear about the korean idol industry and how was it for you coming to korea\\xa0\\n\\nhr harini speaking i first heard about the idol industry at a young age  actually our family has been watching korean entertainment since a long time my family watched actress song hyekyo and actor lee minhos dramas my elder siblings listened to super junior and juwelry for me i became interested after seeing 2ne1 kara and big bang sunbaenim in 2009 when i was just 9 i also remember hearing about tara snsd after school and 4minute for us in indonesia apart from our local entertainment we watch a lot of international content dramas from turkey movies from india songs from korea so as a child that was good at dancing i naturally felt attracted to the korean idol world and dreamt of doing it myself\\n\\nas for the second question the hardest thing was the excuse me i cant find th word not the weather but\\n\\nlj climate\\n\\nhr yes thank you climate i saw my first ever snow here in korea its really impressive like in the dramas but also really cold ive never worn a thick jacket or mittens in my life until i came here yeah that was the hardest part\\xa0\\n\\nlj youll get used to it dont worry elisah on to you youre koreanamerican right how did you feel coming here\\xa0\\n\\nel yes this is elisah i grew up in la where there is a very big korean community i was able to stay in touch with korean culture but as ayuni said living in seoul is different from visiting for a holiday for me more than adjusting i really wanted to blend in as much as i could so i learnt things like slang quicker its\\xa0 because in america i felt like im an outsider because i looked asian so didnt want to be an outsider here too my korean name is choi sunah so i used to introduce myself like that when i came here first i wanted to feel as korean as possible even at the company i used that name i met the members as choi sunah they thought elisah is a stage name chuckles but its my birth name\\xa0\\n\\nlj youve got really pretty names both western and korean be proud of it you know you have a special privilege of understanding both countries and cultures itll be valuable to you one day believe me i felt like saying this because i know a lot of people like you i live in america currently you know\\xa0\\n\\nel oh you do thats so sweet of you sunbaenim thank you so much\\xa0\\n\\nlj my pleasure sunahyah laughs moving on we have the korean js  jihye and julia looking at how impatient jihye is giggling jihye lets start with you this question is for you you are currently majoring in classical music why did you decide to join the idol world\\xa0\\n\\njh yes this is jihye i feel like by joining the idol industry i have the power to directly influence people more than as a soprano ive always wanted to connect to different people and learn more about the world and i feel like despite my training being meant for different purposes i can grow much more as a person if im an idol than when id be on stage as a soprano i also always had a forbidden love for hip hop but ill make sure to practice a lot of soprano vocals too especially musicals julia unnie is obsessed with them\\n\\nlj thanks for the good transition jihye because this question for julia might go into the similar direction  julia you mentioned that you wanted to be all rounder entertainers what are your goals and aspirations in the wider entertainment field\\n\\njl yes this is julia is this for all the members aspirations or just mine\\xa0\\n\\nlj just yours\\xa0\\n\\njl well for one apart from singing which is obviously my strength i feel like id do good on variety shows im good at telling stories in general and a lot of funny jazz has gone down in my life\\n\\nlj sorry for the interruption but im too curious to not ask this  are you from jeolla province by any chance going by your word choice\\n\\njl yes i am i grew up in the outskirts of gwangju i have a very heavy satoori right i think i should switch to standard language\\n\\nlj oh no im sorry dont hide it its really charming and suits you a lot i was just curious to know because i thought you were from seoul at first\\xa0\\n\\njl i do means ive adjusted well back to the question i recently am obsessed with musicals and act them out with jihye a lot i actually majored in applied vocal music so i cant wait until i feel im good enough to audition and find a career in musicals\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nlj i hope to see you on stage soon another question to you julia as the leader what is one good and one not so good thing about the members when it comes to working together\\n\\njl julia speaking one good thing is that all 5 of us always know how to talk when we have any problems or difficulties we dont endure it quietly but speak up and solve it together and that makes our teamwork strong but one bad thing is that all the girls here including me put the team before themselves unconditionally that in itself is not a bad thing but it sometimes cane at the cost of their health that should not happen health is the most important thing and its ok to not be with the group once\\n\\nlj well said i hope the members take good care of themselves i have a question to the maknae ayuni where would you like to see faith in lets say 5 years\\n\\nay ayuni here i would like to see faith winning a music show broadcast and winning an award i want us to have nice fans from all age groups and nationalities i would love to not only promote in japan indonesia and us where our members are from but also in other places like europe hong kong and so on\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nlj alright thank you before we come to your debut song let me give you the opportunity to say your thanks to whomever you feel like saying it from the leader on please\\xa0\\n\\njl julia here first of all id like to thank my parents for believing and trusting me to take this career path our ceo who is also our pdnim who is not only kind but gave us a lot of freedom and made sure to listen to each of us she encouraged us and treated us and our staff like her own family\\xa0\\n\\nel i

but it was always so nice to hear little words of encouragement whenever you stopped by its em really a honour to have a member of finkl be the mc for our showcase and yeah thanks for being so kind and making us feel so comfortable when youre around i was actually so nervous that i took a pill before going on stage but i think that was not at all necessary\\xa0\\n\\nlj blushes you girls are so lovable really thanks a lot jihye smiles at her im so happy you are debuting ill definitely be your first fan oh im feeling a bit emotional now it reminds me of my girl group days lets continue ayuni\\n\\nay right jihye actually stole my words i felt like saying thanks to you too you were someone we looked up to a lot\\n\\nlj oh come on i dont deserve this\\n\\naylaughs i would especially like to thank our ceo for allowing us to have as much creative control over ourselves she sat with us and for two weeks and talked about everything and let us do the stage design choose the song design our clothes weve designed the outfits were wearing right now for the showcase ourselves yeah i think theyve come out well\\xa0\\n\\nlj really wow im impressed these clothes are so nice if id have known id have asked you to explain them because especially harinis and julias outfits stand out would you be fine if we did that after your song performance\\xa0\\n\\njl girls what do you say sure we will do that\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nlj alright lets talk about you song and album now who will introduce the song yes julia\\xa0\\n\\njl julia here our song is an energetic pop rock song called yeah with motivational uplifting lyrics and powerful vocals it sounds like the beloved pop rock tracks of the 2000s like kim ahjoongs maria or cherry filters flying duck i hope people will love yeah just like these songs are loved\\xa0\\n\\nlj thank you julia elisah would you like to introduce the album\\xa0\\n\\nel yes elisah here our album is named blind faith which means trusting someone without thinking yourself its a signal to blindly trust us and listen to our album its a full album with fourteen songs ranging from ballads to hip hop songs all these songs have in common that they are reminiscent of music in the 2000s it might sound like theyre out of style but they have a 2021 flavour to them too\\xa0\\n\\nlj thanks elisah ayuni whats a special point to look out for in the album\\xa0\\n\\nay ayuni here one point is that we all wrote the lyrics for chase which is actually a remake of an anime ost the lyrics are in korean japanese english and bahasa indonesia indonesian language another point to look out for is the song blind faith and the song girls on top which is also a remake of boa sunbaenims song these are old school hip hop dance and rap song where lisa unnie harini unnie and i can show off our rap and our dancing while in yeah butterfly thousand days towards me and in other tracks jihye unnie and julia unnie lead us with their vocals\\xa0\\n\\nlj thank you jihye which was the hardest song to record on the album\\xa0\\n\\njh jihye here the hardest song was girls on top and one more time ok my voice is very pure and uplifting it was hard to make it sound mature and sexy in a way because i had never donr it before i was even ready to have no lines but harini unnie and julia unnie helped me a lot with it\\xa0\\n\\nlj believe me all you need for being sexy is your confidence thats it dont worry if i could do it back in the day you can too we were also given mature concepts that only two members fit and me and the maknae had to oh im sorry i dont think latteneun maliya tn back in my days stories are fit in here\\xa0\\n\\njh its ok sunbaenim you can tell me later\\xa0\\n\\nhr wait did you say tell me why not tell us huh\\xa0\\n\\njh stuttering no unnie no like that\\n\\nlj laughs harini you dont need my advice and tips on how to be sexy you already are thats why\\n\\nhr taken aback blushes oh um thanks sunbaenim everybody laughs\\n\\nlj winks at jihye well now that we have this out of the way harini what for you is the most memorable song from the album\\xa0\\n\\nhr yeah harini here for me the most memorable one is chasebecause i got to wrote lyrics in bahasa indonesia for it another memorable song is towards me because i have as good as no lines laughs my voice doesnt really suit the song at all so i was fine with getting no lines i got a lot in one more time ok and midsummer nights dream and i harmonise a lot in the other songs\\n\\nlj alright were curious to listen to the album are you ready to sing your

ipark  \\n seongnam fc were promoted from k league 2  \\n ulsan won their champions league playoff and are in the group stages\\n\\nits impossible to write a concise summary of the 2018 season  you can get some of the details from the club guide below  but one of the most interesting stories actually comes from k league 2\\n\\nfor context you need to understand a bit about military service for footballers rather than take 2 years out of their career to serve in the military or do some kind of eg desk job service players can join one of two military football teams that play in the k league in k league 1 there is sangju sangmu and in k league 2 there is asan mugunghwa every player in these two teams is on loan for two years from another club in the k league sangju sangu is affiliated with the normal military whilst asan mugunghwa is affiliated with the police serving in the auxilliary police force is another way to do your service\\n\\nthe korean government recently decided to abolish the auxilliary police force by 2023 the police however decided to already wind down their sports teams putting an immediate halt on recruiting players and disbanding the teams in 2019\\n\\nnow the champions of k league 2 last season were asan mugunghwa they were in line for direct promotion to k league 1 to compete in the k league you need to have at least 20 players but by the time the next season started asan would only have 14 players as the loan deals ran out the league gave asan a deadline in november to submit a recruitment plan which they failed to do and so the promotion spot passed to secondplaced seongnam fc although that deadline and hence promotion was missed asan have how submitted a recruitment plan that would see their 14 serving players be supplemented by new signings that indicates the club will transition to an cityowned club with the help of the asan government\\n\\nfunnily or depressingly this is not the first time police fc won k league 2 and missed out on promotion  in 2016 ansan mugunghwa were crowned champions but at the end of that year moved from ansan to asan in line with the leagues policies they were registered as a brand new club\\n\\nk league 1 club guide\\n\\nclubs can have up to three foreign players in their squad plus an extra one from another afc nation although rare a player with north korea citizenship is not considered foreign most of those foreign places are taken by brazilians or players from the former yugoslavia eg k league veteran dejan damjanovic the exception to the foreigner rule is the goalkeeper  korean goalkeepers in the 90s were just so bad that a block on recruiting foreign goalieshttpwwwkleagueunitedcom201703foreigngoalkeepersinfavourofhtml was put in place to help encourage development of domestic talent it seems to have worked with korean goalkeepers often being signed abroad in asia at least\\n\\nthere is also a requirement to have u23 players fielded and on the bench with a failure to meet this impacting the number of substitutes that can be made article 30httpswwwkleaguecomaboutcompetition of the league rules\\n\\nyoull notice some of the clubs have a korean chaebol in their team name and even if its not in the name they may still be owned by a corporation behind the scenes this sounds very odd if youre not familiar with it but it is extremely common in japan china and korea it may just be a symptom of some of the teams being relatively recentlyfounded and perhaps isnt that unusual these days think red bull city group majority shareholders in the west however the number of citizen clubs owned by the local city or provincial government is on the rise  gyeongnam fc is one example\\n\\na lot of clubs probably like to think they have a derby with fc seoul because well its seoul but the  biggest and probably considered the national derby is the super match  between fc seoul and suwon samsung bluewings montenegrin damjanovic known simply as dejan formerly of seoul and now playing for suwon is the top scorer in this fixture\\n\\nheres the clubs by last seasons standing and since crests are a bit unstable on reddit at the moment heres an imgur album of all club crests and corresponding home kits for the 2019 seasonhttpimgurcomaw8dbla5\\n\\njeonbuk hyundai motors\\n\\njeonbuk are the dominant team in korea and one the of the teams you dont want to face in the champions league whoever you are theyve now won 4 out of the last 5 k league 1 titles and a most recent champions league title in 2016\\n\\ntheir rise to power over the last decade has been overseen by long term manager choi kanghee choi left at the end of last season to tianjin quanjintianhai daliang yifang fc in china korea seems to have a thing for portuguese managers these days and his replacement is one jos morais morais was assistant manager to jos mourinho for a period but as manager proper hes been a bit shit he was at two clubs in 2018 which included ushering barnsley into relegation to english league one how jeonbuk will fare after choi remains to be seen\\n\\nalthough jeonbuk cruised to the league title it would be difficult to call their season an outright success due to a horrendous 15 mins at the end of the second half in a home match against suwon in the champions league quarterfinal they turned the 3 goal deficit around in the seond leg when they travelled to suwon but went out on penalties \\n\\ngyeongnam fc\\n\\ngyeongnam were only promoted from k league 2 the previous season so coming second in k league 1 is something special top scorer in the league marco played his part with 26 goals\\n\\ngyeongnam will now feature in the champions league for the first time i thought that seems to have put the brakes on too many of their players departing but captain choi youngjun signed for jeonbuk in the winter transfer window a major loss is marco who was also top scorer in k league 2 in the year they were promoted who appears to have followed the money to china also off to china is key centreback park jisoo so basically the backbone of the team from defence to attack has left\\n\\nulsan hyundai\\n\\nknown as the horangi   the tigers  ulsan have had intermittent success in asia winning the champions league for the first and only time in 2012 in an unbeaten run\\n\\ntowards the end of the 2018 season ulsan were battling gyeongnam for the second spot which brings with it direct qualification to the champions league group stages rather than having a playoff they lost out but were widely expected to secure a direct qualification spot anyway when they faced daegu fc in the fa cup final ultimately they finished the season on a low losing 51 on aggregate to daegu in the final \\n\\npohang steelers\\n\\none of the few clubs that predates the formation of the k league pohang are another of the historical korean powerhouses they hold the record for the most number of champions league title 3 but their last title came in 2009\\n\\nfinishing fourth in the league they were hoping that ulsan would beat daegu in the fa cup final to pass their champions league spot on down but it didnt happen\\n\\njeju united\\n\\none of the original members of the k league founded as the yukong elephants in the seoul area as part of the decentralisation program they moved to bucheon kind of and were renamed as bucheon sk the decision to move to jeju in 2006 was an abrupt one and understandably deeply unpopular with the fans teams uprooting and moving elsewhere is a bit of a catalyst for the creation of new teams in korea and the fans formed bucheon fc 1995 in the absence of bucheon sk\\n\\nthe reason given for the relocation was to the address the imbalance in football teams being located around seoulgyeonggido and jeju did not have a pro team at the time but there are suggestions the owners sk group wanted to cut their investment and recoup some costs\\n\\nthere were recent rumours that jeju would move yet again back north to yongin but who knows \\n\\njeju had a pretty mediocre season what more can i say\\n\\nsuwon samsung bluewings\\n\\nsuwons 2018 season was a bit bonkers and especially so in their champions league run\\n\\nin their champions league group in which they were drawn with eventual winners kashima antlers suwon did not manage a single home win however they had managed to get two away wins and going into the final match they still had their fate in their own hands if they could win against group leaders kashima in japan they won 10 getting three away wins and topping the group\\n\\nmanager seo jungwon at a time when suwon were 4th in the league resigned the day before the first leg of their champions league quarterfinal clash with jeonbuk due to fan protests jeonbuk were apparently completely bamboozled by this event and took a 30 beating at home then in the return leg in suwon jeonbuk fought back to win 30 but suwon were able to scrape through on penalties to face kashima antlers yet again in the semis\\n\\nin the semifinal fixture suwon went 20 up against kashima antlers inside the first 10 minutes but went on to lose 32 in the first leg\\nsoon after manager seo returned as suddenly as he had departed having been gone for just 6 weeks  \\nin the second leg suwon went a goal down in the first half but came back with 3 in the second half to be on their way to the final after 60 mins played however kashima antlers fought back to get two more goals and win 65 on aggregate and would go on to win the final if you want to relive a part of that rollercoaster night here you gohttpsyoutuberxy8pagy1aq and heres an idea of the atmosphere that nighthttpstwittercomtheafcclstatus1055055104607285248\\n\\nat one point it looked like they might qualify for the champions league again for the 2019 season but suwon didnt win any of their final five league matches and dropped to 6th\\n\\nmanager seo left again at the end of the season and will manage japans sagan tosu recently captain kim eunsun was released from the club for drinkdriving the drama just never ends\\n\\ndaegu fc\\n\\nprior to the world cup daegu were languishing at the bottom of the table but after the return they found some kind of consistent form helped out by world cup hero goalkeeper jo hyeonwoo they really peaked at the right time as daegu made it to the fa cup final and against the odds defeated ulsan hyundai 51 on aggregate meaning for the first time they will feature in the champions league this is no mean feat for team whose best ever finish in the top flight is 7th place if they carry over their momentum into the 2019 season the year could be one of their most successful ever they will also be playing in a new footballspecific stadium this year\\n\\ngangwon fc\\n\\ngangwon are a fairly midbottom team i dont really know what to say about them they did have the 2ndhighest top scorer in the 2018 season though bosnian uros deric they also had the worst colour scheme in the league last season their kit is slightly improved this season\\n\\nincheon united\\n\\ni always like to imagine that incheon chose their strip so that they could be the inter to fc seouls ac milan they even have a nickname nerazzurri another nickname is the durumi    the cranes\\n\\nincheon spent most of the 2018 season at the very bottom of table and had the jointleakiest defence in the league they brought in norwegian manager jrn andersen midway through the season to turn their fortunes around but even after that they were on the wrong end or the biggest thrashing of the season 70 against gangwon coming into the end of the season though they were playing really nice attacking football even if they didnt always get the result at the split they were still bottom but won 4 out of 5 games to pull themselves up 3 places\\n\\nit was in attack that incheon shone montenegrin stefan mugosa was their top scorer in his debut season moon seonmin with the best goal celebration in the league also put in a strong performance but has now signed for champions jeonbuk nam junjae returned in the summer to score some bangers costa rican international aguilar was also impressive but has signed for jeju in the new season\\n\\nsangju sangmu\\n\\nthe military team where other k league players get loaned to to complete their military service their history goes far back in one sense as various military teams were playing way back to the 50s but they were founded for pro footballers to serve their time only in 1984 although they were for pro players they competed in the semipro national league until 2003 when they joined the k league based in gwangju when gwangju fc were formed they moved to sangju\\n\\nsangju sangmu do not have any foreign players for obvious reasons and cannot compete in the champions league although the chances of ever finishing in a qualifying spot are fairly slim\\n\\nfc seoul\\n\\nfc seoul wow what happened having won the league in 2016 albeit somewhat fortuitously and always finishing in the top half if not competing for the title in the past decade nobody expected seoul to be fighting against relegation although relatively solid defensively they scored the least number of goals in the league season of all teams their star foreign players almost all left before the season started including dejan to rivals suwon and were not replaced with the same quality and for many matches seoul played with an allkorean team one bit of good news for the future is that former captain osmar will return from his loan to cezero osaka for the new season\\n\\nseoul at least managed to avoid relegation by beating busan ipark over two legs in the playoff helped by a red card in the first leg surprisingly they managed to score 3 goals in the first leg in open play\\n\\nseoul is probably the most popular club in korea im sure helped by the fact that it is the main club in a city of 10 million people  seoul generally has the highest game attendances although it was much reduced last season because they were so crap\\n\\nstarting out as luckygoldstar ie lg fc in chungcheong province the team was permitted to relocate to seoul at the start of the 90s and were renamed as lg cheetahs during the decentralisation period they moved to anyang modifying their name to anyang lg cheetahs after the world cup the team successfully negotiated a move back to seoul and did away with their cheetahs moniker taking their current name fc seoul their founding and rebirth years are both on their badge  1983 and 2004\\n\\nseongnam fc\\n\\ngaining direct promotion due to asan mugunghwas situation seongnam is actually the most decorated team in korea\\n\\nfounded in 1989 in seoul as ilhwa chunma they were forced out of seoul and settled in cheonnan for a period in 2000 they moved to seongnam a satellite city of seoul and appended the city name to the name of the club seongnams title drought started when the head of the owner company that backed seongnam died in 2012 and the board were keen to let go of the club seongnam city government took over ownership of the club for the 2014 season and they were renamed seongnam fc seongnam are now back in k league 1 after a 2 year absence\\n\\nk league 2 clubs\\n\\nby last seasons standings\\n\\njeonnam dragons\\n\\njeonbuks jeolla province rivals they finished the previous season on an awful losing streak and were relegated for the first time\\n\\nasan mugunghwa\\n\\npolice fc they missed promotion despite winning k league 2 and will probably lose their police affiliation by next year\\n\\nbusan ipark\\n\\none of the founding members of the k league and another that effectively predates the k league busan were beaten by k league 1 opposition in the prorel playoff for the

transfer window activity\\n\\nfrom a monetary point of view korea is the biggest net exporterhttpsenynacokrviewaen20190131006600315sectionsportsindex of players in asia in the transfer market this winter window was no different with what i would say were the two biggest stories involving young homegrown korean talent going abroad\\n\\nthe first is that of jeonbuk and national team star centreback kim minjae nicknamed the monster there were rumours of an offer from english side watford but it wasnt clear if there ever was any offer or negotiations  kim himself said he did not know of any interest from watford it doesnt really matter now  kim signed with chinese side beijing sinobo guoan and will see champions league football with them in the new season being drawn in the same group as jeonbuk\\n\\nthe second is hwang inbeom who has signed for mls side vancouver whitecaps hwang inbeom played in k league 2 last season with asan mugunghwa and daejeon citizen but has impressed as a midfield playmaker and is currently seen as a replacement for ki sungyueng in the national team\\n\\nfor a recognisable name for western readers the best i have is englishman jordon mutch who signed for gyeongnam from crystal palace resulting in this awkward photo ophttpspbstwimgcommediadzg3adzvyaakrkqformatjpgnamemedium another recognisable name is mix diskerud on loan to ulsan from man city but he joined the previous year\\n\\nk league 1s top scorer marco left gyeongnam for hebei china fortune and his replacement is luc castaignos signed from sporting cp his stats in europe havent been great in recent years but he may fare better in korea\\n\\nthere were of course a few hundred domestic internal transfers and number of other foreign player signings  if you want the full list k league uniteds winter transfer trackerhttpwwwkleagueunitedcom2019012019kleaguewintertransfertrackerhtml has it all\\n\\n\\n\\nhistory of club football in korea  establishment of the k league\\n\\nassociation football was first introduced to korea in 1882 when british royal navy crew harboured at incheon played a game it wasnt until the 1900s that football began to take hold and the first public match was played in 1905 there was a boom in in the 1910s with a number of football clubs being formed and rivalries began to form between clubs in seoul and pyongyang\\n\\nthe first nationwide competition was the all joseon football tournament joseon being the name for korea at the time founded in 1921 there wasnt actually a champion crowned in 1921 as the tournament was cut short due to complaints over refereeing decisions all this was taking place during japanese occupation of korea during most of the first half of the 20th century\\n\\naccording to the kfahttpswebarchiveorgweb20170606162658httpkfaorkrrecordhistoryasp football was the only tonic that could relieve the the national resentment that had accumlated in the hearts as a colony under the japanese empire and was a sprout that could foster the hope of freedom a tad hyperbolic maybe\\n\\none side effect of being a japanese colony is that some korean teams were allowed to participate in the emperors cup japans fa cup and in 1935 kyungsung fc kyungsung was a name for seoul during japanese occupation won the tournament becoming the only nonjapanese team to ever do so\\n\\nthe all joseon football tournament ran until wwii\\n\\nafter wwii came korean independence and shortly thereafter the korean war there was football being played during this period continuously when possible the korean national semiprofessional football league was founded in 1964 and is the predecessor to todays tier 3 national league many of the teams during this period were works teams  employed by a company playing under the name of the company but also having a proper job in the company cha bumkun said by some to be the greatest ever asian footballer rose to fame during this period albeit mainly in the bundesliga starting his senior career at the mighty seoul trust bank fc the most astonishing statistic about cha bumkun is he only received one yellow card in his career\\n\\nfinally we get to the establishment of professional football with the korean super league in 1983 now named the k league initially there were only 5 teams and 2 of those teams dropped out within 2 years the number of clubs in the top flight has varied from the initial 5 to a high of 16 in 2011 in 2013 the k league split into two tiers now k league 1 and k league 2\\n\\nfor the first few years of the k league teams did not have a fixed home stadium that they played in because there was no standard homeaway format that we are so familiar with today instead it was operated as a national tour\\n\\nthe k league in the modern era has its own history but one of the most interesting events was the forced exodus of all three clubs from seoul in 1996 as part of a policy to spread the popularity of football around the country also with an eye on stadium infrastructure for the 2002 world cup two of the clubs didnt move far only just outside the city of seoul each to one of seouls satellite cities yukong elephants only halfleft because the city they moved to didnt have a stadium yet so they continued to play in seoul until a new stadium was built for a number of years the k league was without any seoul representation in 2004 after the need to find someone to fill a great big national football stadium and help pay towards it one of those relocated teams moved back to seoul becoming fc seoul\\n\\n\\n\\nfootball pyramid  league format\\n\\nthe current system looks like this\\n\\n\\n tier  league  notes \\n\\n 1  k league 1 12 teams 1 relegation to k league 2 1 relegation playoff with k league 2\\n 2  k league 2  10 teams 1 promotion to k league 1 1 promotion playoff with k league 2\\n 3  national league  8 teams semipro no promotionrelegation\\n 4  k3 league advanced  12 teams semiproamateur 2 relegations to k3 league basic 1 relegation playoff with k3 league basic \\n 5  k3 league basic 11 teams semiproamateur 2 promotions to k3 league advanced 1 promotion playoff with k3 league advanced \\n 6 division 5 league 6 regional leagues with 52 teams some relegation to division 6 \\n 7  division 6 league 26 regional leagues with 174 teams some prorel with divisions 5  7 \\n 8  division 7 league 160 regional leagues with 960 teams some promotion with division 6 \\n\\nas you can see the naming is completely screwed up  k3 league occupies tiers 4 and 5 and division 5 is in tier 6 this is probably because the top tier k league only split in two in 2013 with the creation on k league 2 and nobodys been bothered to update their names\\n\\nthe national league sits stubbornly in tier 3 blocking any continuous prorel the powers that be have regularly stated that they want to reform the pyramid to have a continuous route from top to bottom at least to the bottom of k3 league within a few years but for some reason its not happening the winners of the 2006 national league season were offered promotion to the k league but they declined the offer the winners of the 2007 season were also offered promotion but declined again even though they said they would like promotion at the start of the season\\n\\none of the more recent additions to the k league bucheon fc 1995 joined from k3 league because they didnt want to pay the higher fees associated with starting out in the national league\\n\\noutside of this system there is the wk league the womens top tier the wk league has been dominated by incheon red angels no connection to incheon united in recent years theres no womens champions league in asia yet but for a few years in the past the winners of the wk league played the winners of japans nadeshiko league for a little more info on the wk league see this reddit posthttpswwwredditcomrwomenssoccercommentsaqkew5southkoreasroutetotheworldcupthewkleague\\n\\nalso worth a mention is the separate u league for universities and colleges some of the teams from which enter into the korean fa cup the route into a pro team in korea is often direct from high school or university teams something i dont think exists in europe some high school teams are even seen as feeder teams for a particular pro team i wont pretend to understand how the system works but ill leave you with the tidbit that park jisung was first signed to a professional team from a university team almost by accident as the scout had come to see a different player but took home park instead\\n\\nk league 1\\n\\nk league 1 consists of 12 teams playing 38 games the format is identical to the scottish premiership  all teams play each other three times and then after the split the top 6 and bottom 6 battle it out among themselves to settle the championship and relegation spots respectively the first tie breaker for teams level on points is goals scored rather than goal difference\\n\\nthe top 3 places offer a chance in the afc champions league the fourth champions league spot going to the winner of the korean fa cup bottom place gets relegated to k league 2 whilst 11th place has a playoff with one of the teams that finished 2nd4th in k league 2\\n\\ninternational context\\n\\nin the current format of the afc champions league the competition is split into a west region think uae saudi arabia qatar iran and an east region the east region is dominated by three nations  korea china and japan australia who decided it wanted to be asian earlier this century has also had a bit of success\\n\\nthis year there will be two debutants from korea  gyeongnam fc and daegu fc its dufficult to predict how well these two will fare but if they can carry some form over to this year they could get out of the group stages at least\\n\\ndetermining who has the strongest teams amongst the big three east asian nations is a difficult task and is hugely subjective im almost i say almost because obviously k league is best league of the opinion that theyre as close to equal as makes no difference korea has the most number of titles and the club with the most titles pohang steelers china have the highest coefficient japan has won the past two tournaments\\n\\nin recent years china and japan have had a number of big star foreigner signings eg paulinho torres which are absent from the k league i believe this is due to japan having cash mainly coming from tv money and china having cash from well being china despite korea lagging financially all three nations have the same limit on foreign players three foreigners plus one from another afc country and so korean teams are still competitive due to the relative strength of their domestic players\\n\\nwhile were on the topic of the champions league each of the big three east asian nations get 4 places total  2 or 3 to the group stages and 1 or 2 to the last qualifying playoff round before the group stages this playoff round is massively weighted in the big threes favour as they have to win just one home game when the weather is still genrally freezing cold against a team from a nation with a tropical climate i dont know of a korean club ever losing this playoff match\\n\\nthe afc cup is sometimes said to be the equivalent of uefas europa league but its not really comparable the afc cup is for the weaker asian nations only and korea arent allowed to enter\\n\\n\\n\\nresources\\n\\nwebsites  podcasts\\n\\nfor those of us

saying k1 it helps if you know how korean letters sound phonetically to understand which teams are playing but you can also see which match a video is from the crests in the thumbnail the commentary will be in korean but each video is really good quality typically about 10 minutes long\\n\\nif you watch to watch live the good news is that is very easy and basically free i have no idea whether any national broadcasters or streaming services around the world have k league rights but in korea itself essentially every thing is streamed on korean online behemoth navers platform the one caveat is that live streams are region locked so to access them youll need a vpn to get a korean ip address although some other asian countries also seem to have access i wont repeat what others have already

unable to speak the year she turned nineteen she met the monk buseol and upon meeting him was suddenly able to speak for the first time in her life as he began to leave she clung to him crying i can speak because of you if you were to leave there would be no life for me if you wont marry me ill kill myself as soon as you go buseol thought to himself what kind of disciple of the buddha would i be if i were to go and leave her to die id disgrace the buddha and violate the spirit of his teachings above all i should save her life how could i hope to move forward and eventually achieve enlightenment if i dont face the problems that are now right in front of me with this view he gave up the monastic life and married her such a compassionate heart\\n\\none day two buddhist monks who used to practice with buseol called on him because he had married they treated him with contempt and spoke roughly to him however he remained calm and received them warmly he treated them well and never argued over the things they were saying such deep compassion and wisdom such profound meaning in his actions\\n\\nnevertheless buseol felt that he couldnt let them leave without doing something about their mistaken views so he filled three gourds with water and hung them in a row next he told the monks to each break a gourd when each monk hit his gourd the gourd broke and the water fell to the ground however when buseol hit his gourd the gourd shattered and the pieces fell to the ground but the water just dangled there it was suspended in the shape of the gourd as if it were rozen when the two monks saw this they realized that they had been mistaken about hte level of buseols spiritual practice after some reflection they apologized saying until now weve paid attention to only theories without having tried to put htem into practice further we didnt discard the stubbornness and arrogance that arose from the idea of our having studied under so many great seon masters please forgive us then they bowed deeply to buseol who looked like just another poor woodcutter buseol then told them that the physical body is like the gourds they broke whereas their inherent nature is like the water dangling in the air he taught them that our inherent nature remains just as it is and is never caught by anything with this the two monks became his disciples\\n\\n\\n\\nfurther info from the glossary of the same book\\n\\nbuseol he was born in the silla kingdom of korea probably around the year 610 ce he was ordained at bulguk temple and spent more than a decade living on duryun

the inkroin empire but for all their efforts their sacrifices made and their lives lost there had never been a single successful defense against the inkroins as time passed and as oncegreat nations collapsed one by one leaders of countries accepted that their fates were sealed as soon as they received the declaration of war\\n\\nno one knew how or why the inkroins first began their conquest to purge the galaxy of every other being those who knew the reason had long since been executed by the emperors infamous death squad known for purging every last member of a species by any means

remaining planet still controlled by the zumit republic\\n\\nwhen president zachary currier delivered a speech on the newly constructed maimi interplantry spaceport as the worlds first ftl capable ship launched into orbit no one in the galaxy took note of the fledgling species as empires turned into ashes that was a mistake that would cause the inkroins to beg for mercy at the feet of humanity\\n\\nthere was no astronomer on earth who didnt note the craters the ashes and the smokes left behind as a result of the careless destruction of inkroins on their crusade to purge the galaxy

often instead of partying with the crew every night\\n\\nthe jump towards  if he recalled correctly  the system of sol went out without a hitch corvettes at the front powered up their blink engines

this single planet civilization inhabited by bipedal mammals with almost no physical bodily strength compared to themselves would have been easy money for everyone involved at least thats how it

silence\\n\\nthe communication crew was panicking  58 of the total 60 corvettes had suddenly lost contact with the dreadnought the ships didnt fall off the communication system it was just that no one responded to any message but before anyone could have figured it out hundred of gauss cannons railguns missile launchers autocannons and artillery fired their payload towards the first fleet instantly detonating almost every ship that was left omhor desperately shouted for every ship to attack the enemy but it was far too late before he realized that there were no more ships to respond to his

twothird supermajority ', 'selftext': ' south korean national assembly election is about 2 weeks away and there is a sudden surge of support for the left in the polls and local media are talking about a twothirds supermajority of the leftwing bloc as support for the ruling rightwing people power party ppp crumbles in this post i want to talk about why this happened and try to explain the current political climate in south korea\\n\\n\\n1 left in disarray lee jaemyungs dumpster fire\\n\\n\\n until march the south korean left was in crisis as infighting over lee jaemyung the controversial leader of the democratic party dpk intensified his purge of dissidents within the party and his corruption caused the fragmentation of the dpk leading to the party splitting into several smaller entities meanwhile the ruling conservative people power party ppp was gaining support as they focused on expanding the healthcare workforce however everything changed when president yoon sokyoel launched a brazen attack on the rule of law and press freedom to cover up an accident within the military\\n\\n\\n2 mystery of a drowned marine corporal defense minister on the run  journalists threatened with knife attack\\n\\n\\n this story dates back to july 19th 2023 when a great flood hit north gyeongsang province prompting the deployment of marines for search and rescue operations during the operation a marine corporal drowned due to the lack of proper equipment such as a life jacket provided by the command subsequent military police investigations revealed negligence among the commanding officers leading to a report submitted to the ministry of defense for civilian scrutiny\\n\\n however defense minister lee jongsup acted unlawfully to protect the commanding officers the military police who filed the report were fired and the minister covered up the incident sparking a major scandal that ultimately led to his resignation following his resignation he came under investigation by the corruption investigation office cio while the scandal initially faded from public consciousness as the investigation progressed it resurfaced when lee jongsup was appointed as the ambassador to australia and had his cio travel ban lifted by the ministry of justice moj this clear indication of a presidentiallevel coverup reignited public interest prompting journalists to investigate further\\n\\n during their inquiries hwang shangmu a civil society secretary to the president met with journalists to discuss the matter over a meal during the meeting hwang who claimed to be a former military intelligence member recounted a chilling incident from 1988 involving a journalist who had inquired about the military and was stabbed with a knife by military intelligence personnel this was clearly a veiled threat on journalists this revelation alarmed the journalists present especially amidst a spate of recent knife attacks on political figures making it headline news\\n\\n\\n3 angry voters conservatives in crisis\\n\\n\\n this proved disastrous for the rightwing government as they were actively aiding a corrupt crony in evading justice while threatening journalists with knife attacks during the campaign season this exacerbated existing popular discontent with the governments austerity measures and antilabor policies the targeted journalists became openly hostile toward the government and the media began discussing how the arrogant and dogmatic government should be punished\\n\\n the ruling party began distancing itself from the government and demanded the resignation of the ambassador and the secretary eventually these two problematic officials resigned but the incident left a bitter taste for the electorate\\n\\n recent polls indicate a collapse in support for the ruling ppp and a rise in support for opposition parties some polls even suggest that the leftwing bloc might secure a twothirds supermajority the threshold needed for overriding a presidential veto and implementing constitutional reform according to polling conducted by the prominent business newspaper hankuk gyungjae the ppp is expected to secure only 9596 seats out of 300 with the rest dominated by the leftwing bloc composed of the justice party dpk and its splinter groups\\n\\n\\n4 cho kuk demagogue galvanizing the left \\n\\n\\n in the midst of this chaos an unlikely figure from the past has emerged to galvanize the left cho kuk a former justice minister who resigned in 2019 amidst a corruption scandal involving his daughters university admission has resurfaced he was compelled to step down after then prosecutor general yoon yokyoel initiated an investigation into his corruption upon his resignation cho alleged a vast conspiracy among prosecutors to subvert the democratic government in korea however as he was found guilty of his crimes in court he gradually faded from public memory\\n\\n this month however he has made a sudden return to the political scene he established a new party called the national innovation party nip and declared war on yoon his message of animosity towards yoon and prosecutors is resonating with voters his fiery rhetoric about rendering yoon a dead duck through constitutional reform or impeachment is gaining popularity the nip is surging in the polls and his strategy of abstaining from fielding candidates in firstpastthepost fptp seats and focusing on proportional representation pr seats is expected to increase the number of seats for the leftwing bloc\\n\\n\\n5 conclusion yoon sokyoel is pushing the south korean public toward the left \\n\\n\\n yoon sokyoel has never been a popular president his presidential campaign which utilized antifeminism backfired spectacularly as his margin of victory fell under 1 many pollsters expected a 5 or higher win for the conservative candidate this campaign method incited hatred toward conservatives among young female voters solidifying support for the left the supposed support of young males which was not concrete to begin with collapsed when his government attempted to undermine working conditions the military coverup of the marines death further eroded support among young males many of whom are subject to conscription and deeply concerned about conditions in the military as a result young men are caring less and less about feminism and expressing concerns over the governments assault on their living standards older individuals with nationalistic tendencies are expressing anger over his attempts to improve relations with japan yoons arrogant behavior and forceful policy implementation have disgusted swing voters\\n\\n the election is filled with uncertainty and it is unclear whether the current political climate will persist until election day the polls that predict twothird supermajority for the left are conducted by large rightwing media outlets like chosenilbo or prominent business newspapers which dont align with polls conducted by other outlets which indicate a victory for the left similar to 2020 but not supermajority but one thing is clear if the leftwing bloc secures an electoral victory despite its leadership being infested with incompetent crooks like lee and cho yoon has no one to blame but himself his arrogance and antilabor policies have driven voters toward the left even when the leftwing parties are in complete disarray at the moment in south korean politics there are always consequences for bad behavior\\n\\nthe general election will be held on april 10th and early voting is to be carried out on april 5th  6th \\n\\n'}, {'title': 'why havent korean opted for a federaldecentralized government in its thousands year history', 'selftext': 'i just feel like it would make more sense

peninsula and parts of manchuria gija joseon was purportedly founded in the 12th century bce but its existence and role have been controversial in the modern era in 108 bce the han dynasty defeated wiman joseon and installed four commanderies in the northern korean peninsula three of the commanderies fell or retreated westward within a few decades as lelang commandery was destroyed and rebuilt
